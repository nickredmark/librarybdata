<p begin="00:00:46.640" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">glitch but it turned out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">technical glitch</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">and not not user error in either of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">parts all right at least that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">conclusion we&#39;ve arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">all right um so in q for q a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">number 25 we got this question hi</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">bretton heather i&#39;m an 8th grade teacher</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">searching for advice to pass out to my</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">students who are incredibly weary of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">world they&#39;re growing up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">especially now what advice would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">now in part i wanted to just flag this</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">as something that you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">chapter on schools</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">and another one on childhood in the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">that we&#39;re writing um but this is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">a critical question and maybe you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">to riff for just a minute yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">i mean i think really for all of us who</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">searching for a silver lining here</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at me like i&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">joke no i&#39;m going to do my best okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">to actually give some sort of useful</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">solace</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">i think really actually this is true and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">this is what i tell myself and it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">i would tell my kids if they asked and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what i would tell your kids if</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">they asked</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">change is directly correlated to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">the level of disturbance</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">and so to the extent that we find</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">ourselves facing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">very uncertain things in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">it is also um something that will tend</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">to accompany a transition to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">so in evolutionary terms this is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">adaptive valley</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">whether there&#39;s a peak on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">i sure hope there is but um</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">the potential for change is here as is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">all right it&#39;s uh it&#39;s the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the beginning of an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">answer i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">no i think we we we need years</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">to provide the complete excellent answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s you&#39;ve provided</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">directions to the foothill we need years</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">we have hours</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">next question again from number 25</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">rather than today drugs are always a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">controversial subject</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">some are considered medicines others</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">controlled substances i think if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">helps someone it&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">a medicine period what are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">about marijuana fungi</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">and psychedelics hashtag legalize nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">so this is something that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">addressed um a few times but uh because</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">it came</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">at a high money value from someone who</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">clearly hasn&#39;t heard us talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">at all about this i thought we&#39;d give it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">a minute or two sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">so i would i would say number one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">is these things can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">very useful they can be uh a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">tremendous relief they can provide</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">insight i would say number one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">is don&#39;t treat them as recreational</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">they are very serious and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">mean you shouldn&#39;t have a great time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">have a smile on your face</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">as you do but treating them as frivolous</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">is a mistake they&#39;re powerful enough to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">great things and they are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">enough to mess you up</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">i would say curate your experience such</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">that it stands a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">of being productive but</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">if you think these things aren&#39;t for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">they probably aren&#39;t if you think they</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">might be for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">engage cautiously think carefully about</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">the damage you may do to your health</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">the molecule and the way it&#39;s delivered</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">in the case of marijuana you can mess up</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">your lungs if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">smoke it so maybe consider doing it some</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">other way which is now much easier than</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">it once was</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">um but a cautious</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">positive view of these substances and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">their potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">but advice to to engage them carefully</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">yeah and i guess i would just add the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">hashtag that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">person who asked the question ends with</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">legalized nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">is an apt one uh that at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">has even if it&#39;s been derived uh from a</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">but synthesized in a lab such that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">has no</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">resemblance at all to uh the plant or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">animal or more often fungus from which</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">it derived</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">to have very little resemblance</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">uh to uh the state that it might have</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">uh if you were imbibing it from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">organism in which it came so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">um you know you can use that very broad</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">rubric that sort of rule of thumb to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">okay you know avoid</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">avoid those things which require that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">you stick a needle in your arm or</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">or start powder up your nose uh and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">that there is both long evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">relationship between humans and many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">species and maybe more importantly</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">easily found and filmed</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">tells you something about how reasonable</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">or you&#39;re deciding to provide those</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">else around two distinct registers i</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">thought it might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">like a focal fry or like i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">so i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">i take it to be male and female um so</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve asked a very deep question which</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">would require a book to answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">but let me simplify it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">one the distinction between singing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">is a new one so it would have been true</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">until very recently until the invention</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">of musical instruments</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">that music was inherently vocal and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">contained lyrics it was inherently</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">lyrical almost all the time it would</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">also be true</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">that all that basically every intact</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">human would have a direct relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">with music they wouldn&#39;t just consume it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">they would participate</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">in the creation of it and music wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">static</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">it used to be that even the songs that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">sung were songs that changed over time</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">right so even the standards were never</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">the same twice and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">at some point the invention of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">player piano songs start to be the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">twice and then that gets really bad in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">the era of recorded music oh but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">before that at the point that music is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">being written down in the baroque era</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">there&#39;s that you have repeated</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">music oh you have repetition you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">always had that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">but the idea of exact repetition</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">i think i think that at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">the baroque era was upon us or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">even earlier i&#39;d known far less about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">what came before the baroque but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">um you know we we know what could have</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">been and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">was being played over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">again from</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">boy bach would have been 1600s i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">um so you know repetition has been going</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">on for</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">you know as long as the written word so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">you think music has been broke</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">far longer than i think it has but uh i</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">was walking into that one</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">yeah you did you set yourself up um but</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">so let&#39;s put it this way there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">something to be said about the player</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">piano being the first point at which the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">song might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">the same twice but i agree with you you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">know written music</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">does invite the attempt to produce the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">song twice and a conductor might</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">do the same rendition twice so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">they&#39;d be very close</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">but this is all of it is a departure</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">from the natural state of music</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">which would almost always have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">lyrical and would always have been vocal</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">until</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the invention of the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.320" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">musical instrument so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">the uh answer to the question is really</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">going to be found in what is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">evolutionary advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">uh vocal music right</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to leave you hanging there</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">one of the things you need to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">in order to address this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">is the close connection that music has</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">to the production</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">of language and uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">anyway i have a long-standing hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">here which needs to be explored at some</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">yeah we should we should devote an hour</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">or more uh to this at some point but</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">um this one thing that just occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">which had never really occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">before is that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">as as you know i was i was trained in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">classical piano played for</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">you know practice for a couple hours a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:58.320" style="s2">day for many years during my my</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">childhood</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.320" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">and um so the baroque period</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">sort of happened and i don&#39;t know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">about you know what exactly happened</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">before them but baroque</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">was during in part the era of clavichord</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">and harpsichord where there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">possibility you did you didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">as you did with the piano the piano</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">forte which was the thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">changed about the keyboard was now you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">could play softly or loudly right</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">um and it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">very much uh as i understand it you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">the baroque</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">led to the classical period and in both</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">of those both of those cases</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">yes the musician who was playing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">music could change</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">what was being played but you really</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">weren&#39;t supposed to stray</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">at least for you know someone playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">individual piano music from the baroque</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">like bach and then the classical period</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">you know beethoven um</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">brahms haydn etc were very much supposed</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">to be played as they were written</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">whereas then you move into the romantic</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">period in the 19th century like chopin</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">and tchaikovsky and such</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">and you suddenly get a lot more freedom</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">again you know sometimes they&#39;d stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">many notes into a single measure that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">you could just you know do kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">want it dynamically and metrically and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">it was almost like a return</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">to what music was what music was before</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">um before i feel like the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">drum the you know the the metronomic</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">of things from the baroque period</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know what all that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">was about like why that happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">um well i mean i think you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">right track in the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">elaborateness of the instruments and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">case of the harpsichord in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">the mechanistic nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">instruments</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">um invites a more mechanistic playing</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">style so you think the technology may</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">have driven</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">the musical style yeah anyway none of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">almost um is is about singing which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it is the original</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">instrument of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">and and amazing um okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">next question jury nullification we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">lawyers</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">at all are taught to ignore it</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">closed do we pry the litter jar by even</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">asking the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">well it&#39;s been asked um you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the first time if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">uh heard us talk about it i know eric</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">has talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">jury nullification for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">the ability of a jury to decide</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">that even though so courts do two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">findings of fact and findings of law</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">so in a court you establish what took</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">place and then you decide whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">a violation</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">of the law the jury has the ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">the capacity to neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">the law part in other words it can</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">decide that you did something</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">and it can reason that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">even though it was a violation of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">that it is going to rule as if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">thereby</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">freeing you right so this is in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">sense a protection that exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">because we can all imagine extenuating</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">uh in which one in which a miscarriage</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">of justice would occur by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">application of the law so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">a jury could potentially do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">is a protection however basically my</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">understanding is that judges</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">instruct juries that they do not have</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">this right and the hope is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">right will effectively never be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">exercised because the mayhem that could</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:37.919" style="s2">arise from its exercise</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">is massive</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">and in this case we have the near</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">certainty</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">that many things that are violations of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">the law and severe ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">will not be penalized because we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">told that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">certain people are uh in debt and others</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">are uh in surplus and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s one more place where</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">reparations can happen your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">right to violate the law may go up if</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">you have certain demographic markers</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a very frightening prospect</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">even more frightening is the prospect of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">the other thing which maybe it has a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">must have a name that i just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">where somebody who has not violated the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">law is going to be convicted</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">because of some sense that they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">morally deserving of being punished</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">and um i am very afraid that both of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">these processes</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">are very proactive no it&#39;s not proactive</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">what is it it&#39;s like activist</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">yeah jury activism or it&#39;s legislative</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">jury activists i don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">would call it but the idea that juries</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">will effectively be empowered to punish</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t done anything wrong i</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">mean for one thing we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">equivalent of that without a jury</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">in these cases where people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">fired not having done anything wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">well you know you know much more about</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">the law than i do but given that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">findings of facts and findings of law</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">that are the two things</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">um that a jury is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">deliberating on</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">don&#39;t findings of fact have to come</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">before findings of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">of law and if if you if the findings of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">say there is nothing that happened here</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">do you even get to move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">findings of law</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s a well right i&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">expert here either but yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">effectively the facts either have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">support the possibility that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">violation of law or not so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">a jury that wanted to could neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">this in either place it can decide that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">a fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">that fabric could it could it could come</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">to an untrue conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">on the findings of fact front thus</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">opening up the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">of a punitive uh decision over in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">findings of law territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">right and of course the judge is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">uh fail-safe mechanism you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">judge that finds the jury engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">deliberations that it shouldn&#39;t can</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">declare a mistrial but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">you know where in the system is anybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">immunized from being accused of racial</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">wrongdoing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">in the modern era so everybody is going</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">to start recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">um that they might need to do what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">mob demands and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">i mean as i keep saying it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">uninvention of america</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.840" style="s2">and wow are we in danger if this keeps</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">yeah next question can the emotion of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">awe</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">unite us back again</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">um that&#39;d be great and i like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">i&#39;m a little bit concerned that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">something about modernity</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">has made us hard to impress yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">that we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">all privy to the most extreme uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">demonstrations of capacity and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve all been transported to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">most marvelous beach on earth you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">which has further more than been</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">photoshopped</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">right right so yeah we we all imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">that the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">beautiful person and the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">beautiful place and the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">beautiful everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">is not only um something we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">experienced even if we haven&#39;t but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">better than it is such that when we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">experience true</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">awesomeness in our lives we often don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">recognize it as such because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">live up to the unphotoshopped</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">uh unperfected version of itself yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">that said i do think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">things that will galvanize us or could</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">galvanize us</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">and um one of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">i am hoping is the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">that there is a way out of this that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">will in fact make us feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">ourselves again</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">and i am a little bit concerned that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">unfortunately i find myself in</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">trying to write what that would be like</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">it is very hard for me to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">hope now because i feel that um</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">the obama administration was</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">such a disappointment in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">it accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">that um many of us felt his hope</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">we we signed on and then we&#39;re quickly</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">disappointed it has almost poisoned the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">concept of hope</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">and um that leaves us grasping for</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">synonyms that are never as good this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">interesting i didn&#39;t know you were you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">were thinking on this and i knew</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">i know what you&#39;re trying to write right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">now but um i actually went looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">specifically i was i was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">something to read at the end of the last</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">hour that would be hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">rather than you know rather than so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">else and i must have you know a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">10 books downstairs all of which i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">are extraordinary and i couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">anything and the closest i came</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">actually um but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">something to read from it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">um was from joseph campbell you know i</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">went to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">the the hero with a thousand faces um in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">part because we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">um one of the things we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">about between</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">this last live stream and the last one</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">was was the hero&#39;s journey and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">um trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">reveal to people that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">they can take hold of that for</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">that uh in trying to face this thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">it is not sufficient to take individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">action and yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">it is in many cases the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">and well um i would like to propose</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">something that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">get to in depth today was a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">of what what you do um when</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">it comes knocking and maybe i mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">we want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">next time yeah i think we want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">next time and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">take the time to do it do it right but</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">there is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">i do have the sense that the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.840" style="s2">much bigger place</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">than it was and the hero&#39;s journey is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.840" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">it contains a great deal of truth but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">also may be at the wrong scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">and so the question is can we figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">how to scale it up</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">to a world with seven and a half billion</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">people on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">that is simultaneously in crisis and if</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a frightening question but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">also kind of a delightful opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">and so maybe that&#39;s where we are as</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">the the new twist on the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">because we need it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">next question while there are many</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">domestic issues going on i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">that international issues are being</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">ignored at our risk</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">would you please have general robert</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">spalding retired on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">he wrote a very revealing book recently</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">about the chinese communist party</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">i&#39;d look at it um it&#39;s i agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">i think we are missing the international</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">component of this as we are hobbling</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">ourselves at home</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">our enemies are licking their chops yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no question about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">and the fact that uh half the country</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">has the sense that anything that comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">out of the president&#39;s mouth is</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">inherently wrong and ludicrous uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">means that for him to have for trump to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">have said anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">about chinese involvement uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">in this virus means that half of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">country now has a knee-jerk reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">ignoring that is a very possibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">a great example</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">right we can&#39;t even talk about the facts</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">of what this virus is and where it came</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">from because trump has</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">taken a position and that causes others</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">to be completely unable to hear</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">um even factual information yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">anti-intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">yep why are yawns contagious in quotes</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">are they similarly contagious in other</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">primates do you think ideas expressed</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">before yawn might piggyback on the yawn</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">to be spread more effectively in a group</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting uh i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">never thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know about the last piece</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">yeah i did have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">a kind of a riff on yawns but it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">years and i don&#39;t have it at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">tip of my tongue um there is i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">something about state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">and that effectively yawns are something</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">that spreads because it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">feeling of security sufficient that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">sleep would be acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">and so you can imagine a you know pride</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">that could be an indicator of trust even</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an indicator of i perceive</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">that this is secure</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">uh and that spreads to the group and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">anyway that raises all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">questions and it maybe predicts</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">certain things about the way it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">functions but it is fascinating and yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">it is contagious</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">in multiple different kinds of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">now i wondered at the time that i was</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">working on this whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">contagious between types of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">which would be very interesting yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">and i don&#39;t i don&#39;t remember whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">there&#39;s any evidence yeah i have never</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">seen an analysis of that anecdotally it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really look like it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">um you know when when we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">watching you know wild primates for</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">um and they they go on a yawning bout it</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to track into</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">us or other things or you know when our</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">cats start yawning</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">um it spreads through them but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">spread to the dog</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">yes but that&#39;s you know that&#39;s anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">i am</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">i would put money on but not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">money on the idea that actually that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">not been looked at</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d cross species contagion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">yawning but within species contagion yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">yeah and at least some so at least some</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">other primates and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">seems to be at least domestic um</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">companions it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">widespread it is though which suggests</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s only mammals still</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:15.120" style="s2">widespread</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">yeah right but the question is is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.120" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">convergently widespread or is it ancient</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">and we&#39;ve all inherited it from some</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">yawning ancestor yawning tree shrew</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">yeah something like that um</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">okay next question do we need to make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">costly for every coward that throws</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">their towel in with either extreme</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">especially in media academics and power</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">let everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">know now we will not forget reason will</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">prevail we will remember those who</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">betrayed it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">we will not forgive so that&#39;s a yep</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">little hard to read</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">do we need to make it costly yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">and in fact that&#39;s why we have this</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">term and why we use it what term coward</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">um so uh if you look back in the various</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">tapes of us talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">we have spoken frequently about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">epidemic of cowardice yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">that is a message to those who did not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">stand up</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">and to those who are looking at them to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">that that is not the honorable position</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">the problem is what you cannot do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">tell people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">stand up and it will be safe so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">is the cowardice is really about</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">but yeah turning up the heat on</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.799" style="s2">is the right move you have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">honorably but</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">especially what i would say is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">the cowardice that i am</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">least sympathetic with is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">cowardice of people who can afford to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">something else the cowardice for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">at the head of the democratic party is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">despicable</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">and it is um i can&#39;t say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">criminally treason but it is in effect</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">treasonous because we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">destroy</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">the nation uh in an effort to let those</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">people not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">say what they should full well</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">understand so yes turn up the heat</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">broken and the solution it&#39;s handed us</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">is so inadequate and the danger is so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">great that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">um many people have years to hear if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">deliver them a version of the plan that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">heather in one of the earlier live</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">streams you mentioned that vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">supplementation isn&#39;t the same as</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">getting vitamin d from sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">could you elaborate on this thanks and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">much love to you both</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">the i can&#39;t say a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">about vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">in particular but the logic is is this</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">uh that our modern uh reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">approach to health tends to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">finding isolating quantifying</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">and then prescribing in the form of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">actual prescription or just</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">over-the-counter</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">pills the thing that is now imagined to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">be what is keeping you from health and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">this is um it is it is reductionism that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">the flaw here and also a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">scientism sensulata wherein um</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">a scientific approach allowed for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">naming and quantification and synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">but no one took a step back and looked</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">at the whole system which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">inherently complex and said okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">the value of this within the system</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">and does it have interplay with other</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">parts and of course it does</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">so we have any number of examples in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">which something has been isolated</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">and then it turns out that that is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">the thing that was actually necessary in</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">the way that we thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">but it was something that was easily</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">easily found easily named easily pointed</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">and then turns out in isolation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">do nearly as much</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">good so it&#39;s possible that some of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">will actually work</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">in isolation it&#39;s possible that vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">d supplementation</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">is just as good as as uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">as getting it through your skin but i</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">would i would put the chances of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">close to zero</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">um just as uh well</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">well i was gonna say we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">these cases where</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">the problem is you&#39;re using the logic</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">of simple systems on a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">so for example um why am i blanking on</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">name for the loss of calcium from bones</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">with age</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">osteoporosis osteoporosis right in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">case of osteoporosis well there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">enough calcium in the bones</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">obviously give the person calcium they</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">don&#39;t metabolize it why would that be</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">well you&#39;re dealing with a complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">system and the whole reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">calcium is lost from the bones in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">first place isn&#39;t what you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">so the simple fact of dumping calcium on</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">the system doesn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">uh this is this is a perfect and pure</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">osteoporosis is caused by lack of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">calcium therefore just add calcium</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">right no it&#39;s an evolved system it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">going to work that way will occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">a system work that simply</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">maybe sure but the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to work with simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">supplementation there&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:43.359" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">which we referred to in in our book</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.359" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">which um is reminiscent</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">which points out that some of the error</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">in this kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve forgotten the author but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s called the tyranny of metrics</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s it&#39;s a short book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">really extraordinary it points to how</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">this kind of pseudonumerate thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">has uh managed to finagle its way into</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">medicine into education</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">into all sorts of places where it has no</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">business being</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">yep and uh in this case you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">we moved indoors that blocked the sun</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">we produce vitamin d through contact</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">with the sun through a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">photosynthesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">and supplementing is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">an excellent way to replace it now there</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">are modes of supplementation that do</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">seem to work that involve things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">uh fish oil um but these are cultures</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">that have a long history of having had</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">to supplement because of very cold</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">winters for example so</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">the the simple lesson very very high</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">latitude so like cod</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">cod liver oil turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">a way to get the vitamin the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">of the vitamin d that you need</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">which was a discovery by uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">scandinavians and vikings</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">um not because they knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">looking for that thing but because those</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">people who ate a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">food survived better right they did and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">they may have carried some mythology</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">along with i&#39;m sure they did</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">what it was but um but the simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">is when you disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">living systems you invite consequences</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t see because these systems are</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">complex and there are things you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">understand about how they work</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">so the idea that you can just simply</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">blaze in there and remedy them with</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">the obvious technological fix often</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">yeah go in the sun avoid sunscreen</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">don&#39;t get a sunburn by taking little</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">breaks in the shade</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">that would be i think the best most</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">useful advice</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">yep given the status of things is there</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">any genuine recourse aside from</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">networking and massing militias</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">i like being hopeful as much as the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">guy but we know what this is and where</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">it goes for the helpless</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">um well yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">it kind of depends where where in</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">civilization you stand whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">useful things to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">i think there are important plays to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">make that could take this disaster and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">something useful but i don&#39;t know any of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">them that don&#39;t involve</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">an outbreak of leadership in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">reason becomes a capacity of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">so are you hoping for an epidemic of</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">think the end game and ultimate goal of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">the critical race theory and affiliated</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">studies and movements is some variant of</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">african-american independence</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a faction that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">may be trying for that but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s actually dominant i think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">about amassing power</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">and wielding power over all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">yeah i mean i don&#39;t even know you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">voluntary separatist movements yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">but again i mean how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">even if you thought this divorce was</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">smart and i think it&#39;s stupid but</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">if you thought this divorce was smart</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">right we&#39;re not geographically separable</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">frankly we&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">separable as people because the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">intermixing has</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">been uh extreme you know to our credit</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">yeah but i mean this person isn&#39;t saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">could we do it this is the end game and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">the ultimate goal</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">you know do some people over in critical</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">race theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">and affiliated studies um hold that as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">i think some do i think you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">desperately confused</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">about what what it means um</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">but i think that it is it is a faction</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">factional perspective yeah i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">mostly mythological but</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">anyway yes there will be those</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">in the movement but in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">movement is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">a set of incoherent demands and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">let&#39;s see what sticks is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">yeah okay just a couple more here and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go into the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">uh next live stream</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">there is a time asymmetry in reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">with spurious arguments by answering</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">madness with reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">are we putting ourselves at a game</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">theoretic disadvantage maoists use dirty</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">tactics</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">will we be out competed by playing fair</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">um great question yeah i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">is a mechanism to win</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">by playing deceitfully i think it will</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">break down into</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">madness more quickly and that in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">the only option is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">to respond to the madness with reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">and then to try to amplify</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">the protection</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">for those who recognize the reason and</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">to be done but</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">it does not involve um coming up with</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just not going to work yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">so we&#39;re just gonna do the last two at</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">much don&#39;t know yet more and so no</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">thoughts yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">presumably we will have more at some</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">so many things in the cove 19 era are</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">okay uh i like the hashtag darkhorse duo</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">but worry that many sympathetic voters</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">would still vote for their preferred</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">lesser evil to avoid the spoiler effect</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">do you think a vote pairing app or</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">website could be useful in mitigating</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">well let me tell you yes i know you i</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">knew you went to get to that one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">we have put a lot of thought into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">spoiler effect</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">uh issue and what i can say is as we</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">reveal</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">the plan in all of its glory uh this</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">you will see that there is a fail-safe</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">built into the plan</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">so that it cannot act as a spoiler</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">this is one of two major objections that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">have and we have a structural fix so</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">on the one hand i don&#39;t think you need</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">an app to deal with that the failsafe</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:35.920" style="s2">does not require an app</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">that said i do believe there are things</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">that an app could be</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">very useful for in this plan and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">frankly building out the plan so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">the proof of concept can extend to other</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">offices not just the office of president</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">so anyway i&#39;m very keen on the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">sophisticated app that will form</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">the basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">retooling of our democratic process to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">make it work according to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">the values spelled out in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">constitution which i should point out</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">does not mention parties okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">starting at we hope the first question</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:17.280" style="s2">that came in</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">in the current live stream we have a</p>

<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">yes yes i think they can we&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">coming soon</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">all right yeah uh being wired this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">from echo</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">being wired to like the smell of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">genetically related to us</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">seems to give incentive to socialize and</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">is this still relevant and then a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">follow-up question if we all wear maoist</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">perfume while we get along</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">um so let&#39;s just say this is a tough</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">right there&#39;s a question about what</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">society we would like</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">and one thing that people advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">is a society in which we actually do</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">stop taking racial distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">seriously and we blend into each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">the problem is there may be genetic</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">that your genome doesn&#39;t prefer that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">which are not actually relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">your person and what it would want and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">then there may be reasons that your</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">genome doesn&#39;t want it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">um in some way costly so let me just say</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">you have different um things in tension</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">on the one hand you have attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">breeding with people who are closer to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">you in all probability and that does not</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">have to be genetic it can be transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">culturally as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">and then you have a force pulling you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">away from breeding with</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">people who are too close and then you</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">have another factor which i would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">is and again this can be kinetic it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">function culturally or a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">the two which is hybrid vigor</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">so to the extent that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">one has certain things that function</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">in one population and other things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">function very well in another population</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">a hybrid may carry the values that exist</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">in both those populations</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">to one individual so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">puzzle and i don&#39;t think we have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">understanding of all of the nuances here</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say we are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">being jerked around</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">by our genomes we are being jerked</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">around in our actual interests we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">being jerked around in genetic interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">that we should not honor and then we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">being pulled in directions that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">understand because they may</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">uh contain values that um we are unaware</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">so let&#39;s not oversimplify it is really i</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">guess what i&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">are we memeing ourselves into oblivion</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">yes what mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">next question what medic should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">stressed to self-correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.839" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">um i mean the problem stop it yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">the problem is we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">because memes which</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">came into existence with richard dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">chapter 11</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">of the self gene in 1976</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">that&#39;s where the concept came from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">concept was a scientific concept</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">until it became an internet concept that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">then got kind of trivialized by</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">what we all call memes which are cute</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:36.079" style="s2">gifs and things that have text</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">associated with them or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">and the problem is in some sense there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">a lot of stuff that actually at a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">technical level</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">is clearly memetic these podcasts are</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">clearly mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a whole landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">podcasts that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">trying to sort out difficult issues</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">uh you know in a long form so um</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">that is us struggling through a memetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">towards reason and it may be the answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.119" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">to the insanity that arises in a world</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">um you know hurling uh trivial memes at</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">so yes something in the pneumatic</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">landscape is probably the answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">good you&#39;re up next as well what are the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">primary very significant disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">that you and sam harris have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">um you know there are a few apparently</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">one are they growing well i think i</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">a lot of things uh trace themselves to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">few roots</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">one has to do with determinism and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">whether this could be a fully</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">deterministic universe</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">another one has to do with free will and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">the free will discussion is contingent</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">on my being</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">right about the uh the determinism</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">if it&#39;s a deterministic universe i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">even know what free will would mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">if it is a non-deterministic universe at</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">some level then free will is possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">sam says it isn&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">yeah so i mean there are philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">positions that allow for one without the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">it seems incoherent to me but i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.880" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen it written</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">yes you&#39;ve seen it written and if it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">in a deterministic universe i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">what that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s that and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">this question of pan psychism which i</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know where he falls out today</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">on pan psychism but pan psychism the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">idea that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">because it is um seemingly resistant to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">rigorous explanation by standard means</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">must therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">in some sense be written into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">material that the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">of which i find preposterous may even</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">predate matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">right so anyway i would say those are um</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">those are the biggies and the funny</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">in some sense i don&#39;t think almost</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">anything important depends on these</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">things because</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2">frankly sam he&#39;s very careful to argue</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">that regardless of whether or not he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">right you need to behave in an honorable</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">and ethical and moral way</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">right sam lives like a guy</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t uh believe in these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">and he would probably tell you that so</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">oh yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">so in any case i there there are some</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">disagreements they&#39;re probably worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">sorting out because these are actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">important philosophical questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">but probably nothing depends on it which</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">is why sam and i get along</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">in spite of our differences that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">uh this from holly mathnerd why is</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">transgender identity even without</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">celebrated but trans-racial identity is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:30.559" style="s2">considered an appalling appropriation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">oppression not your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">thank you holly uh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question well and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">we i&#39;ve now forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">the woman&#39;s name was it no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">we had it we had an academic famously</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">over making exactly remember who it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">it might have been duvall anyway</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">so somebody made this argument in an</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">academic paper</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">um i mean you know didn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">argument pro</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">or khan but basically said is this</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">analogous and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">a firestorm erupted so let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">the reason that we don&#39;t notice that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">inconsistency is because we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">completely given up on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">consistent</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">yeah consistency as a virtue yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">our people wolf is back yes our people</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">wolf is back now</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">wagging carrying a large donut around</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">off my chair</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:25.599" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s totally incoherent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.920" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">consistent and it and it reveals the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.599" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">uh of the of the field the scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">uh and uh if you could point that out to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">an individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">it reveals maybe not their hypocrisy but</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">if they don&#39;t think on it and get back</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">to you and say i</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">see that i have to accept both of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">or neither of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">as um in order to remain consistent</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">uh then it suggests very strongly that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">they are not working from first</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">principles but working from</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">received wisdom yep and if you can just</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">do a thought experiment here too</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s possible oh no no okay well</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">try not to get us in too much hot water</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">but it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">that a person could transition</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">from white to black so long as they took</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">up an aggressively</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to say pro-black so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">think this movement is pro-black but</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">an officially sanctioned pro-black</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">position but if you were to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">transitioning sean king style</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">to black and taking up a skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">position of the movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">it would not function which tells you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">something about where we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">that what is permitted is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">about logic at all</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">it&#39;s about um what you plan to do having</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">done so and um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">that&#39;s not how logic works right you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">will be required to adopt these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">if and only if uh you also agree with</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">this over here otherwise you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">prohibited from doing so yep</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">uh have you guys oh have you guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">considered any question submission</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">systems besides super chat i vote with</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">my wallet and i can&#39;t stand the thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">of youtube taking a 35</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">cut yeah it&#39;s egregious isn&#39;t it i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">software developer i would be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">build you a custom one</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">well kyle um let us see if we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">out how to be in touch with you because</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.280" style="s2">yeah so zach is saving that for us and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">uh that would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">that would be great because uh being</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">more free from youtube would be terrific</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">and obviously um if you guys are</p>

<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">glimmerings of hope</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">some places at some publishing houses</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">with imprint</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">imprints possibly trying to um</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">create a buffer for authors um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">know if any of that is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">children&#39;s literature</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">or why a literature and it also um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s not of course the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">that would be authors run into the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">thing you run into is the agencies</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">literary agencies</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">and when i went looking for literary</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">agencies</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:34.720" style="s2">boy three three and a half years ago for</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">uh science fiction i was amazed then</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">at how many code words how many woken</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">intersectionalist</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:42.559" style="s2">code words there were in almost every</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">agency that i looked at so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.559" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">it is i don&#39;t even know even if the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">publishers</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">even if some publishers get smart to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">this how do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:53.599" style="s2">do an end run around agents given that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">most publishers won&#39;t even look at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.599" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">proposal from you if you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">agent</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s the wrong question all</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:06.839" style="s2">the fact is you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">an ideology it is logically</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.839" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">incoherent what are the chances</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.520" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">that every university in the country</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">would find itself enthralled to it</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">there&#39;s zero there are lots of us who</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">know what&#39;s wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">so what happened power happened there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">something powerful enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">to take every university and turn it in</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">this direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">right that is going to be true for</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:32.799" style="s2">were it true that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">publication that resisted this</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.799" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">it would be wildly popular right because</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">people they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.359" style="s2">yet another vox they need something that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">speaks in a different voice</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.359" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">and so um the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">fact of the absence of the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:52.960" style="s2">view in some sort of standard form tells</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">you that what&#39;s really going on is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.960" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">something very very powerful that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">capable of taking every property and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">right that&#39;s what we&#39;re facing so in</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">looking for a strategy how in a world</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">where this seems to be very widespread</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">do you accomplish x the point is no if</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">you accomplish x then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.040" style="s2">become the thing that it has to go after</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">in order that nobody can accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.040" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">x so in some sense we have to fight this</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">um with a an understanding that it is in</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">a uh a spreading ideology</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">that infects everything a horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">and that the idea how do you how could</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">you construct a platform that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">have this happen if you did</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">they would have to find a way in and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:40.240" style="s2">they will so</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">um trying to navigate it as an</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.240" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">effectively hopeless you can leap off</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">into i mean this podcast is</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">an independent voice and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">independent voice because</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">um because the tools to simply put</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">something into the world and have you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">directly reach it um exist</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">but we still you know we&#39;re still you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">know at the whim of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:05.760" style="s2">youtube to some degree right and i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">going to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.760" end="01:00:09.359" style="s2">uh within the book publishing industry</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.359" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">being able to self-publish became a</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:16.400" style="s2">that has not nearly as much negative</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:18.880" style="s2">connotation</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.400" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">now as it did 30 years ago 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.880" end="01:00:25.040" style="s2">it was would have been impossible</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">really a hundred years ago or so um but</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.040" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">i think independent publishers are still</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:31.920" style="s2">basically dependent on amazon</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">right i think that that then is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">arbiter of whether or not you&#39;re woke</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">enough now</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">and i see for instance that and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">not a self-published book but</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">abigail schreier&#39;s new book uh which is</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s an extant</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">reputable publisher that&#39;s been around</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">for a while so it&#39;s not just her</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">fighting amazon but um still they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:14.319" style="s2">losing</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.319" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">and yet we&#39;re all still going through</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">some portal that does have an ability at</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:23.760" style="s2">any moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">to say actually no i don&#39;t actually like</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.760" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:29.040" style="s2">it&#39;s choke points is the problem it will</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">ultimately come down to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.040" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">google is a choke point amazon is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">choke point</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">your isp is a choke point the credit</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">cards are choke points</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:40.880" style="s2">and this thing is in all of those places</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">so it cannot resist now there is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.880" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">question about why</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:46.400" style="s2">a podcast like this is tolerated right</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.400" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">what we don&#39;t know is if you duplicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:58.079" style="s2">and you tried it if you didn&#39;t have um</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.960" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">our following and our friends the things</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.079" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">that we have accumulated in the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">since evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">blew up you might be able to uh drive us</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">extinct</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:09.359" style="s2">without anybody making a fuss and it may</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:12.319" style="s2">be that the thing that allows us to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.359" end="01:02:13.280" style="s2">what we say is the fact that the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">taking us off these platforms is too</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">high it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">it would put them in two awkward</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">positions so i don&#39;t know the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">i certainly do frequently feel twitter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">thumb on the scale i feel google&#39;s thumb</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">on the scale</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">and um there&#39;s no telling i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">the slate star codex example is a case</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">something the the coup went too far it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">went after a property that actually a</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">important people were paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:43.359" style="s2">to yeah and so now they&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">awkward situation on their hands</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.359" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">um but that you know do you want to live</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">in a world where the only people who can</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">true things are people for whom it</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:52.799" style="s2">becomes really awkward when you toss</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:55.280" style="s2">them off the platform or</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.799" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">docks them or you know put them through</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.280" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">a struggle session yeah you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">to live in that world you want to live</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">in a world where we are all protected</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">from struggle sessions because struggle</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">sessions are wrong</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll get through a couple more of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:09.680" style="s2">these um</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:11.359" style="s2">can we please address can we please</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:13.119" style="s2">address the gender gap in college</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">education and graduation rates</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">what does it mean for our nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">workforce and for family life</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">so the gender gap that the person is</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">referring to obviously is the inverse of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">one usually invoked</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">that we have um gosh i think it may be</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">closing in on 60 40.</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">60 of college</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:35.359" style="s2">actual undergrads and i think graduates</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">are now female</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.359" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">and the gap is growing and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">it is certainly it is skewed differently</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">into different</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">degrees across different disciplines but</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">it is real</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">this is something that christina hoff</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">summers has been on</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.640" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">for decades at this point i think it may</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">be something that we talked about with</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">her and peter bogosian on stage</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">when we were on stage with her here in</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">portland a couple years ago and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">um that&#39;s up on that&#39;s online we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">link to it here i think i think that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">talked about this a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">in that um in that event um</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">but what does it mean for the nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">workforce and for family life it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">to be deeply destructive of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got more men than women</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:24.240" style="s2">without college degrees going forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:25.760" style="s2">and in the past having a college degree</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.240" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">was the thing that you needed</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.760" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">to move into the middle class the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">college degrees are less and less</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">valuable now because</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">of what we&#39;ve already been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">with regard to what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">academy</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">but they still have this sort of badge</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:39.920" style="s2">of success</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">about them many women are going to only</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.920" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">looking for mates who have an equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">or higher</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">level of that kind of badge and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:51.440" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be greater competition</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">for men which is going to cause greater</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.440" end="01:04:54.880" style="s2">failure of families as men see that they</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">can choose</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.880" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">among the women who are valuing them</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s chaos across the board</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason to expect that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to think this is in</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">any way good just celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:11.839" style="s2">i feel like some people are celebrating</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">this but what is certainly happening</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.839" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">even if that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">um no one talks about it yeah i mean we</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">we have on a few occasions</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">but the only gender gaps that we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">allowed to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">are the ones in which women are are</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">still lagging</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">uh even even when all of the trend lines</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">look like um look like those</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">those gaps are going to even out very</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">soon there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">petty and deeply nihilistic about what</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">we are seeing and they just simply go</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">that which works and um</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">anyway yeah i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:55.119" style="s2">boy i i hope there&#39;s nothing to but</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">maybe there is something to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.119" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">that higher ed is becoming a cesspool of</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.799" style="s2">irrelevance</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">exactly as uh women are requiring more</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.799" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">and more power within it</p>

<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">competing warlord then</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">well that depends how you know we need</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">some different</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">autonomous zones each one will have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">have a little battle for</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:47.359" style="s2">warlord and then as they meet we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">out you know i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.359" end="01:06:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re looking i didn&#39;t hear you say it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:53.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think even you said it</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.760" end="01:06:55.839" style="s2">okay shouldn&#39;t marxism be treated the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.760" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">same way nazism is treated in academia</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.839" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:06:59.599" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t funding violent</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.000" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">revolutionaries be treated the same as</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.599" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">funding</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">terrorists and those assets seized</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:07.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t those two changes</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">end all of this no um</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.760" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">so first of all i hate this because i</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">defending communism</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">um i will make the same point that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">always gets me in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">which is that there is a critique</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">inside of marxism which is not so easy</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">to dismiss there is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:29.599" style="s2">plan which is crazy that we know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">work and i would argue that actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.599" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">somehow in this discussion we are</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">missing the central fact which is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">the world&#39;s most boring conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">which is about whether or not group</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:41.760" style="s2">selection is an important evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">force is the key to understanding why</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.760" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">marxism</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">when translated into communism does not</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">work so somehow we are going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.480" style="s2">get up to speed on</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">why this plan every time it evolves and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.480" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to come from marx</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:56.160" style="s2">you can have people reinvent the plan</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:57.599" style="s2">and decide hey wouldn&#39;t it be cool if we</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.160" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">all pointed in the same direction</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.599" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">redistributed everything that plan is</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:02.960" style="s2">not going to work</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">but um i tell you what i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.960" end="01:08:08.880" style="s2">something tantalizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:10.319" style="s2">the body is communist</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.880" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">the body is communist in the following</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.319" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">sense um from each</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">according to the human body everybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a political statement you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">making no this is an anatomical</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">physiological statement okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">okay go from each according to his</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">ability to each according to his need</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.719" end="01:08:26.319" style="s2">that&#39;s how the body works</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">right why does it work because all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.319" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">cells have the same genome</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">they have no reason to disagree over</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">this plan right so the point is altruism</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">is built into the way you structure it</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">why won&#39;t that work with people</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">because our genomes aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:40.799" style="s2">until your worst is not communist a tree</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:44.159" style="s2">is communist but a forest is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.799" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">correct correct so if you understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.159" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">then the point is listen you communists</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">you&#39;ve missed this important biological</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:51.040" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:52.239" style="s2">do you want to get us to all point in</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.040" end="01:08:54.159" style="s2">the same direction do you want</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.239" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">well-being to be widely distributed</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.159" end="01:08:58.880" style="s2">the answer to how you do that is through</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">enlightened self-interest and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.880" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">cooperation it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:03.839" style="s2">it is possible to build that system but</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">it will not be communist that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.839" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">you will get there that thing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">unstable</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">and the reason that you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.799" end="01:09:12.560" style="s2">gulags and other forms of oppression</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">traveling in tandem with this mode is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">failure of it to work forces you to</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">re-incentivize things for people in</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">other words what causes people to behave</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">in a communist way</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">is the threat of death or being</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">imprisoned and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.199" end="01:09:28.319" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to go down this road we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:31.199" style="s2">discovered it already</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.319" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">many times over let&#39;s not rediscover it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.199" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">do you want to redistribute</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">opportunity i&#39;m all for redistributing</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">opportunity right but if you get stuck</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">in the redistributing wealth</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">conversation you&#39;re never going to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:43.040" style="s2">right opportunity should be broadly</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">distributed any honest capitalist should</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.040" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">right they want opportunity broadly</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">distributed if they&#39;re honest</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:50.719" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way the maximum</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">amount of good stuff gets done</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.719" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">right when you have people sidelined</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">people who have incredible capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">they&#39;re sidelined cleaning somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">toilet</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:09:59.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a waste that&#39;s somebody who might</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">have invented something awesome who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.840" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">doing something</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">that you know a robot should do right so</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">distributing opportunity broadly great</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:09.760" style="s2">but let&#39;s build it on a foundation that</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">makes some sense and that involves</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.760" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">known things right cooperation that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">based on enlightened self-interest</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:17.920" style="s2">so one of the key misunderstandings then</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">uh that the body be it a human body or a</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">tree&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">body or whatever is effectively</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">communist because</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">all of the cells and systems in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">body have shared</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">fate this is the concept um that this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">maybe one of the concepts</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">i find most important from evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:39.120" style="s2">biology that they have shared fate</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.280" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">whereas the trees in a forest have</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.120" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">some shared fate but not wholly shared</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">fate just</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:46.080" style="s2">as the people in a village or a town or</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">a nation</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:53.440" style="s2">um cannot have fully shared fate whereas</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:56.560" style="s2">we all of us on the planet do</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.440" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">yeah right so so we have we have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">planetary shared fate but that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">big to uh to regulate at the same kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">of level that we need regulation and</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">good governance and effective governance</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">at the more local scale</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:11.360" style="s2">but bodies can act individual human</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">bodies</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.360" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">are effectively communist in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:17.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">that corporations and</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.440" end="01:11:21.920" style="s2">towns cannot be because there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.600" style="s2">incomplete shared fate</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.920" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">i want to add something to the mix</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.600" end="01:11:26.239" style="s2">shared fate is very important but</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:28.400" style="s2">frankly i&#39;d argue</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.239" end="01:11:29.520" style="s2">nationally we have shared fate right if</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.400" end="01:11:32.159" style="s2">we wreck the nation</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.520" end="01:11:32.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be collectively screwed</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.159" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.880" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">there are two things that work in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">body&#39;s favor</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:41.440" style="s2">in establishing corporal communism or</p>

<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">you would call it one is the shared fate</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:50.239" style="s2">um and the other is the complete absence</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:53.280" style="s2">of conflicts of interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.239" end="01:11:54.960" style="s2">i mean i i put that under shared fate</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.280" end="01:11:56.640" style="s2">they&#39;re distinct right you can put a</p>

<p begin="01:11:56.640" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">of interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">in a rowboat and they might still have</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:08.159" style="s2">goes under right but the body</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">by having a genome that accounts for</p>

<p begin="01:12:15.840" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">because it would be suicidal not to and</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:21.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:22.640" style="s2">the notable exception of course being</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.120" end="01:12:25.199" style="s2">cancer well and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">cancer is basically i won&#39;t say this in</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.199" end="01:12:28.239" style="s2">every case because there are cancers</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">that are contagious and things but in</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:30.640" style="s2">general cancer if it functions the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">we think it does</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">is incoherent it&#39;s like renegade cells</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:36.159" style="s2">that frankly don&#39;t have an interest in</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">being renegade because they create</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.159" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">a tumor that yes it grows but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:42.480" style="s2">dead end</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">so um so yes the body has an</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.480" end="01:12:45.120" style="s2">overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:46.960" style="s2">reason i mean you know the body</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.120" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">cooperates to get the gonads into a</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:49.600" style="s2">position that they can actually produce</p>

<p begin="01:12:49.600" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">next generation that&#39;s that&#39;s the game</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">but they have every reason</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">your liver doesn&#39;t want to freeze out</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">your eyes it wants your eyes to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:02.960" style="s2">everything they need to make them work</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:05.600" style="s2">great so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.960" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">yes yep that&#39;s that&#39;s the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.600" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been consistently annoyingly</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:15.199" style="s2">sharing the evergreen dock by mike nena</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">but next steps will the idw band get</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.199" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">back together</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:18.880" style="s2">we need leaders but we also need</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">direction on how we can best support</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.880" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">this movement on our own</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:25.199" style="s2">didn&#39;t your brother say he was getting</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">the band back together i believe i</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.199" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">retweeted that very thing yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">sounded like he was getting the band</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">back together</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:32.080" style="s2">um i&#39;m looking forward to it as i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">said elsewhere i</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.080" end="01:13:37.440" style="s2">miss idw i think idw was</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">doing very important work i think it</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.440" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">needed to evolve into a next</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">phase and maybe it has and it just</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:46.800" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:49.760" style="s2">correctly understood but i do think uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.800" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">boy it&#39;s time we&#39;re we&#39;re in such</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.760" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">jeopardy</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">and what we really need are people who</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:54.640" style="s2">can say the difficult things and live to</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:54.960" style="s2">tell the tale and demonstrate it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.640" end="01:13:56.880" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.960" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">it needs to spread the ability to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">that needs to spread yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">i first learned a view on joe rogan</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">after our kids in catholic school</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">in grade eight homework asking how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">decolonize the canadian military</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">and grade four being told</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:15.760" style="s2">boys have periods too i have watched and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.760" end="01:14:22.320" style="s2">all of jordan peterson eric brett etc</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.199" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">thank you to very much so there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.320" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">question there but</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:29.360" style="s2">um yeah decolonizing the canadian</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">military and in grade four that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.360" end="01:14:32.239" style="s2">like a nine-year-old an eight-year-old</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:34.960" style="s2">nine-year-old being told that boys have</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.239" end="01:14:34.960" style="s2">periods too</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:39.040" style="s2">hopefully hopefully what happens is all</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.000" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">this garbage</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.040" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">is gonna backfire because even kids that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">young are going to begin to detect that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:47.120" style="s2">the adults who are talking to them have</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">no goddamn concept what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.120" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">but that&#39;s i mean at best then we end up</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">with an entire generation</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:57.520" style="s2">of uh traumatized children who never had</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:14:59.520" style="s2">effective adults in their lives</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.520" end="01:15:00.719" style="s2">i mean look and you know and this this</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.520" end="01:15:03.199" style="s2">in catholic school</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.719" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna we expect other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.199" end="01:15:05.840" style="s2">ideology perhaps to be percolating</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:08.880" style="s2">through catholic schools</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.840" end="01:15:10.239" style="s2">not this okay here&#39;s the thing i think</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.880" end="01:15:12.640" style="s2">it is a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.239" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">to imagine that somehow we&#39;re shooting</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">for a world in which children are not</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:18.880" style="s2">traumatized</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:21.120" style="s2">we&#39;re all traumatized okay we are losing</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.880" end="01:15:24.800" style="s2">the thread of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:28.719" style="s2">and the point is look trauma</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.800" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">in isolation is bad trauma gives rise</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.719" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:35.280" style="s2">to the ability to do the extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:36.960" style="s2">the unusual the unexpected and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.280" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">if we could start thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.960" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">fact that modernity</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">is actually traumatizing every child can</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">turn that trauma into something valuable</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:47.120" style="s2">can we turn it into independence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.120" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2">into a high capacity i mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:53.600" style="s2">you know the way we joke with our kids</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.600" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">trained them to spot right</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:00.719" style="s2">right like it&#39;s every day it&#39;s a 24 hour</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:03.360" style="s2">a day training</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.719" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">they know they know how to spot</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">and really actually some high quality</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.640" end="01:16:07.679" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">but the point is not so high quality oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.679" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:16.719" style="s2">you got to mix it up right you don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:20.159" style="s2">in any case somehow we need</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.719" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">those people who get it to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:23.360" style="s2">understand that they have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">responsibility to convey</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:26.960" style="s2">to indicate to kids they encounter hey</p>

<p begin="01:16:26.960" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">you may be hearing some it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">be coming from surprising places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">not always in</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">advertisement sometimes you know it may</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">be your</p>

<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:38.960" style="s2">the teachers who really know what</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about because for one</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.960" end="01:16:41.040" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.440" end="01:16:42.400" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who will entertain your</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">questions and give you back an answer</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.400" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">that sounds like an answer</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:48.159" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way to recognize a good</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.040" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">teacher if your teacher punishes you for</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.159" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">asking questions</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:52.960" style="s2">if they spout back something that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">like nonsense and you can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.960" end="01:16:55.840" style="s2">what they said</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:57.440" style="s2">that might not be the best teacher</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.840" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.440" end="01:17:03.600" style="s2">okay let&#39;s let&#39;s get one more question</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">we get a couple of thank yous we have a</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:11.760" style="s2">was thinking stagecoach</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.840" end="01:17:17.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:21.920" style="s2">okay let&#39;s do uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">two more here do you think since a lot</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:28.719" style="s2">of this started in literature that</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">starting with how we view stories</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.719" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">might fix it i&#39;m not sure it started in</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">literature i think it started in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">pseudo scholarship</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">but certainly it&#39;s taken over a fair bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">of literature and i do</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:46.560" style="s2">think that taking back</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.280" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">myth and narrative and um</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.560" end="01:17:53.760" style="s2">generating narratives that we can</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.920" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">get behind uh will be an important</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.760" end="01:17:56.719" style="s2">part of this that we don&#39;t but one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">the things we&#39;ll probably talk about</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.719" end="01:17:59.600" style="s2">next time</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll just allude to a little bit here is</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:04.560" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:06.400" style="s2">one of one of the reasons that we in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.560" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">quotes are at disadvantage</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.400" end="01:18:11.679" style="s2">um is that there seem to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">compelling narratives in the form of</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.679" end="01:18:15.760" style="s2">you know viscerally compelling anecdotes</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:18.080" style="s2">on the other side and for the most part</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">the rejoinders that make sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.080" end="01:18:24.800" style="s2">are in fact these dispassionate</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">careful statistics based on actually at</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.800" end="01:18:28.239" style="s2">the population level</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:30.159" style="s2">this is what is happening and uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:32.159" style="s2">statistics are never going to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.159" end="01:18:34.080" style="s2">a good rejoinder to a good story you</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.159" end="01:18:35.760" style="s2">know humans humans operate emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.080" end="01:18:38.719" style="s2">at the level of stories so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:40.880" style="s2">have good stories that we can tell</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.719" end="01:18:43.440" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to take a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.880" end="01:18:45.040" style="s2">different tack i i agree that this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.440" end="01:18:46.480" style="s2">fundamentally important and you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.040" end="01:18:48.880" style="s2">pointed to the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.480" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">high quality narrative many times i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.880" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">going to argue that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.159" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">failure of narrative is one in a cluster</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.520" end="01:18:58.400" style="s2">of failures</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">that are crippling our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.400" end="01:19:02.320" style="s2">to be decent to each other and to move</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.159" end="01:19:05.440" style="s2">forward that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:06.480" style="s2">junk version of everything right we are</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.440" end="01:19:09.679" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.480" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">induced into junk narrative</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.679" end="01:19:12.800" style="s2">because we think that the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">narrative is entertainment</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.800" end="01:19:15.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not arguing that you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">entertained by narrative i hope you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.520" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">but that&#39;s not its purpose</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:22.719" style="s2">right we are being induced into a junk</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:25.120" style="s2">version of sex because we are told</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.719" end="01:19:26.880" style="s2">that the purpose of sex is basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.120" end="01:19:28.960" style="s2">getting off</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.880" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">right i hope you get off but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:32.480" style="s2">the purpose of sex</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">right the purpose of sex has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.480" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">with uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">bonding right we are told that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:44.880" style="s2">drugs is uh a thrill to pass the time</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:46.560" style="s2">right escape nope these are very serious</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.880" end="01:19:47.760" style="s2">compounds that tap into the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.560" end="01:19:49.760" style="s2">parts of your mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.760" end="01:19:50.800" style="s2">and the most important things are also</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.760" end="01:19:52.560" style="s2">often fun</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.800" end="01:19:54.239" style="s2">so right when you say serious just just</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.560" end="01:19:55.840" style="s2">so you&#39;re not misunderstood here right</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.239" end="01:19:57.280" style="s2">when you say serious you don&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.840" end="01:19:59.040" style="s2">going to be hard work and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.280" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">feel gray and you&#39;re not going to enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.040" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">right no no the point is the fun is</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:05.440" style="s2">nature&#39;s little reward to get you to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:07.600" style="s2">the work</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.440" end="01:20:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing the work is rewarding</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.600" end="01:20:11.199" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.880" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the reward isn&#39;t the point</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.199" end="01:20:14.560" style="s2">the word reward is the thing that gets</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:15.840" style="s2">you to do the work the point is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.560" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">product of the work</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.840" end="01:20:20.639" style="s2">and you know music again we think that</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:22.239" style="s2">the purpose is to entertain us</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.639" end="01:20:23.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t even realize that we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.239" end="01:20:24.800" style="s2">track of the fact that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.920" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">supposed to have</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.800" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">your own music in your ears and</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:28.719" style="s2">everybody is supposed to be able to pick</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:30.960" style="s2">the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.719" end="01:20:32.480" style="s2">you know tickles their mind just so we</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.960" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">are also supposed to have a shared</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.480" end="01:20:34.719" style="s2">musical</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.120" end="01:20:36.159" style="s2">supposed to be bringing us together and</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.719" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">not driving us further apart</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.159" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">not just bring us together but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:41.280" style="s2">supposed to be in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:43.280" style="s2">synchronizing the way we think around</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:44.560" style="s2">the same linguistic structures around</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.280" end="01:20:45.920" style="s2">the same melodies</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.560" end="01:20:47.440" style="s2">and that those are powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:48.560" style="s2">important forces that we just unhooked</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.440" end="01:20:49.760" style="s2">not even thinking about what we were</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.560" end="01:20:53.679" style="s2">doing and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.760" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">um you know you got music drugs sex</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:20:57.199" style="s2">all the important stuff we&#39;ve been given</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:20:58.960" style="s2">a junk version</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.199" end="01:21:00.320" style="s2">and we need we need a narrative we need</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.960" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">to resurrect</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.320" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">the functional version and the product</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.840" end="01:21:07.520" style="s2">of doing so would be a great deal more</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">satisfaction we are pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.520" end="01:21:09.920" style="s2">satisfaction</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:13.360" style="s2">directly and we are getting less and</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.920" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">less of it and pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.360" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">a higher quality interaction with each</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.120" style="s2">other over these things would have</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">exactly the opposite impact and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.120" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">um it couldn&#39;t possibly be more</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">one more question thank you guys your</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:29.760" style="s2">perspectives have changed my mind in</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:31.760" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.760" end="01:21:33.040" style="s2">so do you think life will ever go back</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.760" end="01:21:35.040" style="s2">to what we knew</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.040" end="01:21:37.600" style="s2">or should i start to adopt a new normal</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.040" end="01:21:39.440" style="s2">as much as i hate that term</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.600" end="01:21:41.520" style="s2">yeah the old normal&#39;s done i think we</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">know that for sure yeah it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.520" end="01:21:45.840" style="s2">to imagine we go back</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">um even if things formally went back to</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.840" end="01:21:49.280" style="s2">allowing you to interact the way you</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:50.719" style="s2">once did i think we&#39;re all a bit rattled</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.280" end="01:21:54.639" style="s2">at what we&#39;ve now seen</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.719" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen uh we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.639" end="01:21:58.639" style="s2">a threat to our way of life and this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">true no matter who you are no matter</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.639" end="01:22:02.400" style="s2">which side of this divide you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen a threat to our way of life</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.400" end="01:22:06.080" style="s2">we have seen people</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.840" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">open up possibilities that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.080" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">realize were</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:12.639" style="s2">near at hand and we&#39;ve also seen that</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">things can sneak up on us</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.639" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">covet 19 um i</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">increasingly believe is a self-inflicted</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">wound</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:22.960" style="s2">but to the extent that a self-inflicted</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">wound can</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.960" end="01:22:28.639" style="s2">emerge from some place half a world away</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">and you know bring us to our knees we</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.639" end="01:22:30.560" style="s2">should have been preparing for that all</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:32.639" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.560" end="01:22:34.159" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a secret that it could happen</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.639" end="01:22:35.440" style="s2">and the fact that we didn&#39;t and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:37.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s done this to us and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:38.800" style="s2">that it may have unleashed the social</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.040" end="01:22:40.400" style="s2">unrest all of these</p>
