<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:47.239" style="s2">little bit more of a backseat to listen</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">a lot to say on this subject um I get a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:02.340" style="s2">ton of information from YouTube I get I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2">think that&#39;s the majority of the way I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.340" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2">spend my my information gathering</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.979" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">podcasts on YouTube essentially um you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">know if I want to dig deeper I&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">I&#39;ll check some of the you know some</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">news sites BBC USA Today CNN al-jazeera</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">sometimes just to see if I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">missing something important like</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:41.909" style="s2">breaking news wise um but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">definitely secondary from getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.909" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">information from podcasts on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">then it shows like John Oliver I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">watch that and I think that&#39;s do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">know and then I&#39;m on Facebook a bit too</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">so what people are throwing around there</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">try not to do um the echo chamber thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">you know people I like the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">do have a variety of friends and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">a good thing um that&#39;s my current</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">situation that&#39;s what I currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">observe going on in my life I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.770" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">thought enough about it to know how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">what I would do to make it different</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">there was the one the Wikipedia folks</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">started that network for what is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the Wikipedia News Network and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">you can create an account and you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">post news stories but you can edit the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">title so you make the title of the news</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">story more accurate so if you are on</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:53.250" style="s2">that social network and all it is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">news and you&#39;re scrolling through news</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:02:58.019" style="s2">stories and it&#39;s another categorized and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">you can dig into like the topics that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.019" end="00:03:03.269" style="s2">you want to follow but if I post a news</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.049" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">story on there I have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.269" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">just totally change the title to make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">more accurate but it&#39;s Wikipedia so if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">post if someone else can change it you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">know and it&#39;s supposed to hone in on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">truth I can&#39;t remember the name of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.060" end="00:03:22.019" style="s2">I&#39;ll look it up right now and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">that&#39;s all I got I can go next I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.019" end="00:03:26.510" style="s2">never heard of that before</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:30.359" style="s2">I&#39;ve definitely heard of Wikipedia so</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.510" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">I&#39;ll look right now here yeah for me I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.359" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">get less about my news sources I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">less news sources so kind of just have</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">put up blinders to what&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:40.109" style="s2">going on because I feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:41.459" style="s2">only so much I can take in but I watched</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.590" end="00:04:09.560" style="s2">designed for entertainment instead of</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.169" end="00:06:04.169" style="s2">blocked everyone who not blocked I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:05.789" style="s2">unfollowed everyone who tends to be low</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.169" end="00:06:10.139" style="s2">quality information sources and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.789" end="00:06:11.910" style="s2">apparently that was most everyone so so</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.139" end="00:06:14.940" style="s2">I&#39;m actually I&#39;m kind of way out of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.910" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">feel-good stories and then here&#39;s some</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:30.599" style="s2">my life it&#39;s just the most entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.169" end="00:06:34.680" style="s2">- for people to watch as opposed to</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.680" end="00:06:37.950" style="s2">really found a solution for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.690" style="s2">although I guess really looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.950" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:47.640" style="s2">that that is important I mean what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.050" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">what&#39;s really important to me is is you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.640" end="00:06:51.150" style="s2">know what&#39;s happening in the industry I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:06:55.020" style="s2">work in and in the areas that I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.150" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">interest so like regular news is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.020" end="00:06:59.040" style="s2">important it&#39;s good to know what your</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">government is up to so it&#39;d be it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.040" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">nice if I had a reliable source of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:05.820" style="s2">but you know every news source you go to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:10.220" style="s2">is is coming from a slant and I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.820" end="00:07:12.390" style="s2">don&#39;t have the time or the energy to to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.220" end="00:07:13.620" style="s2">disambiguate where they&#39;re slanting</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.390" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">where they&#39;re inaccurate and where</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.620" end="00:07:22.350" style="s2">they&#39;re doing all that all on my own but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:25.230" style="s2">I haven&#39;t Roy I haven&#39;t really curated</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.350" end="00:07:28.470" style="s2">that that news those news sources yet to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.230" end="00:07:31.110" style="s2">make sure I hon things in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">world in the in my industry it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.110" end="00:07:38.100" style="s2">easier so I&#39;ve kind of curated there</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:40.830" style="s2">yeah and then so yeah I&#39;d like to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:46.350" style="s2">know I started my project reason score</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.830" end="00:07:49.040" style="s2">because there is such it&#39;s so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.350" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">determine the actual quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.040" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">maybe the way to say it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.690" end="00:07:57.630" style="s2">proximity of that information to actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:08:01.560" style="s2">reality is something that&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.630" end="00:08:03.660" style="s2">determine so I decided I wanted to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.560" end="00:08:07.340" style="s2">that easier and you know almost ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.660" end="00:08:09.600" style="s2">years later I meant further on it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.340" end="00:08:10.740" style="s2">don&#39;t want to dive in too much of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.600" end="00:08:14.700" style="s2">unless it comes up in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.740" end="00:08:16.020" style="s2">naturally so yeah so I&#39;ve pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.700" end="00:08:17.370" style="s2">blocked everything out I mean I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.020" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">Twitter and Facebook but those are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.370" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">curated feeds of mostly my industry and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:26.040" style="s2">stuff and then a couple of people that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:28.230" style="s2">follow and still like you know good half</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.040" end="00:08:29.850" style="s2">the content I don&#39;t care about I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.230" end="00:08:31.530" style="s2">would be nice I guess we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.850" end="00:08:38.340" style="s2">this later but it&#39;d be nice to have more</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.530" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">control over what I see so yeah so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.340" end="00:08:44.950" style="s2">get into that later part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:50.920" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty much me so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.950" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">I guess I&#39;ll go quick I just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.920" end="00:08:56.380" style="s2">like you guys I try to check out a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:58.510" style="s2">variety of different media types so I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.380" end="00:09:00.580" style="s2">watch some mainstream news and I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.510" end="00:09:03.340" style="s2">to Democracy Now and a lot of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.580" end="00:09:05.800" style="s2">just really trying to make my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.340" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">choices and look at each one from their</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.800" end="00:09:09.670" style="s2">angle and be like okay they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:14.130" style="s2">push something how do I feel about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.670" end="00:09:14.130" style="s2">just kind of neutralize what I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:22.540" style="s2">is I can go next</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.140" end="00:09:24.340" style="s2">so for actually watching the news I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.540" end="00:09:26.230" style="s2">don&#39;t watch the news for news purposes</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.340" end="00:09:28.810" style="s2">all that much anymore mostly because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.230" end="00:09:30.310" style="s2">don&#39;t trust almost anyone I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.810" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">watch it kind of as a spectator I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.310" end="00:09:34.030" style="s2">intentionally did not unfollow or</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.230" end="00:09:36.280" style="s2">unfriend all the people posting that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.030" end="00:09:37.750" style="s2">stuff on Facebook I like to see what</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.280" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">they post and I had to see well you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.750" end="00:09:41.650" style="s2">how people counter it I also like to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:43.780" style="s2">what people on the opposite end of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.650" end="00:09:46.090" style="s2">spectrum post and how different those</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.780" end="00:09:48.700" style="s2">two things are and then when I attend it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.090" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">to to dig deep is when there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:52.630" style="s2">especially interesting like the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.760" style="s2">groups just really don&#39;t agree on some</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.630" end="00:09:57.220" style="s2">key information and then they go and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.760" end="00:10:00.760" style="s2">poke around and see like what it</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.220" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">actually seems is it is going on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.760" end="00:10:05.340" style="s2">of the times it&#39;s incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">to find information that I&#39;m like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.340" end="00:10:09.280" style="s2">that seems trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">I now have made a choice on what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.280" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">good good going on that is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">rare but yeah that I tend to like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">comedy news sources that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">still take those with a grain of salt</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">too because it&#39;s still often try to push</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:33.550" style="s2">a narrative but still funny too should</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:35.770" style="s2">you want to share what you do for news</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.550" end="00:10:38.620" style="s2">or what you think is good and bad about</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.770" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">the space right now well there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.620" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">of bad things about the news right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">sorry information and I found</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.920" end="00:11:05.370" style="s2">all babies interrupting zooms and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:09.209" style="s2">streams since well long before they</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.370" end="00:11:11.130" style="s2">existed I can do a second thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.209" end="00:11:15.959" style="s2">something else came to mind that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.130" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">noticed so as someone that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.959" end="00:11:21.300" style="s2">in journalism you know I think we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:26.550" style="s2">need journalism you know I have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.300" end="00:11:29.639" style="s2">background in that but I know well it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.550" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">seems it appears that that industry is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.639" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">just struggling as a whole like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:37.170" style="s2">why I like the long-form YouTube things</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2">where it seems like you know people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.170" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">really share nuanced opinions and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:50.670" style="s2">whatnot what sometimes I guess baffles</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">me is some folks will post articles I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.670" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">see on my social media to sites that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">have subscriber paywalls and I can read</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.600" style="s2">like the first two paragraphs and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:05.820" style="s2">I&#39;m just left with this feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.600" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">gosh if this is important information</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.820" end="00:12:12.420" style="s2">like people should be able to know about</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">it and I you know but if people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.420" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">providing a good service</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.890" end="00:12:21.390" style="s2">she knows should they be compensated</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.160" end="00:12:24.269" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know how to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.390" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">problem but sometimes I&#39;m like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.269" end="00:12:28.170" style="s2">I&#39;ll see something that looks really</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:31.320" style="s2">important and I&#39;m like should I be</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.170" end="00:12:33.709" style="s2">paying $5.99 a month for this I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.320" end="00:12:37.260" style="s2">know like I don&#39;t know how to value it</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.709" end="00:12:38.220" style="s2">but if this is important for being on</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.260" end="00:12:40.680" style="s2">planet Earth</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.220" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">why are we pay walling important</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.680" end="00:12:46.769" style="s2">information I have no clue that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.209" style="s2">something else I notice yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.769" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important point I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.209" end="00:12:52.620" style="s2">all of the the the trust issues are just</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">not all of them but a great number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.620" end="00:12:57.269" style="s2">the ones that came to light we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:12:59.550" style="s2">because as a society we decided that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.269" end="00:13:00.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t need to pay for news anymore we</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.550" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">don&#39;t need you know newspapers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.839" end="00:13:06.180" style="s2">online it it&#39;s free forever now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:07.649" style="s2">never paying for foreigners again is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:10.230" style="s2">everyone&#39;s but I think enough people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.649" end="00:13:11.579" style="s2">standpoint that then news organizations</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.230" end="00:13:12.740" style="s2">had to scramble to figure out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.579" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">stay in business and some</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.740" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t and then some did but they either</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">had to you know go sketchy with</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:19.490" style="s2">clickbait headlines and heavy</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.450" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">advertising or they had to sell you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.490" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">to Jeff Bezos or or somebody who now</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:24.830" style="s2">owns a bunch of different news</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">organizations and we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.830" end="00:13:30.200" style="s2">that same poll you know of just like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.930" style="s2">government legislation and things sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.200" end="00:13:34.790" style="s2">of skewing it in a favor the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.930" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">own the media surprisingly enough have</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.790" end="00:13:40.370" style="s2">the media skewed in that favor yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.300" end="00:13:41.630" style="s2">like some of the solutions that people</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.370" end="00:13:45.010" style="s2">are working on in that space that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.630" end="00:13:47.209" style="s2">haven&#39;t caught on like you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:52.310" style="s2">microtransactions so maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.209" end="00:13:54.230" style="s2">paying $5.99 a month which anyways that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.310" end="00:13:55.970" style="s2">you know if I read an article then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.230" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">don&#39;t you know charge like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.970" end="00:14:01.220" style="s2">cents or something like that to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:04.010" style="s2">account I would love something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.220" end="00:14:08.330" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s been and so that&#39;s meant</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:41.720" style="s2">can even contradict yourself I&#39;m sure I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">will so anyone who would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.720" end="00:15:49.389" style="s2">that sure closer</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:52.430" style="s2">I wanted two of the things is on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.389" end="00:15:55.129" style="s2">funding one of the big things that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.430" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">think they do in the UK is with our TV</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.129" end="00:16:00.410" style="s2">licences and then a lot or possibly all</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.360" style="s2">of that money goes to the BBC and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.410" end="00:16:04.670" style="s2">that ends up being a form of income</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">that&#39;s reliable that from what I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">tell isn&#39;t as dependent on like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">government being happy with you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">which is one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">dangerous like in Canada where we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">the CBC but the government can control</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">how much money we actually give them and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.319" style="s2">so if it&#39;s an organization so if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:23.029" style="s2">government maybe doesn&#39;t like what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.319" end="00:16:25.399" style="s2">news is saying about them they can then</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.029" end="00:16:27.649" style="s2">start to cut funding which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.399" end="00:16:30.230" style="s2">defeats the purpose and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.649" end="00:16:33.980" style="s2">case so something similar to - to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:37.309" style="s2">BBC where it&#39;s tax basically but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.980" end="00:16:39.350" style="s2">not through the government as far as</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.309" end="00:16:41.059" style="s2">words like if they wanted to change the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.350" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">tax or who it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.059" end="00:16:45.290" style="s2">they would probably in being like an</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:46.939" style="s2">election where were saying hey how much</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.290" end="00:16:48.709" style="s2">did do the people think that these news</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.939" end="00:16:50.889" style="s2">organizations should get who should get</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.709" end="00:16:53.029" style="s2">it and the government can&#39;t just touch</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.889" end="00:17:00.019" style="s2">anything to do with that tax without</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.029" end="00:17:04.610" style="s2">massive public approval yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.019" end="00:17:06.949" style="s2">or redone there Adrian oh yeah yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.610" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">have kind of concerns about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.949" end="00:17:12.909" style="s2">don&#39;t have a better solution what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.409" end="00:17:16.339" style="s2">would like to see is is being able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.909" end="00:17:18.140" style="s2">subscribe to specific topics and be able</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.339" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">to filter my news so I&#39;d like to be able</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.140" end="00:17:22.429" style="s2">to ask an AI or I mean I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:24.980" style="s2">about black box a eyes but something</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.429" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">where you can you can set up rules on on</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.980" end="00:17:30.200" style="s2">what content you want to receive but</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:33.320" style="s2">then I also you know if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.200" end="00:17:35.870" style="s2">posting an article ideally all of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.320" end="00:17:37.429" style="s2">source content should be available like</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.870" end="00:17:39.020" style="s2">if they talked on the phone or send an</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.429" end="00:17:39.890" style="s2">email to that person why are those</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.020" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2">recordings</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.890" end="00:17:44.900" style="s2">fully available right they you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.710" end="00:17:46.750" style="s2">have to read it in the article but give</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.900" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">me a link to go to that source stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.750" end="00:17:53.920" style="s2">just some general kind of guidance on</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:56.660" style="s2">how journalism happens in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.920" end="00:17:58.190" style="s2">actual storing of content is not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.660" end="00:18:01.010" style="s2">expensive thing the expensive thing as</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.190" end="00:18:03.140" style="s2">the attention in the quality of time and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.010" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">then yeah some sort of kind of better</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.140" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">feedback mechanism than comments and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:10.700" style="s2">stuff so that as the information changes</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">or as you can get more input because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.700" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">think a lot of time the reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:18.260" style="s2">have such a divisive environment is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:22.310" style="s2">the content that&#39;s created is slanted</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.260" end="00:18:25.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.310" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">knowledge of the other group is in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.160" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">and not that I think everything needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:31.700" style="s2">be like completely balanced between the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:35.900" style="s2">two sides but if we can fully represent</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.700" end="00:18:39.290" style="s2">the intent of both sides then I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.900" end="00:18:40.340" style="s2">that that news could be trusted much</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.290" end="00:18:42.440" style="s2">better because you can see everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.340" end="00:18:43.730" style="s2">but then of course it&#39;s a lot of data</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.440" end="00:18:47.500" style="s2">and you have to figure out how summarize</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.730" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">it which is part of what I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.500" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">so yeah so being able to control what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:55.910" style="s2">content I see to better extent having it</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">be able to go as deep as I want into</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.910" end="00:19:00.170" style="s2">that content rather than have it having</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:02.780" style="s2">just the final published product and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">then kind of a feedback mechanism so it</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.780" end="00:19:10.670" style="s2">grows and improves would be something</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:13.430" style="s2">unlike having a medium grade I I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.670" end="00:19:15.710" style="s2">be very useful something like in science</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.430" end="00:19:18.620" style="s2">fiction literature II you can have</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.710" end="00:19:19.790" style="s2">something called a butler which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.620" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">like add you know in your background</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.790" end="00:19:25.060" style="s2">just sifting through the news and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">presenting you with relevant data and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.060" end="00:19:35.900" style="s2">also able to get both points of view</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:41.930" style="s2">like for every fact you have you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.900" end="00:19:44.360" style="s2">have multiple views on we know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.930" end="00:19:46.760" style="s2">happened like the president said this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.360" end="00:19:51.170" style="s2">and this but then interpretations there</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.760" end="00:19:53.890" style="s2">are lots of and left side right side</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.170" end="00:19:56.860" style="s2">they all have the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.890" end="00:19:59.770" style="s2">they have the same fact but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.860" end="00:20:03.549" style="s2">interpreted in totally different way so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.770" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">what I found useful also basically for</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.549" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">each piece of news to read the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:15.700" style="s2">left and well maybe not extreme because</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:18.429" style="s2">extreme is not very useful but left and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.700" end="00:20:21.910" style="s2">right sources and that interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.429" end="00:20:25.720" style="s2">and then interpolate from that more or</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.910" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">less mmm I know what happened but I then</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.720" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">know why something happened and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:39.040" style="s2">usually can see how it is connected so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">like everything else so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.040" end="00:20:43.330" style="s2">something that could do it for me would</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:46.360" style="s2">be very useful because of these days it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.330" end="00:20:49.000" style="s2">seems there is no unbiased source of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.360" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2">information anymore if you already</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.000" end="00:20:53.530" style="s2">looked at like all sides calm or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">I think there&#39;s two or three projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.530" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">that try and give you a single article</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.470" end="00:21:03.900" style="s2">written by multiple or single topic</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:09.130" style="s2">covered by multiple news sources that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.900" end="00:21:10.540" style="s2">pretty cool all sides calm I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.130" end="00:21:12.309" style="s2">like when I&#39;ll put it in the description</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.540" end="00:21:14.110" style="s2">for the YouTube one after if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.309" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">also the one that Daniel had suggested</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.110" end="00:21:19.210" style="s2">that WT social wiki tribunal social that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">we have talked about for a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.210" end="00:21:22.210" style="s2">section theoretically that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:23.860" style="s2">talked about in getting section we also</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.210" end="00:21:25.000" style="s2">say what&#39;s working what&#39;s beautiful then</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.860" end="00:21:26.620" style="s2">we can link to although this to be like</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.000" end="00:21:28.510" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s cool and happening but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">haven&#39;t necessarily but actually do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.510" end="00:21:33.090" style="s2">know I can&#39;t see who&#39;s immune it or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:33.090" style="s2">but if anyone else would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:47.830" style="s2">so if I could dream big just took a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">couple notes here so I wish that news</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.830" end="00:21:56.740" style="s2">was just more straightforward more to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:59.890" style="s2">the point you know where the the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.740" end="00:22:02.800" style="s2">relevant information was right at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.890" end="00:22:05.860" style="s2">top and then you know as the story</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.800" end="00:22:07.330" style="s2">expands and there&#39;s more detail it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.860" end="00:22:11.140" style="s2">further down I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.330" end="00:22:14.170" style="s2">I think my experiences it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.140" end="00:22:16.300" style="s2">like that I should get the meet the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.170" end="00:22:19.390" style="s2">important part of the story in the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.300" end="00:22:23.170" style="s2">couple sentences and then you know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.390" end="00:22:25.330" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;m seeing that um news</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.170" end="00:22:27.790" style="s2">that&#39;s more straightforward I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.330" end="00:22:29.860" style="s2">could trust the headlines we mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.790" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">that a little bit but gosh how many</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.860" end="00:22:34.570" style="s2">times I read a story and I&#39;m like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">isn&#39;t what the headline was saying um</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.570" end="00:22:45.610" style="s2">it&#39;s weird um I wish that there was more</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:52.780" style="s2">emphasis on I guess just better topics</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.610" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">emphasis on technology news that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.780" end="00:22:58.210" style="s2">health news</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">so when people felt like they went to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.210" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">whatever website or thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:09.330" style="s2">reading I mean we&#39;re not the news seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">so much about like personalities and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.330" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">just stories that aren&#39;t like helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:19.270" style="s2">my to my well-being</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:23.130" style="s2">um I don&#39;t know how else to put it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.270" end="00:23:23.130" style="s2">I wish that there were stories that</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">showcased good role models and people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.800" end="00:23:32.710" style="s2">that and role models like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of achievable in life like</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.710" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">wow look at this person and how they got</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:39.580" style="s2">their life together or something like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:41.170" style="s2">mean that would be cool you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.580" end="00:23:46.510" style="s2">find those but they&#39;re just not in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.170" end="00:23:50.580" style="s2">main things I wish that journal at</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.510" end="00:23:53.920" style="s2">journalism wasn&#39;t like pandering to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.580" end="00:23:57.730" style="s2">political parties or corporations there</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.920" end="00:23:59.380" style="s2">are some stories that like if you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.730" end="00:24:03.220" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking for they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.380" end="00:24:09.310" style="s2">like an ad but it&#39;s you know cloaked as</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.220" end="00:24:13.660" style="s2">a news story so that&#39;s a wish I wish</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.310" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">that I guess finally that it wasn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.660" end="00:24:18.970" style="s2">had news there are real things to fear</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:20.980" style="s2">in the world but I wish that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.970" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">playing to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.980" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">years so hugely and like there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:30.250" style="s2">terrible stories but I think right</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:31.660" style="s2">Daniel I&#39;m just gonna do you have one</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.250" end="00:24:33.730" style="s2">more point you would like in the future</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.059" end="00:24:44.049" style="s2">Daniel hmm hope to say quickly um I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.530" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">like to see more like I&#39;m a half hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.049" end="00:24:48.010" style="s2">away from the state capital in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:50.679" style="s2">Washington here but I&#39;d like to see more</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.010" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">of my local community news like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.679" end="00:24:54.220" style="s2">we don&#39;t have any way to totally connect</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">but there&#39;s thousands of people here and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.220" end="00:25:00.160" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there&#39;s news I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:25:02.470" style="s2">like neighborhood different with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.160" end="00:25:05.500" style="s2">know whatever but it&#39;s not it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.470" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">random and rare so it&#39;d be kind of cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.500" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">just to see the positive stuff is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">on in your community</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.379" end="00:25:19.379" style="s2">not quite sure so I think building a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.669" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">on what Bentley talked about with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.379" end="00:25:25.559" style="s2">like you know seeing a heavy emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:27.059" style="s2">the underlying source also understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.559" end="00:25:29.460" style="s2">through all the different channels</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.059" end="00:25:31.739" style="s2">involved who the experts are that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.460" end="00:25:34.289" style="s2">being touted as we see like for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.739" end="00:25:36.119" style="s2">with all kovat 19 thing oh we brought on</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.289" end="00:25:38.999" style="s2">a doctor to say this keep it a doctor of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.119" end="00:25:41.070" style="s2">what doctor philosophy I don&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.999" end="00:25:42.539" style="s2">that person has to say about the virus I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.070" end="00:25:45.210" style="s2">mean I do but don&#39;t tell me that it did</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.539" end="00:25:48.149" style="s2">or doctor because that&#39;s not the you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.210" end="00:25:50.099" style="s2">know that that&#39;s not the implication</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.149" end="00:25:52.950" style="s2">that they&#39;re using is that the person</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.099" end="00:25:55.229" style="s2">has you know a doctorate of something if</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.950" end="00:25:56.549" style="s2">the news says it that the person is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.229" end="00:25:59.909" style="s2">doctor that means something to people</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.549" end="00:26:01.519" style="s2">and I feel that there&#39;s a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.909" end="00:26:04.019" style="s2">going on and that&#39;s a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.519" end="00:26:06.330" style="s2">cornerstone of the misinformation thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.019" end="00:26:08.009" style="s2">is people kind of now know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.330" end="00:26:09.989" style="s2">trust our governments we can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.009" end="00:26:11.999" style="s2">news I think overall we know that we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.989" end="00:26:14.309" style="s2">trust some experts but now we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.999" end="00:26:15.989" style="s2">which ones and they&#39;re all being touted</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.309" end="00:26:17.340" style="s2">with the same like oh this person is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.989" end="00:26:19.080" style="s2">great they&#39;re smart you can totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.340" end="00:26:21.330" style="s2">trust what they&#39;re saying and then they</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.080" end="00:26:23.399" style="s2">contradict each other and so then we</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.330" end="00:26:24.809" style="s2">have to figure out okay so now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.399" end="00:26:26.759" style="s2">even figuring out the source because</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.809" end="00:26:28.619" style="s2">this person has a bunch of history and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.759" end="00:26:35.580" style="s2">probably a ton of sources that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.619" end="00:26:37.529" style="s2">reviewed how do I tell them apart I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.580" end="00:26:39.629" style="s2">try to quickly share mine there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.529" end="00:26:42.359" style="s2">of background I think we need before the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.629" end="00:26:44.369" style="s2">actual that isn&#39;t just information like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.359" end="00:26:46.769" style="s2">tools that help us assess and understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.369" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">science because unfortunately the media</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.769" end="00:26:50.220" style="s2">is where we get our science from as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:51.869" style="s2">as history to be able to zoom in and out</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.220" end="00:26:53.429" style="s2">of history and truly understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.869" end="00:26:55.289" style="s2">understand the complexities of it I</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.429" end="00:26:57.570" style="s2">think would really help with news in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.289" end="00:26:59.519" style="s2">particular that being said for news I</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.570" end="00:27:01.619" style="s2">want it broken down into what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.519" end="00:27:03.359" style="s2">happening what actually is happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.619" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">what how do I know that that happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.359" end="00:27:06.599" style="s2">how do I trust it why did it happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">which I can go do from the history and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.599" end="00:27:10.499" style="s2">also what does it mean for the future</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:11.879" style="s2">why does this matter right like so</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.499" end="00:27:15.330" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be speculation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.879" end="00:27:16.679" style="s2">gonna be very premature and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.330" end="00:27:18.629" style="s2">arbitrary it&#39;s gonna differ between</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.679" end="00:27:21.029" style="s2">person but the facts shouldn&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.629" end="00:27:22.679" style="s2">like what happened can we could have</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.029" end="00:27:23.770" style="s2">different opinions but the actual facts</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.679" end="00:27:25.150" style="s2">should be the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.770" end="00:27:27.100" style="s2">but even just having one place to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.150" end="00:27:28.929" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s more great area to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.100" end="00:27:30.070" style="s2">it broken down into who was involved how</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.929" end="00:27:30.610" style="s2">do we know they were involved what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.070" end="00:27:35.110" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.610" end="00:27:38.260" style="s2">having multiple sources of photographers</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.110" end="00:27:39.790" style="s2">and journalism are you having like what</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.260" end="00:27:41.890" style="s2">is a journalist I guess it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.790" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">because if we&#39;re all have phones are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.890" end="00:27:44.530" style="s2">all journalists because journalists are</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:45.910" style="s2">either reporting the facts so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.530" end="00:27:48.820" style="s2">giving you the commentary if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.910" end="00:27:50.200" style="s2">commentary I I do want journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.820" end="00:27:51.940" style="s2">can tell me the story in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.200" end="00:27:53.710" style="s2">going to be somewhat entertaining and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.940" end="00:27:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s Moorea I&#39;m going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.710" end="00:27:58.300" style="s2">information and so what does that look</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.049" end="00:29:44.380" style="s2">outlets and that then that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.400" end="00:29:45.730" style="s2">becomes almost like a patreon where that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.380" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">person says oh I&#39;ve got you know a</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:58.390" style="s2">thought before I was kinda like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.049" end="00:30:00.850" style="s2">perfect rendering idea one other idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.390" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">come now if this already exists then</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.850" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">like one second Daniel sorry because if</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:06.130" style="s2">we are switching over to the next topic</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:07.210" style="s2">which that&#39;ll be perfect for which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.130" end="00:30:08.500" style="s2">maybe not because maybe it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.210" end="00:30:11.260" style="s2">money in which case I&#39;ll let you still</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.500" end="00:30:12.760" style="s2">say it but so now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.260" end="00:30:14.740" style="s2">what we could actually create right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.760" end="00:30:16.270" style="s2">if we had ten thousand people and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.740" end="00:30:17.470" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.270" end="00:30:19.900" style="s2">like that might be in what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.470" end="00:30:23.169" style="s2">so go what would you what was the keys</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.900" end="00:30:26.350" style="s2">what if this could already exist I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.169" end="00:30:31.650" style="s2">what if you had a way to have a site</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.350" end="00:30:33.850" style="s2">that stories were voted up by</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.650" end="00:30:39.070" style="s2">significance or something should have</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.850" end="00:30:42.160" style="s2">like maybe like a crowd-sourced so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">because right now as we have it the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.160" end="00:30:47.620" style="s2">companies that are controlling the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:52.780" style="s2">narratives they decide always what&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.620" end="00:30:56.890" style="s2">the top right so yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.780" end="00:30:59.350" style="s2">read it but sure I do like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.890" end="00:31:00.970" style="s2">having the relevance be so I vote right</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.350" end="00:31:02.140" style="s2">ice meat something I say oh my god yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.970" end="00:31:03.880" style="s2">everyone needs to but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.140" end="00:31:05.710" style="s2">necessarily say everyone needs to they</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.880" end="00:31:06.820" style="s2">look at it and say oh you&#39;re Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.710" end="00:31:07.990" style="s2">right of course you think everyone needs</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.820" end="00:31:09.429" style="s2">to know this and it&#39;s that would send</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.299" end="00:31:21.220" style="s2">into account and then helps me vote in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.270" end="00:31:22.630" style="s2">that way so that I can say yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.220" end="00:31:25.330" style="s2">relevant everyone needs to know this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.630" end="00:31:27.160" style="s2">going on but it kind of only goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.330" end="00:31:28.330" style="s2">relevant people of like you know like</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.160" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">when Daniel mentioned technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.330" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">everyone needs to know what technology I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.040" style="s2">want to know about technology I know a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:35.260" style="s2">ton of people don&#39;t care at all right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.040" end="00:31:37.140" style="s2">like for me to say everyone needs to</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.140" end="00:31:41.590" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t gonna but there&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.820" end="00:31:44.140" style="s2">AI that could help us</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.590" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">I think for that I think you vote on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.140" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">category like how important is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.169" style="s2">thing to that category so is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.070" end="00:31:51.309" style="s2">super-important for technology great if</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.169" end="00:31:53.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t care about technology still</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.309" end="00:31:55.210" style="s2">don&#39;t show me but like if it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.710" end="00:31:57.130" style="s2">low importance for technology and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.210" end="00:31:59.380" style="s2">business the high importance for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.130" end="00:32:02.020" style="s2">environment then that can start to show</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.380" end="00:32:03.850" style="s2">you or start to control who it&#39;s shown</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.020" end="00:32:05.289" style="s2">to if other people who also liked the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.850" end="00:32:07.240" style="s2">environment said hey dude this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.289" end="00:32:08.500" style="s2">important for the environment it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.240" end="00:32:09.700" style="s2">saying you know that you&#39;re gonna agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.500" end="00:32:12.130" style="s2">that or what it&#39;s just saying it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.700" end="00:32:16.450" style="s2">important topic to to discuss as far as</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.130" end="00:32:18.490" style="s2">that top goes yeah and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.450" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">kind of how red it ended up working</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.490" end="00:32:23.289" style="s2">today because you subscribe to specific</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.510" style="s2">channels so they&#39;re both right up in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.289" end="00:32:27.340" style="s2">channels so it&#39;s not presented that way</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.510" end="00:32:29.110" style="s2">but I think has a similar net result</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:31.740" style="s2">which I think that still has the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.110" end="00:32:35.520" style="s2">challenge with the clickbait tier titles</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.740" end="00:32:38.669" style="s2">tend to get clicked up and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.520" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">kind of the journey method is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.669" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">taking that out you don&#39;t as like being</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:49.330" style="s2">a member of the network you agree that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:51.130" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna review five articles week</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.330" end="00:32:56.380" style="s2">or some X number of articles for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.130" end="00:32:59.020" style="s2">period of time and rate it yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.380" end="00:33:01.720" style="s2">on that mixed with the jury I think you</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.020" end="00:33:04.059" style="s2">also have sort of like fake articles</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.720" end="00:33:06.220" style="s2">that aren&#39;t published and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.059" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">if there&#39;s like template articles where</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.220" end="00:33:10.630" style="s2">you can just plug in you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.429" style="s2">a news madlibs where it&#39;s just sort of</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.429" end="00:33:17.169" style="s2">uh or if it actually takes an existing</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.710" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">article and just says okay we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.169" end="00:33:20.500" style="s2">make a couple of tweaks and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">change Trump to Hillary and change a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.500" end="00:33:24.340" style="s2">couple of things and just see how you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.140" end="00:33:30.850" style="s2">just said it was fake for the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.289" end="00:33:33.370" style="s2">person to do something like that so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.850" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">you have a jury but it&#39;s also using that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.370" end="00:33:37.299" style="s2">information from when they were given</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.190" style="s2">like a what do you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.299" end="00:33:40.809" style="s2">article oh you think that&#39;s terrible</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:48.730" style="s2">do that first yeah they have some sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.159" end="00:33:51.429" style="s2">of bias detection by by rating the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.730" end="00:33:54.659" style="s2">individual person&#39;s ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.429" end="00:33:54.659" style="s2">unbiased that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.620" end="00:34:02.649" style="s2">so if we wanted to I mean is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.389" end="00:34:07.029" style="s2">of where we&#39;re going to think for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.649" end="00:34:09.220" style="s2">ten people and the money or does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.029" end="00:34:10.450" style="s2">have another suggestion don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.220" end="00:34:12.520" style="s2">have one particular it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.450" end="00:34:14.169" style="s2">anything that is like is that possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.520" end="00:34:15.490" style="s2">for a hundred thousand dollars and ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.169" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">thousand people I don&#39;t know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.490" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">are tech to know more about the the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:21.970" style="s2">finances so I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:24.129" style="s2">like what could we solve for news with</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.970" end="00:34:27.460" style="s2">ten thousand people right maybe let me</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.129" end="00:34:29.740" style="s2">know I could build that in a weekend it</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.460" end="00:34:32.669" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t look good and if you had ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.740" end="00:34:35.970" style="s2">dozen people willing to try it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.669" end="00:34:39.099" style="s2">but but yeah I don&#39;t want to stop their</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.970" end="00:34:40.810" style="s2">ideas the jury thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.099" end="00:34:42.940" style="s2">about bid their you could build in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.810" end="00:34:44.530" style="s2">weekend yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it would just be</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.940" end="00:34:47.020" style="s2">reddit with an additional piece that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.530" end="00:34:49.149" style="s2">chooses you know five random people for</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.020" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">an article that comes in and has them</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.149" end="00:34:53.740" style="s2">review it before it shows it to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">community so people would still well I</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.740" end="00:34:58.359" style="s2">mean that you wouldn&#39;t be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:00.250" style="s2">your own news company but you could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.359" end="00:35:02.470" style="s2">a tour people could post articles to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.250" end="00:35:04.569" style="s2">that they see and then it puts it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.470" end="00:35:06.369" style="s2">through the round jury and then it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.569" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2">then it spits it out on the on the home</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.369" end="00:35:13.869" style="s2">page and then has tagging so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.250" end="00:35:16.270" style="s2">think I think that could be I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.869" end="00:35:17.859" style="s2">think there ends up being like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:20.230" style="s2">really difficult thing and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.859" end="00:35:21.579" style="s2">is where Billy and I are trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.230" end="00:35:24.150" style="s2">all right don&#39;t talk the entire time</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.579" end="00:35:26.260" style="s2">because he and I probably both could</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.150" end="00:35:27.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.260" end="00:35:31.300" style="s2">prongs on attack but I think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.940" end="00:35:32.530" style="s2">do to actually get it and like I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.300" end="00:35:33.910" style="s2">part of it is you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.530" end="00:35:35.619" style="s2">tackle the expert thing because if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.910" end="00:35:37.450" style="s2">have experts giving their feedback um</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.619" end="00:35:39.190" style="s2">you know this and the article and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.450" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">an that well why should we trust that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.190" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">person and then the evidence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:44.680" style="s2">being dissected we kind of have to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">some notion of understanding that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.680" end="00:35:48.700" style="s2">then you know either a or the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.180" end="00:35:51.220" style="s2">understanding it properly or B is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.700" end="00:35:53.020" style="s2">one out of ten articles on that topic</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.220" end="00:35:54.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s the only one that points in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.020" end="00:35:56.200" style="s2">that direction and the other nine</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.250" end="00:35:58.869" style="s2">appointee in the opposite direction how</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.200" end="00:36:02.770" style="s2">do we tell ya the the jury idea only</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.869" end="00:36:05.859" style="s2">really fixes the click bait issue if</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.770" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">someone still has a very eloquent Lee</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.859" end="00:36:11.140" style="s2">worded false information it&#39;ll still</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">spread well so it doesn&#39;t help with</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.140" end="00:36:17.620" style="s2">actual resemblance to reality yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.510" style="s2">think it tackles an important thing but</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.620" end="00:36:21.610" style="s2">I think with all of it if we just fix</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.510" end="00:36:23.140" style="s2">one it&#39;s just going to get gained in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.610" end="00:36:24.550" style="s2">slightly different way so it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.140" end="00:36:26.620" style="s2">needs to be like multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.550" end="00:36:29.710" style="s2">happening not necessarily at the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.620" end="00:36:31.900" style="s2">time but like intent you know in tandem</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.710" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">ish so that at some point they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.900" end="00:36:36.790" style="s2">sort of touching and good going towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:39.570" style="s2">the same goal which hopefully prevents</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.790" end="00:36:43.780" style="s2">these individual things from being gay</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.570" end="00:36:46.060" style="s2">yeah so have a secondary thing of kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.780" end="00:36:47.890" style="s2">of fact-checking and validation of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.060" end="00:36:51.610" style="s2">experts which is very much in the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.890" end="00:36:54.340" style="s2">election space and fact-checking which</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.610" end="00:36:57.310" style="s2">is B reason score space which will get</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.340" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">dive into detail if anyone wants to so</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.310" end="00:37:01.630" style="s2">for the moment what Adriel I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">invite a drill and Bentley to watch</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.630" end="00:37:04.990" style="s2">instead of participate and then see what</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.210" style="s2">everyone else comes up with in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.990" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">adjacent space and maybe I might might</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:10.590" style="s2">also because I have my own ideas but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t worked on them so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.590" end="00:37:15.880" style="s2">nebulous it&#39;s like I just want</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:19.930" style="s2">information what do you think 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.880" end="00:37:23.380" style="s2">people would want in a news source like</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.930" end="00:37:28.360" style="s2">what is it that they get from news that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.380" end="00:37:30.550" style="s2">together we could solve like news to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.360" end="00:37:33.580" style="s2">is information so it&#39;s like truth and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.550" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">trust and so asking people how do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.580" end="00:37:38.260" style="s2">know it&#39;s true and then how do you trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.780" style="s2">something and then figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.260" end="00:37:44.530" style="s2">make something with that involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.780" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">what could that look like with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.530" end="00:37:47.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t a million dollars because all my</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.270" style="s2">ideas really like I already said I need</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:41:04.110" style="s2">least the facts right and then ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.460" end="00:41:08.130" style="s2">thousand pairs of eyes I guess the news</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.110" end="00:41:15.360" style="s2">quite well and statistically in that ten</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.130" end="00:41:18.390" style="s2">thousand Minds pool there would be at</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.360" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">least few experts at least people who</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.390" end="00:41:25.800" style="s2">know about any field field enough to ask</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:29.330" style="s2">right questions if someone comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.800" end="00:41:34.260" style="s2">even very eloquently written article</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.330" end="00:41:40.050" style="s2">which is follows someone in that ten</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.260" end="00:41:43.500" style="s2">thousand people group would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.050" end="00:41:45.960" style="s2">come up with sufficiently sharp</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.500" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">questions to you know poke the balloon</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.960" end="00:41:54.660" style="s2">of the falsity of that article in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:59.730" style="s2">article so yeah a few dollars as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.660" end="00:42:02.790" style="s2">reward for finding Fox News maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.730" end="00:42:07.050" style="s2">for rewarding good articles and for</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.790" end="00:42:09.870" style="s2">rewarding curation process itself so not</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.050" end="00:42:16.430" style="s2">a lot but still sucking that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.870" end="00:42:19.860" style="s2">reward so that ten thousand is is</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.430" end="00:42:21.990" style="s2">purposefully vague because he can be any</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.860" end="00:42:23.430" style="s2">ten thousand you want it to be so we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.990" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">like we could get ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.430" end="00:42:28.970" style="s2">journalists together and ask them write</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:31.580" style="s2">your business is dying</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.970" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">yet what you do is so important what</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.580" end="00:42:35.740" style="s2">could we create that gets people the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:38.090" style="s2">information gets you your needs met and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.740" end="00:42:39.500" style="s2">gets an information source and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.090" end="00:42:40.820" style="s2">might be when it comes through right as</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.500" end="00:42:43.190" style="s2">ten thousand journalists create a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.820" end="00:42:45.020" style="s2">platform to but they also need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:47.990" style="s2">include that they have to include trust</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.020" end="00:42:49.730" style="s2">and transparency and we might it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.990" end="00:42:52.420" style="s2">including design for them we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.730" end="00:42:56.660" style="s2">gonna pay for it right so it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.420" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">balanced with is it is it worth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.660" end="00:43:01.400" style="s2">worth whatever the cost is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:04.250" style="s2">finance journalism in a way that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.400" end="00:43:06.230" style="s2">going to bias it yeah it might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.250" end="00:43:09.710" style="s2">helpful to look at some of those micro</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.230" end="00:43:13.550" style="s2">transaction models like if if they exist</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.710" end="00:43:16.430" style="s2">could could you use tokens that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.550" end="00:43:18.260" style="s2">cashed out you know once they hit a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.430" end="00:43:21.619" style="s2">certain limit so you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.260" end="00:43:24.290" style="s2">crushed by the transaction fees you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.619" end="00:43:27.380" style="s2">and you have like community voting</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.290" end="00:43:28.820" style="s2">essentially on articles and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.380" end="00:43:34.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m just throwing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.820" end="00:43:38.119" style="s2">around if we want to pay people you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.010" end="00:43:41.390" style="s2">for doing really good stuff that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.119" end="00:43:46.520" style="s2">have the corporate and the backing of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.390" end="00:43:50.330" style="s2">things of entities that have agendas we</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.520" end="00:43:58.750" style="s2">got to free up these folks to really do</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.330" end="00:43:58.750" style="s2">what they&#39;re talented at a look Cheney</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.839" end="00:44:06.589" style="s2">steam it steam it&#39;s called and it works</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.800" end="00:44:10.369" style="s2">more or less like this exactly right you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.589" end="00:44:14.930" style="s2">can said it&#39;s not a new site it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.369" end="00:44:18.310" style="s2">the site is kind of blocking space maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:21.589" style="s2">something like this but the point is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.310" end="00:44:25.010" style="s2">uses microtransactions and everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.589" end="00:44:28.119" style="s2">able to vote on some articles they like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.010" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">and voting is basically identical to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.119" end="00:44:38.119" style="s2">paying the author of the article so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:41.960" style="s2">not sure how well it works I look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.119" end="00:44:46.730" style="s2">that the years ago and you just start</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.960" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if it how it works now so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.730" end="00:44:55.580" style="s2">mean if the model is proven to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">a good thing or not but something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.580" end="00:45:06.980" style="s2">this exists Shila do you have any I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:08.210" style="s2">a couple things I don&#39;t know if they fit</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.980" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">in right here one thing I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.210" end="00:45:14.690" style="s2">is if we had like credentials of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.890" end="00:45:17.450" style="s2">sort each person that puts out an</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.690" end="00:45:19.790" style="s2">article then there&#39;s like a link to all</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.450" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">the articles they put out before and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.790" end="00:45:26.140" style="s2">where they&#39;ve gone so you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">get a framework of their stance and just</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.140" end="00:45:32.570" style="s2">an easy way to click on that so you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:34.310" style="s2">see their history in a way also I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.570" end="00:45:37.880" style="s2">thinking a lot about right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.310" end="00:45:40.040" style="s2">talking online and clicking but what</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.880" end="00:45:44.510" style="s2">about radio I feel like radio is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.040" end="00:45:47.360" style="s2">actually possibly more harmful because</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.510" end="00:45:52.700" style="s2">there&#39;s these short bursts of stories</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.360" end="00:45:56.180" style="s2">they&#39;re just their take on a story often</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.700" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re not actually they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.180" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">know the real source they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.640" style="s2">know the background that they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:04.070" style="s2">a lot of information to people who grab</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.640" end="00:46:06.320" style="s2">it and think that now they have more</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.070" end="00:46:09.290" style="s2">ammo to attack the other side whichever</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.320" end="00:46:14.650" style="s2">radio station so just I was thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.290" end="00:46:17.210" style="s2">there a way to would there be a way to I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.650" end="00:46:21.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I would say reprimand</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.210" end="00:46:23.390" style="s2">people but having a way to say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.260" end="00:46:24.050" style="s2">that story that you heard a half-hour</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.390" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.050" end="00:46:29.390" style="s2">is false or most of us or something I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:33.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.390" end="00:46:35.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.770" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">but it would be great be great to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.330" end="00:46:39.050" style="s2">able to retract any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:45.340" style="s2">misinformation that we put out into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.050" end="00:46:50.390" style="s2">world it&#39;s painful is it a bad way Oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.340" end="00:46:53.180" style="s2">retracted information oh there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.390" end="00:46:54.920" style="s2">nothing called a soundbite which I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.180" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">Tigers</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.920" end="00:47:06.349" style="s2">equivalent to a meme in a written space</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:12.660" style="s2">but in radio space it&#39;s soundbite and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.349" end="00:47:14.670" style="s2">mr. president Trump who is tall - these</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.660" end="00:47:18.450" style="s2">are good at sound bites and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.670" end="00:47:22.980" style="s2">form of very actually that&#39;s a nasty way</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.450" end="00:47:24.779" style="s2">of communicating because when you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:28.349" style="s2">something that is catchy enough and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.779" end="00:47:31.829" style="s2">short enough you don&#39;t actually provide</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.349" end="00:47:34.440" style="s2">any useful information in this thing but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.829" end="00:47:37.799" style="s2">still it spreads like wildfire he said</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">something really catchy and it puts some</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.799" end="00:47:54.869" style="s2">something bad light and yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:56.549" style="s2">wrong this is such a rich space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.869" end="00:47:59.160" style="s2">why there&#39;s so many people working in it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.549" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">and yet like what could ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.160" end="00:48:03.269" style="s2">people coming together and doing like</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:05.009" style="s2">let&#39;s say ten thousand Vancouverites if</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.269" end="00:48:07.049" style="s2">once clothes came together and said okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.009" end="00:48:11.490" style="s2">we we clearly add spec kuva right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.049" end="00:48:13.349" style="s2">what local federal and global news what</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.490" end="00:48:16.259" style="s2">is it we need what are the sectors and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.349" end="00:48:19.430" style="s2">what is there one we want to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.259" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2">on and start there or do we want like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.430" end="00:48:25.049" style="s2">lot about a little or a little but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">right so um how deep do we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.049" end="00:48:28.380" style="s2">and I think that is about working</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:32.759" style="s2">through it with 10,000 people asking</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.380" end="00:48:34.349" style="s2">like what is it you you trust in news um</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.759" end="00:48:36.029" style="s2">one of the things I would like to see if</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.349" end="00:48:38.279" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have experts be on the news</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.029" end="00:48:40.049" style="s2">is like a voting system for who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.279" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">those experts I know like the background</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.049" end="00:48:43.650" style="s2">is great but also like okay you have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.420" style="s2">economist it&#39;s actually an economist</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.650" end="00:48:46.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the top of their field but how many</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.420" end="00:48:48.539" style="s2">of the other economists agree with them</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.950" end="00:48:50.549" style="s2">and how often have they been right which</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.539" end="00:48:52.019" style="s2">I know is the background but like to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.549" end="00:48:54.569" style="s2">able to actually say you know who I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.019" end="00:48:58.109" style="s2">like to have a conversation like Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.569" end="00:48:59.670" style="s2">Sanders and Joe Rogan I know they</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.109" end="00:49:01.859" style="s2">already have but like you don&#39;t it mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.670" end="00:49:04.140" style="s2">that like we can vote that up and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.859" end="00:49:06.450" style="s2">invite them and and it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.140" end="00:49:07.620" style="s2">mandatory we&#39;re not think of remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.450" end="00:49:09.750" style="s2">not anything but like hey</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.620" end="00:49:11.790" style="s2">people want you to talk and we want</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.750" end="00:49:14.700" style="s2">these two experts to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.790" end="00:49:21.630" style="s2">if there&#39;s going to be experts having</p>

<p begin="00:49:27.330" end="00:49:31.400" style="s2">said there&#39;s there are experts in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.920" end="00:49:33.720" style="s2">10,000 so asking who it who are the</p>

<p begin="00:51:22.859" end="00:51:29.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t because the doctor said is true</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.040" end="00:51:40.920" style="s2">title but they also have a history of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.030" end="00:51:44.340" style="s2">very bad science of like being sued for</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.010" end="00:52:00.170" style="s2">they had maybe been sued for something</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.440" end="00:52:10.650" style="s2">history of their research and was the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.060" end="00:52:13.109" style="s2">research actually you know the comment</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.650" end="00:52:14.580" style="s2">he agreed that the research is correct</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.109" end="00:52:18.750" style="s2">and stuff like that it&#39;ll be very</p>

<p begin="00:52:18.750" end="00:52:25.349" style="s2">come back in it was only an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.410" end="00:52:26.760" style="s2">like have to happen well I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.349" end="00:52:28.260" style="s2">last a little bit I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.760" end="00:52:30.690" style="s2">wiki lecture and a Joe&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.260" end="00:52:31.770" style="s2">because he has the expert sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.690" end="00:52:33.780" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know I drew if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.770" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">considered a plug-in but you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.780" end="00:52:40.339" style="s2">Daniel that&#39;s definitely possible I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">actually written a couple plugins that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:49.050" style="s2">the manipulate the the webpage there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:51.030" style="s2">something else I was gonna save</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.050" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">everybody yeah I think the plug-in is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.030" end="00:52:57.060" style="s2">almost mandatory at this point like it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:58.830" style="s2">kind of has to be a plugin so that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.060" end="00:53:02.220" style="s2">can start to sort of interject this</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.830" end="00:53:04.320" style="s2">information on you know maybe new</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.220" end="00:53:07.020" style="s2">sources that wouldn&#39;t like that level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.320" end="00:53:09.330" style="s2">transparency and I think things like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.020" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">know it could understand the webpage and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.330" end="00:53:13.320" style="s2">figure out who the author is if we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:14.730" style="s2">a team of people going through and sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.320" end="00:53:16.710" style="s2">of collecting information and submitting</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.730" end="00:53:18.900" style="s2">it you can also just know like oh you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.210" end="00:53:30.540" style="s2">outcome and then as well for things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.089" end="00:53:33.390" style="s2">did videos and technically even audio</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.630" end="00:53:57.290" style="s2">not true here&#39;s why now and this thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.490" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not true or false he&#39;s just making</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.290" end="00:54:02.780" style="s2">a claim with no evidence so yeah one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:07.010" style="s2">the things when the toosh was talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.780" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">about the like debunked doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.010" end="00:54:11.240" style="s2">stuff especially i actually want a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.920" style="s2">timeline on what happens there because</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.240" end="00:54:14.120" style="s2">if they were credible up and to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.920" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">point they published something</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.120" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">controversial and now they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:21.170" style="s2">discredited what does that mean right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.620" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">like to have the actual timeline of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.170" end="00:54:25.580" style="s2">right they were sued for malpractice 30</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:27.740" style="s2">times then decided to do this versus oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.580" end="00:54:29.570" style="s2">they were really well established and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.740" end="00:54:33.560" style="s2">then they fell from grace and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.570" end="00:54:38.380" style="s2">vilify them my god I know a doctor in</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.040" end="00:54:52.070" style="s2">look bad but really it&#39;s because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.560" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">bucking a misinformation trend in the</p>

<p begin="00:54:57.170" end="00:55:01.700" style="s2">licenses are pretty biased so it depends</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.870" end="00:55:06.350" style="s2">kind of on how you look at it it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.700" end="00:55:07.880" style="s2">hard to to get a snapshot into that</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.350" end="00:55:15.740" style="s2">although it&#39;d be good to have the info</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.880" end="00:55:19.220" style="s2">but this the timeline it&#39;s also no good</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.740" end="00:55:20.540" style="s2">good I guess to like dream big as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.220" end="00:55:22.820" style="s2">you know if you had this browser</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.540" end="00:55:26.120" style="s2">extension or you know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.820" end="00:55:29.090" style="s2">platform that mixed in and I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.120" end="00:55:33.530" style="s2">if you what if journalists could also</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.090" end="00:55:38.030" style="s2">like make a profile on there and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.530" end="00:55:40.670" style="s2">you could build in like a token system</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.030" end="00:55:42.440" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m look I&#39;m the type of person</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.030" end="00:56:06.190" style="s2">cool to be able to have an account and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.460" end="00:56:08.859" style="s2">like seven people tokens and once it hit</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:12.369" style="s2">a certain amount it cashed out I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.490" end="00:56:55.480" style="s2">ideas probably well but I&#39;d you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.980" end="00:56:58.750" style="s2">after talking through I really liked the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.480" end="00:57:02.650" style="s2">idea of some sort of random chosen jury</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.750" end="00:57:05.859" style="s2">to validate or to at least look and see</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.650" end="00:57:09.220" style="s2">the value of content and include that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.859" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">kind of retitling that wiki WT social</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.220" end="00:57:15.490" style="s2">does and and I think you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.810" style="s2">within that dollar amount and that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.490" end="00:57:24.550" style="s2">space that might be something</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.810" end="00:57:27.369" style="s2">interesting yeah I think if you combined</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.550" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">that with just like a simple system that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.369" end="00:57:31.329" style="s2">sort of help people group news articles</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.710" style="s2">so you can say all these neuticle all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.329" end="00:57:35.140" style="s2">these news articles are about the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.710" end="00:57:37.510" style="s2">thing and then almost have the jury sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.140" end="00:57:40.810" style="s2">of like try to create the the aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.510" end="00:57:43.420" style="s2">the okay so with all this known what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.810" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">true what what should the headline be</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.420" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">that sort of thing and then I think you</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.770" style="s2">can build that out in a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:49.770" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.010" end="00:58:02.900" style="s2">you know for me I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.930" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">powerful thing we could do with a small</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.900" end="00:58:07.010" style="s2">amount of money in people is to create</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">an imbd for politicians and business</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.010" end="00:58:11.090" style="s2">leaders and journalists like just keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">adding to the list as we need them but</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.090" end="00:58:15.530" style="s2">like the politicians specifically where</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:16.760" style="s2">have they been wherever they were - did</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.530" end="00:58:17.930" style="s2">they get their funding from and getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.760" end="00:58:20.180" style="s2">that in a way then looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.930" end="00:58:21.950" style="s2">because that&#39;s news in of itself right</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.180" end="00:58:23.330" style="s2">how do we trust that where did we get</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.950" end="00:58:24.740" style="s2">that from a lot of it&#39;s just public</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.330" end="00:58:26.780" style="s2">discourse right well they learned the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.740" end="00:58:29.030" style="s2">CEO of this company that&#39;s public</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.780" end="00:58:30.380" style="s2">information and having that either case</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.030" end="00:58:32.570" style="s2">but having it done because if we did</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.380" end="00:58:36.800" style="s2">that collectively it&#39;s not on one person</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.570" end="00:58:38.930" style="s2">to then be legally liable for the you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.800" end="00:58:40.670" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s like they&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.930" end="00:58:42.920" style="s2">out that person&#39;s information as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.670" end="00:58:46.250" style="s2">to us collectively doing it&#39;d be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.920" end="00:58:49.430" style="s2">most powerful thing I think so that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.250" end="00:58:52.190" style="s2">be the IP ADB internet politicians</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.430" end="00:58:59.660" style="s2">nativists the new name of food</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.190" end="00:59:03.770" style="s2">collections of course so yeah that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.660" end="00:59:05.330" style="s2">was actually considered oh I like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.770" end="00:59:07.430" style="s2">and I like the fact of having it as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.330" end="00:59:10.190" style="s2">time line if you can make it that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.430" end="00:59:18.890" style="s2">we Kesey you like click on and then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.190" end="00:59:21.950" style="s2">see that person&#39;s timeline like also I</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.890" end="00:59:25.550" style="s2">like that idea when I come here I also</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.950" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">just end up feeling a bit inspired so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.550" end="00:59:33.290" style="s2">guess I&#39;m thinking today about you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">do I have friends locally that I already</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.290" end="00:59:39.109" style="s2">know that like would want to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:41.810" style="s2">together and just share the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.109" end="00:59:44.990" style="s2">matters to them you know on some</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.810" end="00:59:48.619" style="s2">platform that exists just to get that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.990" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">going in my own circle like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.619" end="00:59:57.800" style="s2">I could probably do today so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:59.510" style="s2">I love that Daniel okay so the point of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.800" end="01:00:01.340" style="s2">this is to bring inspirations like what</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.510" end="01:00:02.810" style="s2">could we do with 10,000 people but like</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.340" end="01:00:04.220" style="s2">bringing it down to the individual like</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.810" end="01:00:06.020" style="s2">and there&#39;s things we can do today</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.220" end="01:00:08.990" style="s2">without getting 10,000 people together</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.020" end="01:00:10.510" style="s2">is also a very very even more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.990" end="01:00:12.280" style="s2">thing so</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.510" end="01:00:14.110" style="s2">we are at the 1 hour mark we can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.280" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">goodbye to YouTube and Facebook if</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.110" end="01:00:19.740" style="s2">nobody has any closing questions all</p>
