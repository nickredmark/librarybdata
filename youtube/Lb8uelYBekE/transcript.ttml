<p begin="00:01:00.700" end="00:01:05.860" style="s2">have some questions afterwards and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:07.899" style="s2">we&#39;ll open up for a group dialog and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.860" end="00:01:09.610" style="s2">the group dialog will work you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.899" end="00:01:12.039" style="s2">question just write it down in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.610" end="00:01:13.660" style="s2">box and I&#39;ll call on you just unmute</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.039" end="00:01:15.070" style="s2">yourself or if you want me to read your</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.660" end="00:01:18.009" style="s2">question just indicate that when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.070" end="00:01:19.149" style="s2">write it down and then just keep it nice</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.009" end="00:01:21.160" style="s2">and crisp because we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.149" end="00:01:25.210" style="s2">people in the chat and we probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.160" end="00:01:27.880" style="s2">get to everyone&#39;s question so that being</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.880" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">here yes can you hear me yes beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:38.979" style="s2">so Jordan I&#39;ll hand it to you my friend</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:40.390" style="s2">what&#39;s the situation Peter can I assume</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.979" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s read my medium piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.390" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">Josh are they recapitulating some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">that I do not know that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:51.310" style="s2">question maybe people in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.840" style="s2">can just say you&#39;ve read it do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.310" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">opposite if you haven&#39;t read it please</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.840" end="00:01:57.159" style="s2">give it a signal forget a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">then we&#39;ll have to recapitulate it with</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.159" end="00:02:04.540" style="s2">all reddit&#39;s as nicholas great all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:07.149" style="s2">so so we have a baseline recognition</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.540" end="00:02:09.160" style="s2">that the the perspective from which to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.149" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">perceive what&#39;s happening is the level</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.160" end="00:02:14.019" style="s2">of a meta-crisis and I did not include a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">particular element in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.019" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">that can be brought all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:22.360" style="s2">highest level but the best way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:24.100" style="s2">holding it is in fact a spiritual crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.360" end="00:02:25.600" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.100" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">process of working through a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.600" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">crisis that all fractal levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:33.310" style="s2">identity of which the objective piece is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">showing up enormous length</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.310" end="00:02:41.020" style="s2">we can make it very practical already</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">and it&#39;s in an accelerating basis in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.020" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2">physical health crisis is cascading into</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">a mental health crisis and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:48.730" style="s2">to begin seeing that more and more that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:50.140" style="s2">has more and more people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.730" end="00:02:52.840" style="s2">forced to simply get out of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.140" end="00:02:54.819" style="s2">comfort zone often times it&#39;s very rapid</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:55.959" style="s2">and intense way and then be put into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.819" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">things that they simply aren&#39;t prepared</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.959" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">to be put into</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:05.180" style="s2">in addition the real circumstances of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">life are actually changing rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.180" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">for many people they are active actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">in some deep sense a powerless and be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:18.170" style="s2">their best interest aren&#39;t in fact being</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:21.720" style="s2">well served so I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.170" end="00:03:25.380" style="s2">if it&#39;s zoom in on the economic</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">subdomain of the meta crisis in the US</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.380" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s a pretty good bellwether of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:36.690" style="s2">our o W in this case we had a level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:38.270" style="s2">unemployment that I don&#39;t say it well</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually shocking it&#39;s astounding</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.270" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">as of yesterday Goldman Sachs indicated</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:46.470" style="s2">the 2.5 million Americans will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">applying for unemployment this week so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.470" end="00:03:51.410" style="s2">in one week 2.5 million that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:51.410" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.340" end="00:03:57.769" style="s2">fraction of the total number of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">who ended up going into unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.769" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">during the financial crisis is ten times</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:04.610" style="s2">the peak have been any given period of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">time in the financial crisis so right</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.610" end="00:04:09.860" style="s2">eight times the peak and this is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">the first week okay now the point of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.860" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:18.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like a big wave nice we&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">these different systems and each of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.730" end="00:04:21.489" style="s2">systems has a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">resilience which of course has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.489" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">moved into a pretty high level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:29.950" style="s2">fragility and the primary characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:33.070" style="s2">of the phenomenon that we&#39;re witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.950" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">right now is a singular level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.070" end="00:04:39.730" style="s2">velocity complexity and magnitude in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:42.540" style="s2">short period of time the thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.730" end="00:04:45.700" style="s2">virus is not necessarily that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.540" end="00:04:46.900" style="s2">really really bad sickness the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.700" end="00:04:50.050" style="s2">about the virus is because of its</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.900" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">characteristics it ramps very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.050" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">and by the time we know that it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:56.590" style="s2">it&#39;s actually real it&#39;s so big that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">hits as hard and it overwhelms for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.590" end="00:05:00.690" style="s2">example the medical assistants these big</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.630" end="00:05:03.190" style="s2">waves coming through and hitting systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:05.350" style="s2">faster than can react with a magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.190" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">that&#39;s well beyond their capacity then</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.350" end="00:05:09.760" style="s2">they break and that then spreads</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">contagion outward into other elements of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.760" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">the meta system so in this case all at</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.390" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">but it work and all at once for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.640" end="00:05:27.920" style="s2">if you look at the system fragility</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:30.920" style="s2">Bridgewater Just&#39;s put out an analysis</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.920" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">that they think in the u.s. four point</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.920" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">five trillion dollars of earnings will</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:39.650" style="s2">be lost by public companies over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">period of the next two months which is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.650" end="00:05:46.040" style="s2">lot I a really astounding amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:47.960" style="s2">earnings but that&#39;s just public</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.040" end="00:05:49.340" style="s2">companies and if you look at the impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.960" end="00:05:50.480" style="s2">on public companies there are some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.340" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">those public companies that are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.480" end="00:05:54.470" style="s2">break meaning that they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">earnings capacity they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.470" end="00:05:57.410" style="s2">ability to reduce costs that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:58.910" style="s2">have the bank account to absorb the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.410" end="00:06:00.350" style="s2">amount of reduction in earnings they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.910" end="00:06:02.870" style="s2">going to have and they&#39;ll just break and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.350" end="00:06:04.610" style="s2">that will of course then bang in two</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.870" end="00:06:07.430" style="s2">directions little being sideways into</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.610" end="00:06:09.770" style="s2">for example their employees who will</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.430" end="00:06:11.180" style="s2">either be laid off to help the company</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.770" end="00:06:13.250" style="s2">survive or will be laid up because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:16.450" style="s2">company didn&#39;t survive and it will go up</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.250" end="00:06:16.450" style="s2">into the political environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">Goldman Sachs and Bridgewater so far at</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.240" end="00:06:24.750" style="s2">least haven&#39;t said anything about B</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.710" end="00:06:25.920" style="s2">people in the middle class which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.750" end="00:06:27.210" style="s2">where the wave is actually hitting the</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.819" end="00:13:32.759" style="s2">sovereignty there are competent people</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.529" end="00:13:35.429" style="s2">who have been doing this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.759" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">and we&#39;re getting better at knowing what</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:41.159" style="s2">which is I think is a key question so if</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.019" end="00:13:43.549" style="s2">we have questions around that let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.159" end="00:13:43.549" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.480" end="00:13:50.760" style="s2">all right I think that&#39;s probably enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.950" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">from the sort of view point of view so</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.760" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">where&#39;s the best branching point you</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:59.280" style="s2">take this yeah so ask you maybe one or</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:02.010" style="s2">two questions Jordan but if anyone has</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.280" end="00:14:06.570" style="s2">questions just write in the chat box and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.010" end="00:14:08.670" style="s2">then I&#39;ll call on you so one question is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.570" end="00:14:11.070" style="s2">talking a lot of people and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.670" end="00:14:13.350" style="s2">people are confused about how to sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.070" end="00:14:15.870" style="s2">making choice making this environment a</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.670" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">unhealthy a lot of people have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.590" end="00:14:27.900" style="s2">telling me so do you have any general</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:30.510" style="s2">practical like advice tips heuristics on</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.900" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">point to be held because this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.930" end="00:14:44.190" style="s2">this is the way this thing happens like</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:46.260" style="s2">why it works so well is it be the answer</p>

<p begin="00:14:46.260" end="00:14:51.780" style="s2">different synergies so the first answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.740" end="00:14:54.570" style="s2">is to remember that since leaking choice</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.780" end="00:14:55.710" style="s2">making always comes from sovereignty so</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.270" end="00:15:04.140" style="s2">making so the first answer is begin at</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.059" end="00:21:01.620" style="s2">said okay I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.060" end="00:22:36.030" style="s2">in America and we can&#39;t afford to deal</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:39.540" style="s2">with any medical costs should she go</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.030" end="00:22:42.150" style="s2">back to Canada and if she does she has</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">more and actually take advantage of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:56.270" style="s2">leverage point in history I&#39;m curious</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:17.320" style="s2">very long list so let me see if I can</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">simple and of course really very hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.820" end="00:27:20.640" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got people who have moved</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:21.750" style="s2">across they figured out what the right</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.200" end="00:38:00.119" style="s2">the normal way that we respond to most</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:38:01.290" style="s2">natural disasters is uniquely inhibited</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.119" end="00:38:04.200" style="s2">but the context that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.290" end="00:38:05.400" style="s2">in a whole bunch of people getting</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.120" end="00:38:21.060" style="s2">gonna have to rapidly figure out a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.650" end="00:38:22.680" style="s2">to quarantine the people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.060" end="00:38:24.330" style="s2">need to be protected and then put</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.680" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">able-bodied people on the frontlines to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.330" end="00:38:27.560" style="s2">actually deal with that problem then</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:31.650" style="s2">figure out how to do with the rest later</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.560" end="00:38:32.940" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s just reality let&#39;s take it</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.650" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">up one level and look at the meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.940" end="00:38:40.020" style="s2">reality daniel trachtenberg brought this</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.020" end="00:38:45.540" style="s2">first responders I think think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.250" end="00:38:47.100" style="s2">medical EMS and even like military as we</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.540" end="00:38:48.600" style="s2">start moving closer and closer to having</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.100" end="00:38:51.060" style="s2">the need to actually start using</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.370" end="00:38:57.750" style="s2">suits and what that means simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.670" end="00:39:00.630" style="s2">is that they&#39;re going to get infected</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.750" end="00:39:04.200" style="s2">and act as vectors for for dissemination</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.630" end="00:39:06.060" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna get sick so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.200" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">kind of needing mindful of that at a</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:34.220" style="s2">challenging to deal with what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:36.230" style="s2">that is an earthquake is a nature driven</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.740" end="00:42:14.370" style="s2">yeah and this is kind of one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.510" end="00:42:16.050" style="s2">the water comes the tide comes in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.370" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">tide comes out alluvial plain things</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.250" style="s2">out certain portions of what&#39;s developed</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.780" end="00:42:24.840" style="s2">now will in fact wash out and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.250" end="00:42:27.480" style="s2">challenge is going to be how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.840" end="00:42:29.820" style="s2">maximum move things up the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.480" end="00:42:32.940" style="s2">complexity developmental landscape which</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.820" end="00:42:34.440" style="s2">is to say there are in fact staged</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.940" end="00:42:35.850" style="s2">developments there are things where once</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.440" end="00:42:37.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually learned it it&#39;s just now</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.850" end="00:42:40.910" style="s2">part of reality it doesn&#39;t get unlearned</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.590" end="00:42:40.910" style="s2">even when the pressure lowers</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.130" end="00:42:47.299" style="s2">relationships that are built real</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.799" end="00:42:54.289" style="s2">think about that metaphor of World War</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.109" end="00:42:55.789" style="s2">two the people who went and fought in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.289" end="00:42:57.829" style="s2">World War two and built real</p>

<p begin="00:43:01.190" end="00:43:03.829" style="s2">tough he could get on the phone and call</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.539" end="00:43:06.140" style="s2">your buddy in New York and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.829" end="00:43:07.670" style="s2">remember me like yeah I remember you you</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.140" end="00:43:10.339" style="s2">were next to me and then in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.670" end="00:43:11.900" style="s2">foxhole I need some help and help</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.339" end="00:43:15.170" style="s2">happens because you&#39;re operating from a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.900" end="00:43:17.269" style="s2">transcendent relationship that&#39;s one so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.170" end="00:43:19.400" style="s2">again if we can move the stack down into</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.269" end="00:43:23.329" style="s2">building that kind of fabric that kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.400" end="00:43:25.759" style="s2">of fabric doesn&#39;t go away second habits</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.329" end="00:43:27.619" style="s2">like building better intuitions on how</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.759" end="00:43:31.339" style="s2">to do this kind of thing right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.619" end="00:43:33.019" style="s2">people are forced out of the inertia of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.339" end="00:43:35.779" style="s2">their time being spent doing other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.019" end="00:43:36.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a found opportunity either we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.779" end="00:43:39.589" style="s2">do it because that environment isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.920" end="00:43:41.509" style="s2">exist anymore or the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.589" end="00:43:43.400" style="s2">moment is actually pushing us past</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.509" end="00:43:46.339" style="s2">minimum thresholds of not being lazy and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.400" end="00:43:47.869" style="s2">actually learning new skills all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.339" end="00:43:49.670" style="s2">well as fast as possible like take that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.869" end="00:43:51.499" style="s2">seriously learn new skills like really</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.670" end="00:43:53.869" style="s2">learn how to build a capacity to your</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.499" end="00:43:56.210" style="s2">capacities of discernment really learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.869" end="00:43:58.369" style="s2">how to build more conceptual landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.210" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">and build the interior of your psyche of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.369" end="00:44:02.450" style="s2">escape so you&#39;re actually able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.390" end="00:44:04.849" style="s2">perceive what&#39;s going on better physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.450" end="00:44:07.430" style="s2">infrastructure there are tools being</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.849" end="00:44:09.019" style="s2">built those tools more or less don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.430" end="00:44:12.190" style="s2">necessarily need to go away if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.019" end="00:44:12.190" style="s2">really good tools they won&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.320" end="00:44:17.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily need mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:18.340" style="s2">way that that&#39;s where all the attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.800" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">needs to go</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.340" end="00:44:21.250" style="s2">those first two layers are more</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:23.530" style="s2">important they&#39;re more fundamental the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.250" end="00:44:24.580" style="s2">more the way that self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.530" end="00:44:26.050" style="s2">collective intelligence actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.580" end="00:44:27.430" style="s2">operates because a lot of physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.050" end="00:44:29.020" style="s2">infrastructure is going to be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.430" end="00:44:32.380" style="s2">together to meet the needs of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.020" end="00:44:34.150" style="s2">as it should be so it&#39;s more like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.380" end="00:44:35.620" style="s2">the topology that infrastructure seeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.150" end="00:44:36.850" style="s2">what kinds of things work and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.620" end="00:44:38.920" style="s2">saying okay how do we build on top of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.850" end="00:44:40.420" style="s2">that but on occasion some pieces might</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.920" end="00:44:43.050" style="s2">actually just be permanent upgrades of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.420" end="00:44:43.050" style="s2">our collective capacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.190" end="00:44:50.980" style="s2">okay so this one is from Adams as</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.789" end="00:44:52.359" style="s2">interesting wide networks of artists</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.980" end="00:44:54.309" style="s2">musicians creative practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.359" end="00:44:55.660" style="s2">normally focused on long-term shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.309" end="00:44:58.030" style="s2">thinking opening new spaces</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.660" end="00:44:59.890" style="s2">best way for their faculty a for those</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.030" end="00:45:03.940" style="s2">faculties to contribute in the current</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.890" end="00:45:05.260" style="s2">context yeah so let&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.940" end="00:45:07.000" style="s2">hammer in that notion to transcend an</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.260" end="00:45:08.890" style="s2">operator like I said at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.000" end="00:45:10.420" style="s2">this is a spiritual crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.890" end="00:45:12.010" style="s2">deepest best work is actually done at</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.420" end="00:45:16.180" style="s2">the spiritual level if you can find a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.010" end="00:45:18.760" style="s2">way to actually synthesize collectively</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.180" end="00:45:20.530" style="s2">if our collective soul can hear that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.760" end="00:45:22.510" style="s2">which is calling to change within us and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.530" end="00:45:24.130" style="s2">then you can communicate that so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.510" end="00:45:25.900" style="s2">everyone is actually feeling that thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.130" end="00:45:27.940" style="s2">resonating within themselves and get it</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.900" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">voice so they in themselves can actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.940" end="00:45:32.289" style="s2">feel the light coming through themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.660" style="s2">and grow from their interior that is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.289" end="00:45:37.950" style="s2">highest possibility for the whole that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.660" end="00:45:37.950" style="s2">is the job of the artists now</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.359" end="00:45:48.550" style="s2">Nate you had a question or Jake I should</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.090" end="00:45:51.910" style="s2">say Jake the book networked a collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.550" end="00:45:55.630" style="s2">intelligence yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.910" end="00:45:57.340" style="s2">so it seems like networked collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.630" end="00:45:59.859" style="s2">intelligence as a mode of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.340" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">of things orient yourself because it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.859" end="00:46:04.300" style="s2">so effective and kind of ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:06.340" style="s2">curve of the kind of centralized sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.300" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">making organs for this crisis has</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.340" end="00:46:10.119" style="s2">demonstrated legitimacy to the broader</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:12.190" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.119" end="00:46:14.740" style="s2">and so I suspect that more and more</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.190" end="00:46:16.060" style="s2">people will be moving toward using that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.740" end="00:46:17.470" style="s2">as their their primary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.060" end="00:46:22.119" style="s2">sense-making especially since they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.470" end="00:46:23.650" style="s2">gonna be digital as well but but there</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.119" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">are obviously dynamics of social</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.650" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">contagion and and panic that the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:30.340" style="s2">orient toward and I&#39;m wondering what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:32.440" style="s2">think the best way to mitigate that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.340" end="00:46:34.869" style="s2">as a broader populace that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.440" end="00:46:37.720" style="s2">necessarily sovereign Lewis sort that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.869" end="00:46:39.940" style="s2">motor sense making people learn most</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.720" end="00:46:41.260" style="s2">through emulation and they must learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.940" end="00:46:44.230" style="s2">best through emulation of other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.260" end="00:46:48.040" style="s2">who they feel sense not feel well feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.230" end="00:46:49.930" style="s2">are like them so the more diverse people</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.930" end="00:46:53.619" style="s2">like this one that could be seen and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.640" end="00:46:55.810" style="s2">perceived by other people the better</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.500" end="00:47:37.190" style="s2">step is watch one the second step is do</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.560" end="00:47:43.849" style="s2">iterate on that a widely distributed</p>

<p begin="00:47:56.510" end="00:48:01.069" style="s2">from that comes the next set of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.270" end="00:48:02.420" style="s2">imagine in those campfires people began</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.069" end="00:48:04.220" style="s2">inquiring into these kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.420" end="00:48:05.630" style="s2">and learning how to ask the best</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.630" end="00:48:08.290" style="s2">them in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.120" end="00:48:16.230" style="s2">okay so this is going to be the last</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.460" end="00:49:14.109" style="s2">slowing down knowing that the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.670" end="00:49:16.630" style="s2">thing to do is actually to get out of</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.950" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">very different kind of notion all right</p>
