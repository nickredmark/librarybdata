<p begin="00:01:36.260" end="00:01:40.550" style="s2">nonsense that Peterson has anything to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.060" end="00:01:42.440" style="s2">do with right-wing ideology or that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.550" end="00:01:44.290" style="s2">hates marginal people or that he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.440" end="00:01:47.000" style="s2">indifferent to the wealth distribution</p>

<p begin="00:01:50.510" end="00:01:54.530" style="s2">warm and compassionate in the interview</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.280" end="00:01:57.350" style="s2">contrary to his firebrand image and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.530" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">brand was not the bimbo he is described</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.350" end="00:02:04.580" style="s2">as by haters the conversation went well</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:06.260" style="s2">Peterson seemed in his element and was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.580" end="00:02:08.599" style="s2">less combative than one would expect</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.260" end="00:02:11.030" style="s2">there was much common ground touched on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.599" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in common ground between</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.030" end="00:02:15.830" style="s2">Peterson and the leftists for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.129" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">of reasons firstly Peterson&#39;s frontal</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.830" end="00:02:19.940" style="s2">attack on post-modernism and Marxism has</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.200" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">meant that a lot of leftist</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">missing out on him they have been duped</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:26.170" style="s2">into believing that Peterson is a sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.110" end="00:02:28.820" style="s2">of intellectual version of Trump a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">dangerous reactionary or conservative</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.820" end="00:02:33.830" style="s2">the thing is Peterson is not tribal he</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:35.620" style="s2">simply disturbs people because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.830" end="00:02:37.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know what box to put him in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.620" end="00:02:40.490" style="s2">sometimes he sounds like a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.910" end="00:02:42.830" style="s2">and at other times a centrist sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.490" end="00:02:44.990" style="s2">he has left his concerns at other times</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.830" end="00:02:47.570" style="s2">he is an evil capitalist in his own</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:50.300" style="s2">words and because he is has a far</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.570" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">ranging and nuanced view of humanity he</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.300" end="00:02:54.410" style="s2">is able to converse with all types this</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:02:58.220" style="s2">is one of the things that makes him so</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.410" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">valuable he has a genuine peacemaker can</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.220" end="00:03:03.230" style="s2">he actually help the left to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:04.790" style="s2">postmodern identity politics just as he</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.230" end="00:03:08.780" style="s2">has helped right-wingers move away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.790" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">the extremes Peterson has said the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.780" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">proper concern of the left is to provide</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">a political voice for the working class</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.150" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">these are not exactly the words of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">typical right-wing Republican today if</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:22.850" style="s2">you are unclassifiable you might get</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.920" style="s2">pilloried by the authoritarian leftists</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.850" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">even if you have the usual leftist</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.920" end="00:03:30.489" style="s2">concerns such as distribution of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:33.820" style="s2">health care exploitation of resources</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.870" end="00:03:47.959" style="s2">that is you might even be attacked if</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.739" end="00:03:49.660" style="s2">you suggest that for instance there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.959" end="00:03:52.730" style="s2">some biological and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.660" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">differences between men and women which</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.730" end="00:03:58.090" style="s2">should be a truism and even celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:04:00.230" style="s2">if one cares about diversity that is and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.090" end="00:04:02.209" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s case there isn&#39;t actually any</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.230" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">evidence for the nasty labels he is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:07.820" style="s2">branded with so as critics are grasping</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">for straws the haters need somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.820" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">hate and so the best they can do is call</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">racist epitaph forgetting that he is an</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">Peterson claims his lectures have</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.830" end="00:06:53.580" style="s2">brought thousands of people back from</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.270" end="00:06:56.520" style="s2">the abyss of the alt-right or white</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:58.169" style="s2">identity politics both Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.520" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">brand have been willing to take great</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.169" end="00:07:05.370" style="s2">personal risks and to dive into dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:06.870" style="s2">places in the service of humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.370" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">yet the two men are obviously very</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.870" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">different but in what way</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">let me put forward a seemingly crazy</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">metaphysical idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">Peterson embodies the male archetype and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">brand the female archetype bear with me</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:23.180" style="s2">for a moment let&#39;s just accept the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">that male and female characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.180" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">actually exist in gay-straight and yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:32.729" style="s2">even transgender people and are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:34.889" style="s2">merely a social construction that each</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.729" end="00:07:38.460" style="s2">person is a combination of those traits</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.889" end="00:07:40.590" style="s2">whether they be male or female let us</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.460" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">talk about sexual traits even at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:45.000" style="s2">risk of being called biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:48.659" style="s2">essentialists another nasty way to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.000" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">that biology is an illusion let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.659" end="00:07:52.550" style="s2">suspend our political agendas just for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.550" end="00:07:57.449" style="s2">obviously brand is much more feminine in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">style and attitude and Peterson is much</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.449" end="00:08:02.370" style="s2">more masculine brand looks like a 70s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:02.909" style="s2">rock star he could easily wear heels and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.370" end="00:08:05.400" style="s2">makeup</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.909" end="00:08:07.789" style="s2">Peterson reminds me of Jimmy Stewart the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.400" end="00:08:10.979" style="s2">gentleman archetype of the 1950&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.789" end="00:08:13.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying brand is not manly only</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.979" end="00:08:15.690" style="s2">that he is a gender bender to complicate</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.500" end="00:08:18.030" style="s2">the issue Peterson also has feminine</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.690" end="00:08:20.490" style="s2">characteristics a motherly compassion</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.030" end="00:08:22.770" style="s2">for young men for instance but that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.490" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">another matter gender is not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.770" end="00:08:29.370" style="s2">subject Peterson&#39;s insistence on logos</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:32.089" style="s2">or truth speech and brave sacrifice make</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.370" end="00:08:35.339" style="s2">a much more prototypically Apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.089" end="00:08:37.700" style="s2">brand is fluid in frenetic he can never</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.339" end="00:08:41.270" style="s2">stop moving or talking he is a Dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.700" end="00:08:43.740" style="s2">seducer shifting between male and female</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.270" end="00:08:46.740" style="s2">Peterson is all about verticality</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:49.829" style="s2">judgment clarity brand is about cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.740" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">consciousness and inclusivity the topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.829" end="00:08:54.029" style="s2">they discussed on the recent podcast</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:57.029" style="s2">also illustrates this male-female</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.029" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">dynamic while brand Wok&#39;s is on about</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.029" end="00:09:01.000" style="s2">motherly compassion for different tribes</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">Peterson insists</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.000" end="00:09:06.280" style="s2">judgment and discrimination Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:08.350" style="s2">pointed out that you can&#39;t have an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.280" end="00:09:10.780" style="s2">without judging yourself against it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.350" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">brand is all about empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.780" end="00:09:15.820" style="s2">universality to put it another way</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:17.880" style="s2">Peterson is vertically oriented he</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.820" end="00:09:21.010" style="s2">speaks about hierarchy brand is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.880" end="00:09:23.620" style="s2">horizontal he speaks about universality</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.010" end="00:09:25.870" style="s2">the to make very good dance partners</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.620" end="00:09:28.330" style="s2">energetically speaking they complement</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.870" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">each other it is more than interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.330" end="00:09:32.410" style="s2">that Peterson has become popular in part</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">through his intellectual dance with</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.410" end="00:09:37.260" style="s2">tricksters comedians and gender benders</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:39.820" style="s2">is there another irony here to explore</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.260" end="00:09:41.950" style="s2">how great it would be if more of such</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.820" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">opposite types would have such civil</p>
