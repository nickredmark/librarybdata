<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">topic today is sovereignty and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.980" end="00:02:25.940" style="s2">really takes us through both why</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:28.670" style="s2">sovereignty is needed to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.940" end="00:02:31.190" style="s2">from a potential apocalyptic event but</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.670" end="00:02:33.830" style="s2">also the three key elements of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.190" end="00:02:36.920" style="s2">sovereignty how one could really begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.830" end="00:02:38.690" style="s2">to get into a state of sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.920" end="00:02:40.790" style="s2">exactly what that means and feels like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.690" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">and then finally we close out with just</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.790" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">sort of me picking Jordans brain about</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:47.510" style="s2">the key obstacles to sovereignty talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.489" style="s2">about how government may get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.510" end="00:02:51.709" style="s2">and that really brings up items like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.489" end="00:02:53.750" style="s2">blockchain this conversation was both</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.709" end="00:02:56.360" style="s2">intellectually challenging as well as</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.750" end="00:02:58.370" style="s2">fun for me you&#39;ll see at times that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.360" end="00:03:00.739" style="s2">both processing and trying to ask</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:02.690" style="s2">questions at the same time in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.739" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">took so many notes that I&#39;ll try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.690" end="00:03:06.140" style="s2">condense them all into the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:09.590" style="s2">which can be found at decoding</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.460" end="00:04:45.530" style="s2">so this is a conversation I&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">forward to for a very long time actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.530" end="00:04:49.970" style="s2">because I&#39;ve had the chance to speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">with a couple people that you&#39;re close</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.970" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">with being Dan stickler and James from</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:57.860" style="s2">Ogden burger about this very topic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:01.610" style="s2">the topic today we&#39;re gonna get into is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.860" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">sovereignty but before that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:07.699" style="s2">ask you because I saw this video and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:09.530" style="s2">said that you&#39;re excited that Donald</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.699" end="00:05:12.259" style="s2">Trump got elected do you mind if I ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.530" end="00:05:15.229" style="s2">why all right so the me preface because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.259" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">by invoking sovereignty we first have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.229" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">make a little bit of room which is in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:21.259" style="s2">order to discuss sovereignty to do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:22.729" style="s2">right and well we actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.259" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">already begin the process of entering</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.729" end="00:05:26.300" style="s2">into it if that makes any sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:28.669" style="s2">it&#39;s not the kind of thing that you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.300" end="00:05:31.219" style="s2">stand outside of to look at you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.669" end="00:05:33.020" style="s2">actually enter into it one piece of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.219" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">which is becoming is understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.020" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">and the reason why I mentioned that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.300" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">that this question of Donald Trump has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">particular characteristic of shaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:45.949" style="s2">people out of their sovereignty and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:48.319" style="s2">if by virtue of entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.949" end="00:05:51.139" style="s2">conversation about Donald Trump you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.319" end="00:05:52.940" style="s2">shaken out of your sovereignty then well</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.139" end="00:05:55.569" style="s2">for one thing you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.940" end="00:05:57.770" style="s2">actually participate in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.569" end="00:05:59.719" style="s2">FairPoint great so now we&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.770" end="00:06:01.969" style="s2">three or four layers of recursion going</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.719" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">so think about that as a primary point</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.969" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">that if you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:09.770" style="s2">meaningfully actually consider anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:12.409" style="s2">and in particular meaningfully consider</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.770" end="00:06:15.979" style="s2">precisely those things that are the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.409" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">challenging to you and which will often</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.979" end="00:06:19.699" style="s2">show up while they&#39;re not exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">show up as controversial in the social</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.699" end="00:06:26.539" style="s2">milieu then you must be first and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">foremost very clear on how your</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.539" end="00:06:30.469" style="s2">sovereignty relates to the world that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:33.139" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with and so just keep</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">into a kind of a coarse grained</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.669" end="00:07:07.010" style="s2">why I can actually say that I was and am</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.750" end="00:07:09.949" style="s2">excited by the election of Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.010" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">is contextualized alright so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.949" end="00:07:15.380" style="s2">saying that from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">being a political partisan on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.380" end="00:07:18.919" style="s2">in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">I&#39;m contextualizing it at least two</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.919" end="00:07:23.630" style="s2">layers and probably three or four layers</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:25.160" style="s2">larger and so if anybody has spent any</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.630" end="00:07:27.950" style="s2">time looking at or listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.160" end="00:07:31.190" style="s2">kinds of things that I gauge in I take</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.950" end="00:07:33.410" style="s2">as a primary object civilization design</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.190" end="00:07:35.180" style="s2">so the evolution of civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.410" end="00:07:37.070" style="s2">then the degree to which we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.180" end="00:07:38.750" style="s2">engage in a conscious relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.070" end="00:07:40.130" style="s2">how civilization unfolds all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.750" end="00:07:42.530" style="s2">already at that point I&#39;ve already lost</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.130" end="00:07:44.660" style="s2">most people but that&#39;s important which</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.530" end="00:07:46.970" style="s2">is to recognize that we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.660" end="00:07:50.750" style="s2">embedded in a civilization we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.970" end="00:07:53.330" style="s2">embedded in a huge amount of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.750" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">we more or less just receive that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.330" end="00:07:58.099" style="s2">have very little consciousness of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.169" style="s2">actually been say developed how it came</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.099" end="00:08:02.690" style="s2">to be how it relates to us and how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.169" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">forms our ability to perceive and act in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.690" end="00:08:07.070" style="s2">the world and so that&#39;s a primary</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:10.250" style="s2">consideration particularly these days</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.070" end="00:08:12.500" style="s2">but one that I urge people to take is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.250" end="00:08:16.580" style="s2">recognize that we&#39;re fish and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.500" end="00:08:19.490" style="s2">water and that water is mostly of human</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:21.050" style="s2">creation and therefore it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.490" end="00:08:22.610" style="s2">we&#39;re playing a game and we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:23.930" style="s2">recognize that as kids the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.610" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">we can notice how the game works and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.930" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">then we can choose to begin considering</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:29.960" style="s2">different games we might want to play</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:31.250" style="s2">all the way down to the basic level</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.960" end="00:08:33.409" style="s2">there are certain things that are rock</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.250" end="00:08:34.430" style="s2">hard solid like the laws of physics that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.409" end="00:08:37.130" style="s2">we&#39;re probably not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.430" end="00:08:38.209" style="s2">play around with but a couple of levels</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.130" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">higher than that and it becomes pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.209" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">plastic okay so watching and monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">and observing the shape and flow of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">evolution of our civilization I then</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">notice the event of the 2016 election as</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.130" end="00:08:56.670" style="s2">one being particularly enter</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.690" style="s2">meaning that it actually represents a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.670" end="00:09:00.370" style="s2">well actually specifically what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.690" end="00:09:02.260" style="s2">a phase transition mm-hmm there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.370" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">something going on there that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.260" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">profound and important because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">happening at such a deep level almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">completely invisible to almost everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:14.890" style="s2">who is watching it at the wrong level</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">and and I think that if anybody is sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.890" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">of if you go back and rewind your mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:21.430" style="s2">to the point at which the election</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.750" end="00:09:23.170" style="s2">happens so if you can maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.430" end="00:09:25.000" style="s2">moment where that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:27.700" style="s2">interesting moment where the news mass</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.000" end="00:09:30.519" style="s2">media had to begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.700" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">shifting their narrative from inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.519" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">Clinton win to runoff oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:38.050" style="s2">unfortunate Trump win mm-hmm something</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:39.339" style="s2">happened at a at an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.050" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">collective level which I&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.339" end="00:09:43.149" style="s2">entering into a liminal space people</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">were disoriented most people not</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.149" end="00:09:45.790" style="s2">everyone but most people even the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">who are Trump supporters were</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.790" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">disoriented they were disoriented into</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:50.200" style="s2">euphoric direction but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:52.750" style="s2">something happened that was confusing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.200" end="00:09:55.240" style="s2">the model the framework the collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.750" end="00:09:57.370" style="s2">intelligence was surprised and it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.240" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">surprised in such a deep way that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.370" end="00:10:01.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how to resolve it surprise</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.769" style="s2">now we can run this actually at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.240" end="00:10:04.690" style="s2">point this this way of framing it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.769" end="00:10:06.760" style="s2">useful because we can actually run a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.690" end="00:10:09.250" style="s2">line which is to say that this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.760" end="00:10:11.800" style="s2">experience it happens at an individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.250" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">level as human beings we on occasion run</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.800" end="00:10:16.050" style="s2">into circumstances like this we find</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">ourselves in situations where our</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:23.800" style="s2">and feel confidently that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:26.199" style="s2">actually make good choices in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.800" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">environment gets blown up and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.199" end="00:10:31.000" style="s2">were confused and oftentimes very</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">quickly then have some emotion response</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.000" end="00:10:34.300" style="s2">to our confusion now usually usually</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:35.290" style="s2">Fiera they&#39;re not always but that sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.300" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">of thing happens at a collective level</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.290" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">as well right so awesome</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.180" end="00:10:40.839" style="s2">many many people at that particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">moment entered into a state of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.839" end="00:10:47.800" style="s2">individual liminality liminal space and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">in a collective liminality they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.800" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">even look around to find other people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:53.740" style="s2">give them orientation on what was a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:55.320" style="s2">framework I can look at that moment from</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.740" end="00:10:57.790" style="s2">two perspectives from one perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.320" end="00:10:59.410" style="s2">anything that does that anything that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.790" end="00:11:01.449" style="s2">generates that sense of individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.410" end="00:11:03.910" style="s2">collective liminality is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.449" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">powerful important because it is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.910" end="00:11:08.200" style="s2">liminality where we have the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:11.230" style="s2">and the possibility of the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.200" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">if we get upgrades in our technologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.230" end="00:11:14.440" style="s2">of sovereignty our capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:16.300" style="s2">sovereignty it also is by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.440" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">most places where we can have the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.300" end="00:11:19.180" style="s2">damage we could actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">biggest mistakes you know everything has</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.180" end="00:11:24.970" style="s2">moved now from solid into fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:27.310" style="s2">depending on how things play out it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.970" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">might solidify into something that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.310" end="00:11:30.670" style="s2">actually not a very good way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">right so it&#39;s it&#39;s a moment of distinct</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.670" end="00:11:37.510" style="s2">important and in this case it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:41.530" style="s2">just a called a stochastic or a random</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.510" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">or a just kind of event but actually it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.530" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">was it was itself a part of something</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">which requires it makes needful the</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.460" end="00:11:58.900" style="s2">developed through the 20th century and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.190" end="00:12:01.150" style="s2">frankly the world that developed through</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.900" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">most of civilization and I can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.150" end="00:12:06.400" style="s2">do this in stacks like there&#39;s 80 years</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:07.540" style="s2">since World War two but also the 500</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.540" end="00:12:11.170" style="s2">and also the 2,000 years since the</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.900" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2">and the transition is of that order of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.420" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">magnitude if not possibly larger so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.850" end="00:12:26.740" style="s2">witnessing at this moment a thing that</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.700" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">such magnitude and across so many levels</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.700" end="00:12:49.300" style="s2">that our ability to respond to it is</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.400" end="00:13:02.460" style="s2">are inadequate to the moment that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">find ourselves in and so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.460" end="00:13:08.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a phrase from philosophy that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:10.630" style="s2">like hopefully this event will awaken us</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.110" end="00:13:12.250" style="s2">from our dogmatic slumbers and in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.630" end="00:13:14.170" style="s2">being awakened from our dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.250" end="00:13:16.870" style="s2">slumbers we will find a way to enter</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.170" end="00:13:19.050" style="s2">into a new way of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.870" end="00:13:21.580" style="s2">relating to each other and coming into</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.050" end="00:13:21.970" style="s2">response to the world that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.580" end="00:13:23.349" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.970" end="00:13:26.529" style="s2">which the moment we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.349" end="00:13:29.049" style="s2">okay so Jordan if I if I understand this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.529" end="00:13:31.509" style="s2">correctly we&#39;re in this moment and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.049" end="00:13:35.470" style="s2">haven&#39;t resolidify debt right so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.509" end="00:13:37.809" style="s2">gone from solid to to liquid I guess</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.470" end="00:13:40.329" style="s2">first question is have we re solidified</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.809" end="00:13:42.459" style="s2">and then secondly I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.329" end="00:13:44.289" style="s2">other things that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.459" end="00:13:45.789" style="s2">say before is that we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.289" end="00:13:49.479" style="s2">transition that could potentially kill</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.789" end="00:13:51.249" style="s2">us all what events what technologies do</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.479" end="00:13:53.919" style="s2">you think could lead to that and how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.249" end="00:13:55.959" style="s2">we avoid it okay well okay you actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.919" end="00:13:58.179" style="s2">asked two questions both of which were</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.959" end="00:14:00.609" style="s2">profound I&#39;ll try to take them in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.179" end="00:14:02.109" style="s2">if I if I lose the thread just remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.609" end="00:14:03.909" style="s2">the second question and we can come back</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.109" end="00:14:07.029" style="s2">to it okay all right so the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.909" end="00:14:09.429" style="s2">question what&#39;s interesting and again I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.029" end="00:14:11.739" style="s2">I find it delightful though I understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.429" end="00:14:15.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s very painful is that many</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.739" end="00:14:16.749" style="s2">people endeavor to solidify and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.039" end="00:14:18.849" style="s2">solidify too quickly so I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.749" end="00:14:20.470" style="s2">example a very concrete example there</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.849" end="00:14:22.029" style="s2">was an effort after like within the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.470" end="00:14:24.129" style="s2">first month after the election to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.029" end="00:14:25.989" style="s2">sense of the event and to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.129" end="00:14:29.319" style="s2">the event in the most banal way possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.989" end="00:14:31.629" style="s2">meaning to change as little as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.319" end="00:14:33.639" style="s2">the way that you previously made sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.629" end="00:14:35.439" style="s2">of the world and still try to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.639" end="00:14:35.739" style="s2">of the event I think of any number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.439" end="00:14:37.119" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.739" end="00:14:38.679" style="s2">a Russian hacking I think is the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.119" end="00:14:41.019" style="s2">enduring one and which what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.679" end="00:14:42.699" style="s2">interesting is that each of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.019" end="00:14:44.769" style="s2">forming structures you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.699" end="00:14:46.299" style="s2">almost like crystals in magma</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.769" end="00:14:49.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s solidification but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.299" end="00:14:52.629" style="s2">initially almost like snowflakes funny I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.359" end="00:14:56.769" style="s2">didn&#39;t yeah they&#39;re actually like</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.629" end="00:14:58.119" style="s2">snowflakes that in the physics that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.769" end="00:15:00.129" style="s2">they&#39;re as they&#39;re growing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.119" end="00:15:01.299" style="s2">building resilience but in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.129" end="00:15:03.699" style="s2">they&#39;re actually still very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.299" end="00:15:05.829" style="s2">mm-hm the tectonic shifts of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.699" end="00:15:09.669" style="s2">what we&#39;re going into continues to break</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.829" end="00:15:12.189" style="s2">them so while there has been a decided</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.669" end="00:15:15.159" style="s2">effort to close ones eyes and not</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.189" end="00:15:17.470" style="s2">actually think about what&#39;s going on to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.159" end="00:15:19.299" style="s2">stay deeply embedded in a increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.470" end="00:15:21.639" style="s2">dysfunctional delusional framework of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.299" end="00:15:23.409" style="s2">sense making the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.639" end="00:15:26.439" style="s2">circumstances have continued you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.409" end="00:15:28.749" style="s2">break that up so I find that many people</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.439" end="00:15:30.159" style="s2">even those people who move steadfastly</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.749" end="00:15:31.989" style="s2">endeavor to bury their heads in the sand</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.159" end="00:15:33.489" style="s2">are just finding that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.989" end="00:15:35.740" style="s2">dragged kicking and screaming into</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.489" end="00:15:36.670" style="s2">having to recognize that okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.740" end="00:15:38.230" style="s2">just gonna have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.670" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">something&#39;s going on that is deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.230" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">just the stories that I could make up</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:44.440" style="s2">and I think that like the entire arc of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:47.620" style="s2">the past two years has been a great</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.440" end="00:15:50.650" style="s2">example of that every time a prefab</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.620" end="00:15:53.620" style="s2">mechanism for endeavoring to heal the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.650" end="00:15:55.030" style="s2">break has come up it has lasted only I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.620" end="00:15:57.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know days weeks maybe months</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.030" end="00:15:59.530" style="s2">before it&#39;s been turned under it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.460" end="00:16:01.540" style="s2">nice process where you know at some</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.530" end="00:16:02.980" style="s2">point somebody just has to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.540" end="00:16:05.740" style="s2">that that&#39;s an unpleasant place to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.980" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">and step back and say okay oh I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.740" end="00:16:07.690" style="s2">don&#39;t want to play in that washing</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:10.120" style="s2">machine anymore</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.690" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s going on and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.120" end="00:16:13.960" style="s2">more and more and more people have made</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.830" end="00:16:16.690" style="s2">that have made that recognition at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.960" end="00:16:18.700" style="s2">basal level and at a physical level</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.690" end="00:16:20.050" style="s2">really and then have made the choice to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.700" end="00:16:21.760" style="s2">step back and wonder what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.050" end="00:16:24.130" style="s2">going on and so of course what happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.760" end="00:16:26.470" style="s2">is that as fewer people participate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.130" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">the mass delusion the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.470" end="00:16:29.950" style="s2">mass delusion to just keep pulling</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:32.020" style="s2">people under weakens so we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.950" end="00:16:33.760" style="s2">beginning to accelerate towards having</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.020" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">our together which is good news in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.760" end="00:16:36.430" style="s2">spite of the fact that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:37.690" style="s2">unpleasant right this is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.430" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">a pleasant thing this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.690" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">deeply deeply distressful thing as all</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:43.840" style="s2">moments of liminality are okay did that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:46.750" style="s2">feel like that was a good response to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.840" end="00:16:48.640" style="s2">your first question it did moving on to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.750" end="00:16:50.110" style="s2">the second one where we have all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.640" end="00:16:52.510" style="s2">these people that are accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.110" end="00:16:55.090" style="s2">towards having their together so to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.510" end="00:16:56.470" style="s2">speak and there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.090" end="00:16:57.940" style="s2">potential transition and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.470" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">something greater but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.940" end="00:17:01.990" style="s2">things that could screw it up and could</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:04.300" style="s2">kill us all what do you see is some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.990" end="00:17:09.010" style="s2">those potential obstacles whether it be</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.300" end="00:17:10.690" style="s2">technology politicians people etc so at</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.010" end="00:17:11.890" style="s2">this point we&#39;ve been doing this long</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.690" end="00:17:15.100" style="s2">enough that I hopefully what I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.890" end="00:17:18.250" style="s2">to request has some heads to it or some</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.100" end="00:17:20.620" style="s2">it feels solid in order to respond well</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.250" end="00:17:22.120" style="s2">to the question that you asked I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.620" end="00:17:25.240" style="s2">have to actually construct something</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.120" end="00:17:27.910" style="s2">which is not simple and so the request</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.240" end="00:17:29.590" style="s2">is to actually listen and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.910" end="00:17:31.030" style="s2">that mean Lee what I mean is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.590" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to listen to something</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.030" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">which is not simple but to be curious</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:36.670" style="s2">about what I&#39;m trying to construct and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:38.740" style="s2">may be allowed to build out before</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.670" end="00:17:40.330" style="s2">thinking that it it makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.740" end="00:17:42.370" style="s2">it won&#39;t make sense for a while I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.330" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">think okay so because the there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.370" end="00:17:45.040" style="s2">bunch of different pieces that it all</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">kind of fit together so let&#39;s start it</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.040" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">just technology and I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:51.400" style="s2">fully obvious but</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.890" style="s2">pretty clear that somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.400" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">middle of the 1950&#39;s as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.890" end="00:17:59.320" style="s2">invention of the atomic bomb the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:18:02.049" style="s2">species entered into a historically</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.049" end="00:18:07.150" style="s2">the middle of the 1950&#39;s try as we might</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:09.970" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t really get up that badly</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.150" end="00:18:11.799" style="s2">World War two was bad but it barely made</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.970" end="00:18:13.660" style="s2">a dent in the population of humans on</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.799" end="00:18:14.830" style="s2">the planet even really significant</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.660" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">natural events like the black death</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.830" end="00:18:18.700" style="s2">which were really really bad still</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:20.200" style="s2">barely made a dent on the population of</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.390" end="00:18:54.100" style="s2">true we&#39;re talking about a situation</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:03.909" style="s2">all right now what&#39;s important after</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:06.490" style="s2">that point is to recognize that why that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.909" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">happened was that we had reached a level</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.490" end="00:19:13.030" style="s2">of ability a level of our own power in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:15.070" style="s2">relationship to the world that itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.030" end="00:19:18.309" style="s2">was unprecedented we had built a</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.309" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">power into the world that was new and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.580" end="00:19:25.419" style="s2">had done that because our own ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">invent ways to deliver power had</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.419" end="00:19:28.990" style="s2">continued to accelerate we should say</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:33.400" style="s2">science and technology so we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.990" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">from swords to arrows to guns to bomb</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.400" end="00:19:37.059" style="s2">well bombs actually predated guns but to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">bigger bombs to bigger bombs there</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.059" end="00:19:41.169" style="s2">suddenly bombs that were insane and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.760" end="00:19:42.580" style="s2">penetrating the deepest recesses the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.169" end="00:19:45.669" style="s2">laws of physics to be able to get there</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.580" end="00:19:49.240" style="s2">well okay that hasn&#39;t stopped right the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.669" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">the the process of our ability to know</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.240" end="00:19:55.240" style="s2">the world and change the world because</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">of by virtue or use of our will has</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.240" end="00:20:00.190" style="s2">continued and it in fact has continued</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">to accelerate so in just to make it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.190" end="00:20:05.770" style="s2">simple in 1945 we entered into a new era</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:08.170" style="s2">where we had a capacity to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.770" end="00:20:10.930" style="s2">everything but at a tiny tiny fraction</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.170" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">in this case the inverse of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.930" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">in that case only two people had the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">possibility of doing that meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:17.340" style="s2">the President of the United States that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:19.540" style="s2">and the premier the Soviet Union but</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.340" end="00:20:21.940" style="s2">because Science and Technology have</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.540" end="00:20:24.070" style="s2">continued to advance we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.940" end="00:20:26.500" style="s2">continued to fill the gaps so now we</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.070" end="00:20:28.600" style="s2">have entered we have the democratization</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.500" end="00:20:30.910" style="s2">of the technologies of extinction is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.600" end="00:20:32.170" style="s2">maybe a way of thinking about it and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:34.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;ve reached out but</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.170" end="00:20:37.300" style="s2">just just take nuclear proliferation as</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.180" end="00:20:40.870" style="s2">a simple example I went from two to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.300" end="00:20:42.250" style="s2">seven and we&#39;re now kind of entering</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.870" end="00:20:43.780" style="s2">into a moment where the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.250" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">the biggest experts of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.780" end="00:20:47.580" style="s2">proliferation of said look our ability</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:49.870" style="s2">to keep this thing contained is</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.580" end="00:20:51.030" style="s2">decelerating like the likelihood that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.870" end="00:20:53.860" style="s2">some point we&#39;re going to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.030" end="00:20:56.530" style="s2">nuclear power in the hands of something</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">which is at a level lower than a great</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.530" end="00:21:01.630" style="s2">state is pretty likely and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">find somebody somewhere who&#39;s maybe say</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.630" end="00:21:04.990" style="s2">a multinational corporation has</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.700" style="s2">developed nuclear power maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.990" end="00:21:08.170" style="s2">next 10-15 years and it doesn&#39;t be a car</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.700" end="00:21:09.250" style="s2">it could be a terrorist organization to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.170" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">give you a rogue state it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.250" end="00:21:12.250" style="s2">the point is we&#39;ve entered into a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.200" style="s2">phase and that new phase it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.250" end="00:21:17.050" style="s2">linear thing it&#39;s just it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.200" end="00:21:19.090" style="s2">get two to seven people to kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.050" end="00:21:20.830" style="s2">balance but thirty people is a totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.090" end="00:21:22.690" style="s2">different game and the game theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.830" end="00:21:24.040" style="s2">starts to unravel pretty quickly nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.690" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">power is only one variable you know with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.040" end="00:21:28.990" style="s2">things like CRISPR the ability to engage</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:33.070" style="s2">in the construction of genetic and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.990" end="00:21:34.900" style="s2">bioengineering is very rapidly and much</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.070" end="00:21:36.130" style="s2">less controllably going to be entering</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.900" end="00:21:37.540" style="s2">into the social environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.130" end="00:21:40.210" style="s2">single-digit millions of people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.540" end="00:21:41.470" style="s2">going to have a level of power that in</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.180" end="00:21:55.510" style="s2">way because we are actually binding the</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:15.940" style="s2">okay we could do other ones I can just</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.470" end="00:22:16.810" style="s2">keep keep making them up let&#39;s try</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.800" end="00:22:28.330" style="s2">a moment right at the edge of</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.330" end="00:22:31.180" style="s2">it&#39;s at the edge and the reason this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.830" end="00:22:32.860" style="s2">list zoom in on that because I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.180" end="00:22:34.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a good way for people to grasp we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.860" end="00:22:38.140" style="s2">have to understand things in the context</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.780" end="00:22:40.390" style="s2">of how the dynamics reinforce themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.140" end="00:22:42.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s escape velocity it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.390" end="00:22:44.620" style="s2">things get out of hand that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.610" end="00:22:46.600" style="s2">to travel so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.620" end="00:22:49.690" style="s2">really really really good video that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.600" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">put out on swarms of killer drones I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.690" end="00:22:53.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t at the top of mind it can&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:55.150" style="s2">it right now but maybe afterwards I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.860" end="00:22:57.130" style="s2">could find it and send it to you can I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.150" end="00:22:59.620" style="s2">can link to it in the show notes but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.130" end="00:23:02.200" style="s2">the basic premise is it shows a world</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.620" end="00:23:05.380" style="s2">that is extremely feasible like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.200" end="00:23:06.460" style="s2">exists tomorrow where autonomous little</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.550" end="00:23:18.820" style="s2">surprised I&#39;m sure it actually does</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.900" end="00:23:20.230" style="s2">exist so I could create a drone and I</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.390" end="00:23:25.810" style="s2">and I could code it to be aware of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.120" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a co-evolutionary dynamic that</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">dynamics if you and I are in competition</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.170" end="00:24:08.620" style="s2">on an exponential feel alright so if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:10.840" style="s2">and I are in competition and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.620" end="00:24:13.420" style="s2">ahead of me on that competition on an</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.840" end="00:24:16.420" style="s2">exponential curve your advantage is so</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.420" end="00:24:18.610" style="s2">significant that I have to engage in all</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.420" end="00:24:20.920" style="s2">kinds of effort to catch up and get</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.610" end="00:24:25.090" style="s2">ahead of you otherwise I&#39;m an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.920" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">risk well I do right I do engage in all</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.090" end="00:24:28.060" style="s2">kinds of efforts to catch up with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:30.580" style="s2">which means that I&#39;m going to do things</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.060" end="00:24:32.440" style="s2">like not be careful I mean I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.580" end="00:24:34.179" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be willing to do things that</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.179" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have made the choose choice to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.580" style="s2">do well now if I get ahead of you in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:42.100" style="s2">that in that race and I&#39;ve pushed the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.580" end="00:24:44.289" style="s2">curve now further out I&#39;ve invented some</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.100" end="00:24:46.059" style="s2">new thing that was not in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.289" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">by virtue of inventing it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.059" end="00:24:49.929" style="s2">hard to invent things it&#39;s easy to copy</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:51.880" style="s2">things I&#39;ve now moved the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.929" end="00:24:53.649" style="s2">possibility forward a little bit but now</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.880" end="00:24:55.870" style="s2">everybody&#39;s in competition with me can</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.649" end="00:24:57.340" style="s2">copy that and that&#39;s the new fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.870" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the new baseline so now in order</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.340" end="00:25:00.519" style="s2">to be able to be in competition we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:02.580" style="s2">all seeking new innovations this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.519" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">almost like the dangerous version of</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.260" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">enormous benefit that the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.450" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">innovation is actually where all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:15.220" style="s2">interesting stuff happens once I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:16.389" style="s2">innovated something for a little limited</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.220" end="00:25:18.309" style="s2">period of time I have a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.389" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">advantage but everybody in the world now</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.309" end="00:25:21.549" style="s2">has is the ability to see that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:22.990" style="s2">invented it copying is easier than</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.549" end="00:25:24.549" style="s2">inventing so they can catch up with me</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.990" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">they&#39;re motivated to do so because if</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.549" end="00:25:28.299" style="s2">they don&#39;t they&#39;ve got competitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.980" style="s2">disadvantage and so the entire economy</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.299" end="00:25:31.299" style="s2">now moves to this new threshold so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.980" end="00:25:32.529" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.299" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">certain kinds of things from the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.529" end="00:25:35.620" style="s2">of view of weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">is really nasty so that&#39;s the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.620" end="00:25:40.330" style="s2">it&#39;s the the combination of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">intrinsic dynamics of innovation is hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.330" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">to do copying is easy to do and a rival</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.269" style="s2">risk game theory we&#39;re always in</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.269" end="00:25:49.809" style="s2">and the field of innovation is</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.830" end="00:25:51.220" style="s2">exponential power we&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.809" end="00:25:53.230" style="s2">if you actually run the history line</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.220" end="00:25:54.789" style="s2">back the reason why nuclear weapons were</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.230" end="00:25:57.519" style="s2">developed was because we were concerned</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.789" end="00:25:59.320" style="s2">that the Nazis were ahead of us on</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.519" end="00:26:01.000" style="s2">nuclear weapons so we were willing</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.320" end="00:26:02.470" style="s2">to engage in the massive investment of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.000" end="00:26:03.970" style="s2">the Manhattan Project and move the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.470" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">of innovation forward which we did</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.970" end="00:26:08.260" style="s2">enormous Lee and in about two years the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:09.909" style="s2">Soviet Union figured out how to copy it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.260" end="00:26:11.799" style="s2">all right wow that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.909" end="00:26:14.289" style="s2">moral of the story run that same story</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.799" end="00:26:16.750" style="s2">against every other possible field of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.289" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">destruction and across the nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.750" end="00:26:20.740" style="s2">levels of creativity that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:22.570" style="s2">happen to have and you find yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.740" end="00:26:25.630" style="s2">a circumstance where the democratization</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.570" end="00:26:27.850" style="s2">of weapons of mass extinction is where</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.630" end="00:26:29.799" style="s2">we&#39;re at kind of now like right now and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.850" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">accelerating over the next two or three</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.799" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">decades we&#39;re just going to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:36.309" style="s2">run into circumstances where we&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">from a point where two people have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.309" end="00:26:40.840" style="s2">choose not to turn a key at the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">time to a point where every single human</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.840" end="00:26:43.810" style="s2">being has to affirmatively know how not</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:45.880" style="s2">to make bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.810" end="00:26:47.620" style="s2">decisions lest we in fact kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.880" end="00:26:49.660" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.620" end="00:26:51.490" style="s2">problem to me this is brilliant Thank</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.660" end="00:26:53.560" style="s2">You Jordan so we all need to develop</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.490" end="00:26:55.390" style="s2">ways to learn how to not kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.560" end="00:26:57.790" style="s2">right and I guess this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.390" end="00:27:01.660" style="s2">appropriate transition into the concept</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.790" end="00:27:03.430" style="s2">of sovereignty yeah and really just sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.660" end="00:27:06.220" style="s2">of because some of the audience may have</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.430" end="00:27:07.780" style="s2">heard you speak but also others speak on</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.220" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">this concept of sovereignty but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.780" end="00:27:13.060" style="s2">some have not do you mind just going</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.390" end="00:27:14.680" style="s2">into first what is sovereignty real</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.060" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">quick and just sort of the three</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.680" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2">components of that sovereignty at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:21.580" style="s2">basic level sovereignty is your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.150" end="00:27:23.770" style="s2">to respond to the world and when I say</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.580" end="00:27:26.260" style="s2">respond I&#39;m distinguishing that from</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.770" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">react and a good metaphor for this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.260" end="00:27:30.580" style="s2">the notion of balance if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:32.230" style="s2">let&#39;s just say a fighter like a boxer in</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.580" end="00:27:34.270" style="s2">the beginning let&#39;s imagine that our</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.230" end="00:27:37.030" style="s2">boxer is poised meaning that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.270" end="00:27:39.940" style="s2">standing well balanced that his ability</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.030" end="00:27:42.040" style="s2">to shift what he&#39;s doing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.940" end="00:27:45.250" style="s2">very high you know and he can read and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.040" end="00:27:48.010" style="s2">respond and when he responds the action</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:50.230" style="s2">that he takes keeps him in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.010" end="00:27:53.080" style="s2">being able to respond so right is my</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.230" end="00:27:55.570" style="s2">movement increases my ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.080" end="00:27:57.820" style="s2">better choices in the next moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.570" end="00:27:59.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what response means every choice</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.820" end="00:28:02.020" style="s2">you make has the characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.500" end="00:28:04.450" style="s2">increasing your ability to make good</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.020" end="00:28:07.060" style="s2">choices in the next moment when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.450" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">react it has the opposite characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.060" end="00:28:12.100" style="s2">it moves you out of balance so you make</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.490" end="00:28:14.590" style="s2">a choice that choice changes your</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.100" end="00:28:16.150" style="s2">relationship to the world such that your</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.590" end="00:28:19.870" style="s2">ability to make your next choice is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.150" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">actually lower and so I&#39;m a boxer I make</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.870" end="00:28:24.730" style="s2">a really strong like I swing hard well</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:26.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve made a significant commitment</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.730" end="00:28:29.020" style="s2">meaning I&#39;ve moved out of balance</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.730" end="00:28:31.750" style="s2">literally physically you know I&#39;m out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.020" end="00:28:34.810" style="s2">balance I&#39;m over hope my wait is over as</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.750" end="00:28:36.940" style="s2">uncertain spot if it turns out that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.810" end="00:28:39.400" style="s2">choice didn&#39;t work out I&#39;m now actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.940" end="00:28:42.160" style="s2">quite significantly less capable of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.400" end="00:28:43.780" style="s2">responding to what my opponent does for</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.160" end="00:28:45.460" style="s2">quite for a significant period of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.780" end="00:28:48.070" style="s2">and so what I have to do at that point</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.460" end="00:28:49.450" style="s2">is get myself back into balance so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.070" end="00:28:52.420" style="s2">you notice the way boxers move is they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.450" end="00:28:54.250" style="s2">they make small imbalance movements</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.420" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">really significantly reading and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.250" end="00:28:57.400" style="s2">responding and staying in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:59.140" style="s2">high response and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.400" end="00:29:02.500" style="s2">and only when they&#39;re willing to make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.140" end="00:29:04.510" style="s2">gamble do they make a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.500" end="00:29:05.860" style="s2">takes them out of balance and very</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.510" end="00:29:08.410" style="s2">quickly try to move back into balance</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.860" end="00:29:09.820" style="s2">right that&#39;s a really good metaphor if</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.410" end="00:29:13.090" style="s2">you don&#39;t like combat if that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.820" end="00:29:17.080" style="s2">feel sad first notice that that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.090" end="00:29:18.580" style="s2">very fact is a response to the world we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.080" end="00:29:19.660" style="s2">can do it with surfing surfing does the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.580" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">same thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.660" end="00:29:23.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to flow in a movement of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:25.300" style="s2">objective reality which is complex and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.680" end="00:29:28.540" style="s2">difficult and over which you have very</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.300" end="00:29:30.820" style="s2">little control no control really except</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.540" end="00:29:32.710" style="s2">your ability to actually shift and move</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.820" end="00:29:34.900" style="s2">your balance so that you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.710" end="00:29:37.450" style="s2">in this really amazing relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.900" end="00:29:39.280" style="s2">reality where your choices continue to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.450" end="00:29:41.020" style="s2">upgrade your capacity to make choices</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.280" end="00:29:43.720" style="s2">and that by the way that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.020" end="00:29:45.430" style="s2">distinction between a and novice and an</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.720" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">expert surfer and if you watch the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.430" end="00:29:50.170" style="s2">an expert surfer move they have this</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">amazing ability to almost fly across the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.170" end="00:29:54.850" style="s2">way that every move they make actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:55.990" style="s2">increases the potential of the next move</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.850" end="00:29:58.390" style="s2">and every once in a while they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.990" end="00:30:00.730" style="s2">explode into a flurry of something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.390" end="00:30:01.900" style="s2">then decreases their potential but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.730" end="00:30:03.550" style="s2">of course they immediately have to come</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.900" end="00:30:05.500" style="s2">back in so then sovereignty is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.550" end="00:30:06.850" style="s2">better to respond to the world it turns</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.500" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">out that there are three basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.850" end="00:30:10.390" style="s2">components of what that means and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:12.400" style="s2">should mention by the way that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.390" end="00:30:13.960" style="s2">mean control the world I mean respond to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.400" end="00:30:16.420" style="s2">be in relationship with in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.960" end="00:30:18.850" style="s2">fundamentally collaborative and to allow</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.420" end="00:30:20.380" style="s2">the generative of the creative aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.850" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">being relationship with reality to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.380" end="00:30:26.830" style="s2">emerge so the first aspect is perception</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:29.170" style="s2">the second aspect is what I call sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.830" end="00:30:31.300" style="s2">making and meaning making and I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.170" end="00:30:33.940" style="s2">a hand off it&#39;s it&#39;s converting</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.300" end="00:30:36.250" style="s2">perception into sense which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.940" end="00:30:38.410" style="s2">raw input into something you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.250" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">actually make sense of and all renting</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.410" end="00:30:42.790" style="s2">that sense around like notions of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.860" style="s2">the hell&#39;s going on and then converting</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.790" end="00:30:47.920" style="s2">that sense into Meeny which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.860" end="00:30:50.500" style="s2">into meaningful ways that one can</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.920" end="00:30:52.270" style="s2">actually respond to what&#39;s happening a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.500" end="00:30:53.890" style="s2">hand on the hand off into action and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.270" end="00:30:55.930" style="s2">then finally this actual action the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.890" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">choosing how to act and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.930" end="00:31:00.460" style="s2">execution of that action in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:02.200" style="s2">elegantly and skillfully as as you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.460" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a feedback loop right now you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.200" end="00:31:06.190" style="s2">have entered into you&#39;ve entered back</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:07.750" style="s2">into reality reality will do what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.190" end="00:31:09.970" style="s2">does with whatever the hell you did and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:11.170" style="s2">then you will be able to perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.970" end="00:31:12.790" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.170" end="00:31:13.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a constant flow and by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.790" end="00:31:15.820" style="s2">should mention it&#39;s a complex flow</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.960" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s actually stuff coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.820" end="00:31:19.540" style="s2">back the other direction that your</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:22.810" style="s2">disposition on how it is that you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.540" end="00:31:24.910" style="s2">are acting has consequences for your</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.810" end="00:31:27.520" style="s2">perception right if I&#39;m in a fight if</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.910" end="00:31:29.320" style="s2">I&#39;m if I&#39;m in a combat stance I&#39;m tuning</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.520" end="00:31:31.300" style="s2">myself to proceed I will perceive</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.320" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">threats more often if I happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.300" end="00:31:35.980" style="s2">been startled and somebody comes up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:37.780" style="s2">me I&#39;m much more likely to perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.980" end="00:31:39.970" style="s2">as a potential threat than a potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.780" end="00:31:42.250" style="s2">opportunity then if I am in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.970" end="00:31:45.010" style="s2">complete calm they could both go both</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.250" end="00:31:47.140" style="s2">directions and is extremely complex but</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.010" end="00:31:49.300" style="s2">nonetheless that&#39;s a simple framework to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.140" end="00:31:50.800" style="s2">kind of begin the process of grasping it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.300" end="00:31:52.990" style="s2">do you mind if we do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.800" end="00:31:54.760" style="s2">deeper dive on some of these because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.990" end="00:31:57.010" style="s2">think just looking at all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.760" end="00:31:59.800" style="s2">we can spend hours on this right if</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.010" end="00:32:01.570" style="s2">somebody wanted to really get a grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.800" end="00:32:03.940" style="s2">the model of sovereignty and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.570" end="00:32:06.850" style="s2">start to think how they could apply this</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.940" end="00:32:09.970" style="s2">to themselves starting with perception I</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.850" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">mean obviously you can do the observing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.970" end="00:32:14.500" style="s2">of what you&#39;re observing but what what</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:17.140" style="s2">are some of the ways that somebody could</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">start to like just start with perception</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.140" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">and really understand sovereignty the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">sovereignty model a little bit more I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.190" style="s2">imagine you might have noticed that on</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:26.110" style="s2">occasion I&#39;ve actually closed my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.190" end="00:32:30.520" style="s2">mm-hmm and that&#39;s an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.110" end="00:32:32.230" style="s2">peace perception is actually much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.520" end="00:32:34.990" style="s2">than I think we oftentimes give it</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.230" end="00:32:37.990" style="s2">credit for our bodies and our minds and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.990" end="00:32:40.510" style="s2">the combinations have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.990" end="00:32:42.100" style="s2">ways of sensing the world I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.510" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">gonna use a very rough term I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.100" end="00:32:47.530" style="s2">call it feelings but by feelings I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">for example the feeling that guides you</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.530" end="00:32:52.030" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to get a lens into</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.770" style="s2">focus or the feeling that guides you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.030" end="00:32:55.960" style="s2">when you&#39;re driving a motorcycle to stay</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.770" end="00:32:58.180" style="s2">in balance feeling that guides you when</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.960" end="00:32:59.980" style="s2">you are shooting a basketball such that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.180" end="00:33:01.810" style="s2">you actually hit the basketball right</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.980" end="00:33:03.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a pre-reception</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.810" end="00:33:06.190" style="s2">you know how you know when your body is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.370" end="00:33:08.590" style="s2">in balance there&#39;s the underlying sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:09.970" style="s2">of all the ways that your physiological</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.590" end="00:33:11.560" style="s2">systems are responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.970" end="00:33:14.530" style="s2">possibility space of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.560" end="00:33:17.260" style="s2">right so hey do I feel a certain like</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.530" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">tension okay what does that mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.260" end="00:33:21.340" style="s2">point being that you&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:23.020" style="s2">evolved sensors let&#39;s just call them</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.340" end="00:33:24.700" style="s2">sensors and there&#39;s lots of them like</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.020" end="00:33:25.060" style="s2">thousands and tens of thousands and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.700" end="00:33:26.710" style="s2">entered</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.060" end="00:33:29.110" style="s2">complex relationships with each other so</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.710" end="00:33:34.920" style="s2">there&#39;s billions of potentials that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.110" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">all dedicated to perceiving reality and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.920" end="00:33:41.260" style="s2">converting that into sense and it is no</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">small feat to endeavor to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.260" end="00:33:48.670" style="s2">actually perceive all of them and allow</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">them to enter into a very clear sensing</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.670" end="00:33:52.210" style="s2">I mean me a simple way of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:33:53.770" style="s2">especially my dad my dad was a fighter</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.210" end="00:33:56.380" style="s2">pilot so he taught me that this is one</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.770" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">of the things fighter pilots do is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.380" end="00:34:00.160" style="s2">can do this with just vision and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of sort of allowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.160" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">yourself to be envision where your</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.770" end="00:34:07.810" style="s2">ability to perceive your visual field</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:09.370" style="s2">goes way up hunters like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.810" end="00:34:11.320" style="s2">hunting in the forest this happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.370" end="00:34:12.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowing yourself to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.320" end="00:34:15.010" style="s2">you know what&#39;s happening you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.700" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">allowing yourself to be very very like</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.010" end="00:34:20.919" style="s2">nuanced and sensitive to subtlety in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:22.450" style="s2">just your visual field and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.919" end="00:34:24.490" style="s2">can then do that even more broadly you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.450" end="00:34:25.659" style="s2">can be sensitive to subtlety in you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.490" end="00:34:27.190" style="s2">the normal perceptual field we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.659" end="00:34:29.020" style="s2">talking like just hearing insight that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.190" end="00:34:30.250" style="s2">how you do something like hunting like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.020" end="00:34:32.530" style="s2">if you want to know if you want to find</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.250" end="00:34:35.890" style="s2">prey out in the in the forest you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.530" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">to become very very sensitive to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.890" end="00:34:39.250" style="s2">kind of thing but then the interior if</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.659" end="00:34:41.080" style="s2">the interior signals are even more</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.250" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">subtle now particularly these days</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.080" end="00:34:44.500" style="s2">because we live in such a noisy world</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">and we do such a terrible job of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.500" end="00:34:49.270" style="s2">training people to not pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:51.880" style="s2">their interior landscape that things</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.270" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">that our normal human stuff we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.880" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">very very separated from honestly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.450" style="s2">this is actually on but it&#39;s honestly</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:00.850" style="s2">the case for most people the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.450" end="00:35:02.140" style="s2">bang for the buck in terms of building</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.850" end="00:35:04.810" style="s2">sovereignty is actually at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.140" end="00:35:08.370" style="s2">perceptual level is actually engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.810" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">practices where they relearn</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.370" end="00:35:15.340" style="s2">skillfulness in sensitively noticing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:16.990" style="s2">subtle signals that come from all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.340" end="00:35:18.820" style="s2">various modes of sensing that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.990" end="00:35:21.070" style="s2">actually come into possession and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.820" end="00:35:22.570" style="s2">they relearn a way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.070" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">relationship with those subtle signals</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">clearly I&#39;ll give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.530" end="00:35:30.570" style="s2">where that fails the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2">that perception generates a aversion</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.349" end="00:36:17.210" style="s2">does is it shifts the nature of our</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.849" end="00:37:03.109" style="s2">small changes and what I would call your</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.660" end="00:37:11.029" style="s2">all right so to recapitulate you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.210" end="00:37:12.859" style="s2">a reinvention or a rediscovering of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.029" end="00:37:14.779" style="s2">are in fact natural ambient capacities</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.859" end="00:37:16.369" style="s2">to just even notice that these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.779" end="00:37:18.589" style="s2">are happening and then you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.369" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">developing skillfulness to allow those</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.589" end="00:37:22.190" style="s2">things that you&#39;ve now noticed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:24.859" style="s2">discovered to become clear what do they</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:27.289" style="s2">mean then you&#39;ve got a developing</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:30.319" style="s2">capacity to allow these things to become</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.289" end="00:37:32.569" style="s2">coherent to allow the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.319" end="00:37:36.589" style="s2">between among all the distinct signals</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.569" end="00:37:38.799" style="s2">to enter into a single signal that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.589" end="00:37:40.609" style="s2">actually a really high-quality</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.799" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">representation of them all that make</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.609" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">sense that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:46.789" style="s2">so I guess narrowing that point of view</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.630" end="00:37:48.950" style="s2">would be like for instance when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.789" end="00:37:51.960" style="s2">seeing red so to speak I know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.950" end="00:37:56.130" style="s2">phrase that people use aa trigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.960" end="00:37:58.080" style="s2">so when you see you get triggered you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.130" end="00:37:59.910" style="s2">get really annoyed and you only have</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.080" end="00:38:02.339" style="s2">this narrow focus that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.910" end="00:38:04.170" style="s2">example of just driving you out of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.339" end="00:38:06.119" style="s2">coherent state is that correct that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.170" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">correct I should mention by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.119" end="00:38:10.260" style="s2">astounding how often that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">under what circumstances so for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.260" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">being confused and then getting annoyed</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:19.380" style="s2">is seeing Rhett okay so a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:22.260" style="s2">misunderstanding of something could just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.380" end="00:38:24.109" style="s2">narrow your focus so to speak well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.260" end="00:38:25.859" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not quite that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.109" end="00:38:28.950" style="s2">misunderstanding of something which</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.859" end="00:38:31.170" style="s2">enters into a state of curiosity expand</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.950" end="00:38:33.570" style="s2">your focus a misunderstanding something</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.170" end="00:38:35.849" style="s2">enters into a state of annoyance or a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:38.670" style="s2">state of well either avoidance or</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.849" end="00:38:40.950" style="s2">conflict narrows your focus so avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.670" end="00:38:43.500" style="s2">in conflict being the to narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.950" end="00:38:45.830" style="s2">components right yeah going back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.500" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">something you said earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.830" end="00:38:51.089" style="s2">perception and the way people perceive</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">the world is being sort of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.089" end="00:38:57.690" style="s2">core tasks or core ways that people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:58.650" style="s2">start to engage in sovereignty I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.690" end="00:39:01.859" style="s2">have thought it would have been the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.650" end="00:39:04.849" style="s2">sense vs. meaning the stuff the second</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.859" end="00:39:08.849" style="s2">component of the sovereignty you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.849" end="00:39:11.640" style="s2">model if you will just because some</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.849" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">people struggle to make sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.640" end="00:39:17.430" style="s2">particular concept or a particular event</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:20.609" style="s2">in a certain way and therefore would</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.430" end="00:39:22.589" style="s2">training that area get you into a state</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.609" end="00:39:24.630" style="s2">of sovereignty faster or I might</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.589" end="00:39:26.520" style="s2">completely misguided there we should be</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.630" end="00:39:28.020" style="s2">in a place that actually honestly sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.520" end="00:39:30.359" style="s2">of slugging through it because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.020" end="00:39:31.830" style="s2">what this is about the short answer is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.359" end="00:39:33.930" style="s2">sometimes right and point in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.830" end="00:39:35.700" style="s2">is all going to be absolutely particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.930" end="00:39:38.490" style="s2">yeah individual there is no general</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.700" end="00:39:40.050" style="s2">answer when I start on perception the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.490" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">reason I started on perception is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.050" end="00:39:47.310" style="s2">that is the beginning of all and because</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">of the specifics of what most people</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:51.930" style="s2">have experienced developmentally most</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">people have very narrow bands in</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.930" end="00:39:55.619" style="s2">perception and in fact that&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">difficult it&#39;s not as obvious to Bill</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.619" end="00:39:58.770" style="s2">but what you&#39;re saying is also quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:01.410" style="s2">correct I actually would a different</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.770" end="00:40:03.450" style="s2">essay called on thinking and simulated</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.410" end="00:40:05.370" style="s2">thinking simulated thinking is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.450" end="00:40:07.350" style="s2">extremely common</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.370" end="00:40:09.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a comprehensive trap that removes</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.350" end="00:40:10.740" style="s2">you almost entirely from sovereignty if</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.390" end="00:40:12.600" style="s2">you enter through that door</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.740" end="00:40:14.370" style="s2">if you enter through the door okay well</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.600" end="00:40:16.680" style="s2">let&#39;s work on sense making and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.370" end="00:40:18.420" style="s2">making there is you know a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.680" end="00:40:19.710" style="s2">work and path to be engaged in there</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.420" end="00:40:21.270" style="s2">in fact so let&#39;s just take it at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.710" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">higher level this is a whole thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.270" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">a comprehensive it all the pieces fit</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.140" style="s2">together so no matter what door you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.830" end="00:40:29.580" style="s2">enter into you will quickly find that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.140" end="00:40:31.710" style="s2">the only way to move forward is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.580" end="00:40:34.050" style="s2">be found in some other portion of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.710" end="00:40:36.350" style="s2">sovereignty if it turns out that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.050" end="00:40:39.090" style="s2">have chosen to enter into the door of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.350" end="00:40:42.180" style="s2">sense making and you&#39;re working at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.090" end="00:40:43.620" style="s2">level of say bad cognitive models you</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.180" end="00:40:46.770" style="s2">might very quickly find yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.620" end="00:40:48.690" style="s2">circumstance that in order to do better</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.770" end="00:40:51.150" style="s2">you have to move into a liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.690" end="00:40:52.920" style="s2">and when you&#39;re in a liminal space the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.150" end="00:40:54.990" style="s2">way that your emotional systems are</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.920" end="00:40:57.300" style="s2">responding to it is now a very confusing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.990" end="00:40:58.890" style="s2">environment shuts down your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.300" end="00:41:00.210" style="s2">actually engage in any form of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.890" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">so now we&#39;re actually kind of moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.210" end="00:41:02.010" style="s2">into the more of the perception</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:03.630" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.010" end="00:41:06.300" style="s2">modes like right at the border how does</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.630" end="00:41:09.390" style="s2">your system recension in limb analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.300" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">a there&#39;s a significant open thing cuz</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.390" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">you&#39;re now separated from sense making</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.430" style="s2">your sense became frameworks have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:16.740" style="s2">dropped and so now you&#39;re right now in</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.430" end="00:41:18.750" style="s2">that fluid space between perception and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.740" end="00:41:20.190" style="s2">sense making and that by the way is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.750" end="00:41:22.650" style="s2">at all in common and somebody actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.190" end="00:41:24.540" style="s2">says the way that I am trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.650" end="00:41:26.520" style="s2">sense of my environment isn&#39;t working so</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.540" end="00:41:27.030" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to move into beginner&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:27.030" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">well that&#39;s very uncomfortable it often</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.010" end="00:41:34.110" style="s2">will expose a lot of stuff that was</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.110" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">we arrived we arrived at our sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.590" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">as a result of our development in the</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:46.050" style="s2">in the world is to a greater or lesser</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.800" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">degree traumatic our particular form of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.050" end="00:41:50.730" style="s2">sovereignty is a scaffolding built</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:52.530" style="s2">around that developmental landscape</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.730" end="00:41:55.050" style="s2">whatever sense making framework you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.530" end="00:41:57.720" style="s2">right now it is got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.050" end="00:41:59.880" style="s2">holes in it around traumas that were</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.720" end="00:42:02.010" style="s2">part of your growing up and when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.880" end="00:42:04.020" style="s2">drop that sense making framework a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.010" end="00:42:05.700" style="s2">of those traumas are now raw they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.020" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">longer buffeted and protected by</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.700" end="00:42:11.400" style="s2">cognitive and emotional strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:13.170" style="s2">you can use to avoid feeling bad things</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.400" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2">and so it&#39;s gonna often happens you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.170" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">gonna run into those bad things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:18.270" style="s2">you&#39;re going to feel them and so now you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.770" end="00:42:19.290" style="s2">just dropped yourself right smack back</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.270" end="00:42:21.210" style="s2">down to the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.290" end="00:42:25.380" style="s2">which is to learn how to actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.210" end="00:42:27.240" style="s2">bad things at a bit is a level without</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.380" end="00:42:29.250" style="s2">dropping out of sovereignty all together</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.240" end="00:42:30.360" style="s2">this is kind of the iteration and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.250" end="00:42:31.470" style="s2">then you&#39;ll maybe you&#39;ll get good at it</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.360" end="00:42:33.510" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll learn how to resolve a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.470" end="00:42:37.620" style="s2">trauma or just learn how to how to build</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.510" end="00:42:39.270" style="s2">more skillfulness in not avoiding trauma</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.620" end="00:42:41.160" style="s2">when it shows itself you don&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.160" end="00:42:44.130" style="s2">learned how to become responsive to but</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.050" end="00:42:45.810" style="s2">at least you&#39;ve learned how to not</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.130" end="00:42:47.640" style="s2">become reactive to them and then from</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.810" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">that basis you may begin to be begin</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.640" end="00:42:49.530" style="s2">building up a new scaffoldings of sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.530" end="00:42:54.350" style="s2">for example I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.480" end="00:42:58.140" style="s2">term artfulness and so in agency</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.350" end="00:42:59.070" style="s2">artfulness is what we&#39;re seeking and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.140" end="00:43:00.330" style="s2">reason why I&#39;m using that term is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.070" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s many people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.330" end="00:43:05.190" style="s2">connect that with sensitive and subtle</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:07.020" style="s2">perception and to have an artful</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.020" end="00:43:11.700" style="s2">right you know the difference between a</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.260" end="00:43:24.750" style="s2">things like proprioception into action</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.750" end="00:43:28.590" style="s2">my elegance in motion is first and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.750" end="00:43:31.230" style="s2">foremost tied to a very fluid connection</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.590" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">between subtle senses and all the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.230" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">through to action and so it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:36.420" style="s2">nice if you just want to watch under if</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.950" end="00:43:38.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever seen like the way that a</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.310" end="00:43:42.540" style="s2">practice just moving their hand that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.980" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">an interesting thing right because on</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.540" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">the one hand it&#39;s a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:48.680" style="s2">between perception all the different</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:52.200" style="s2">components are not jerking it you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.680" end="00:43:54.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a perception aspect and an</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.200" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">agency aspect and so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.300" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">actually build artfulness to go from</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:01.140" style="s2">skillfulness to artfulness</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:04.100" style="s2">means first and foremost to go all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.140" end="00:44:06.630" style="s2">way back down into perception and build</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.100" end="00:44:08.220" style="s2">sensitivity and and add sensitivity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.630" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">such an unconscious level that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.220" end="00:44:13.290" style="s2">actually just flow it through it flows</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">smoothly you don&#39;t have to be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.290" end="00:44:17.610" style="s2">of it you can actually now have it just</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">be a foundational element like think</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.610" end="00:44:21.210" style="s2">about like the way that you learned to</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.500" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a process of an inadequate level</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.500" end="00:44:32.849" style="s2">of sovereignty right so at the edge the</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.849" end="00:44:38.009" style="s2">complex thing building a sensitivity at</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.400" end="00:44:46.019" style="s2">meaning that it is now smoothly and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.710" end="00:44:48.479" style="s2">easily done and yet very effectively I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.019" end="00:44:49.769" style="s2">think what happens when you&#39;re a toddler</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.479" end="00:44:51.029" style="s2">what does it make it more so than we</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.089" end="00:45:01.529" style="s2">is as a capacity is maxed out by the</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.529" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">do as you become more skillful in doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.589" end="00:45:08.999" style="s2">it as you become like this the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.190" end="00:45:27.150" style="s2">become artful you&#39;re good at driving a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.079" end="00:45:30.539" style="s2">car and that Luton house becomes smooth</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.150" end="00:45:33.059" style="s2">you can run very very significant hard</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.829" end="00:45:44.940" style="s2">then okay now notice what happens that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.349" style="s2">let&#39;s try to plug this back into the</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.259" end="00:47:35.519" style="s2">actually lead to any meaningful harm</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.390" end="00:47:37.849" style="s2">it&#39;s actually rather astounding you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.519" end="00:47:40.619" style="s2">if you were to take a 16th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.849" end="00:47:44.309" style="s2">adventure and drop them smack dab in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.059" end="00:47:55.739" style="s2">just become at peace nothing because</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.119" end="00:47:57.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just too crazy and yet we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.739" end="00:47:59.999" style="s2">figured out how to pull it off so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.450" end="00:48:01.859" style="s2">actually quite hopeful that our ability</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.999" end="00:48:04.499" style="s2">to achieve individual and collective</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.859" end="00:48:06.719" style="s2">sovereignty over very complex things is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.499" end="00:48:08.190" style="s2">real we can pull it off we can do things</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.719" end="00:48:10.349" style="s2">in a way that we actually have achieved</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.190" end="00:48:12.769" style="s2">a level of artfulness in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.349" end="00:48:15.269" style="s2">them that we can render them not</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.769" end="00:48:16.859" style="s2">unreasonably hazardous well now we just</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.269" end="00:48:18.869" style="s2">have to get really really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.859" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">it and and by the way comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.869" end="00:48:22.680" style="s2">and so if you take now a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">metaphor of cars I&#39;m not just dealing</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.680" end="00:48:26.910" style="s2">with the problem of hurtling balls of</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:29.369" style="s2">steel I&#39;m also dealing with catalytic</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.369" end="00:48:34.410" style="s2">other kinds of molecules and in the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.069" end="00:48:36.150" style="s2">and 60s they were producing let well</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.410" end="00:48:37.859" style="s2"> that was a bad choice our</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.150" end="00:48:40.499" style="s2">sovereignty in this case our sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.859" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">understand the complexity of chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.499" end="00:48:44.369" style="s2">and human biology was inadequate to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.769" style="s2">reality of our capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.369" end="00:48:48.930" style="s2">shift and change on reality and we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.769" end="00:48:50.069" style="s2">created a substantial amount of harm but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.930" end="00:48:51.479" style="s2">we were able to figure it out and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.069" end="00:48:53.999" style="s2">responded to it before killing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.479" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">and so ok we move forward of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.999" end="00:48:58.410" style="s2">we&#39;re continuing to engage in that kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:49:00.210" style="s2">of a process around things like carbon</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.410" end="00:49:00.670" style="s2">dioxide and our collective sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:03.369" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.670" end="00:49:05.349" style="s2">adequate to the sense-making portion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.369" end="00:49:07.450" style="s2">that task meaning we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.349" end="00:49:09.010" style="s2">really as a Colette as a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.450" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">have enough sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.010" end="00:49:12.490" style="s2">there to actually make effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:13.780" style="s2">and our agency is also not accurate we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.490" end="00:49:15.700" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.780" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">job well but it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.700" end="00:49:18.940" style="s2">like it&#39;s so far beyond our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.140" style="s2">that it&#39;s hopeless I feel like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.940" end="00:49:21.010" style="s2">actually made great strides and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.140" end="00:49:23.319" style="s2">interesting to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.010" end="00:49:25.000" style="s2">particular problem you know Alan musk as</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.319" end="00:49:26.500" style="s2">a particular individual trickled look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.000" end="00:49:28.420" style="s2">it and said you know I think I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.500" end="00:49:29.829" style="s2">way to solve this problem I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.420" end="00:49:31.000" style="s2">cut through the Gordian knot I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.829" end="00:49:32.799" style="s2">gonna go ahead and move us all the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.000" end="00:49:33.970" style="s2">to electric cars and I know how to pull</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.799" end="00:49:35.020" style="s2">that off without having a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.970" end="00:49:36.280" style="s2">cord nature it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.020" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">interesting how that happens we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.280" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">actually do a whole whole little story</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">on the relationship between collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:42.490" style="s2">and individual capacity in the broader</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">scheme of things which is nice like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.490" end="00:49:45.849" style="s2">kind of thing can happen and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:48.520" style="s2">helpful it grabs hold chunks of problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.849" end="00:49:50.020" style="s2">and moves them in a different sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.520" end="00:49:51.700" style="s2">making or collective sovereignty domain</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.020" end="00:49:56.109" style="s2">but again if we zoom back the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.700" end="00:49:58.630" style="s2">problematic exponential innovation</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.109" end="00:50:02.589" style="s2">exponential technology growth in the sub</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.589" end="00:50:07.500" style="s2">fact that innovation is hard to do but</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.420" end="00:50:09.460" style="s2">easy to copy means that if our pace of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.500" end="00:50:12.819" style="s2">collective individual collective</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.460" end="00:50:15.910" style="s2">sovereignty doesn&#39;t keep up with our</p>

<p begin="00:50:15.910" end="00:50:18.970" style="s2">on the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.599" end="00:50:20.380" style="s2">then we&#39;re when we will in fact if for</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.970" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">sure kill ourselves it&#39;s actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.380" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">it&#39;s guaranteed there&#39;s there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.410" style="s2">no way that can&#39;t be disastrous and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:30.369" style="s2">not like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want that to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.410" end="00:50:33.430" style="s2">sound pre-emptive or visceral it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.369" end="00:50:35.829" style="s2">literally just math it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.430" end="00:50:38.799" style="s2">if tomorrow I have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.829" end="00:50:41.740" style="s2">generate two levels of harm and I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.799" end="00:50:43.540" style="s2">the ability to manage that at the level</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.740" end="00:50:44.980" style="s2">of two and the next I could do four</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.540" end="00:50:47.049" style="s2">levels of harm but I can manage it at</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.980" end="00:50:48.280" style="s2">the level of three and then the next day</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.049" end="00:50:49.480" style="s2">it&#39;s eight levels harm I can mention</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">level of four all right so I&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.480" end="00:50:53.559" style="s2">exponential growth of harm and a linear</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:56.619" style="s2">growth of management and let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.559" end="00:50:58.950" style="s2">world can survive a level of say 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.619" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">harm I can actually go for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.950" end="00:51:03.990" style="s2">not notice you know the world is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:05.770" style="s2">okay you&#39;re doing 500 harm but who cares</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.990" end="00:51:07.720" style="s2">10,500 doesn&#39;t you know I can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.770" end="00:51:09.609" style="s2">cash it out but at an exponential rate</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.720" end="00:51:12.130" style="s2">when I&#39;m somewhere in the range of you</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.609" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">know a thousand harm I&#39;m only a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.130" end="00:51:14.589" style="s2">seconds away from killing and just to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:15.969" style="s2">bring everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.589" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the keeper that&#39;s the insight is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.969" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s an acceleration issue it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:22.329" style="s2">a velocity issue is an acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:25.630" style="s2">issue and think they&#39;re accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.329" end="00:51:28.930" style="s2">your ability to respond to what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.630" end="00:51:30.759" style="s2">consequences of your actions are is much</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.930" end="00:51:33.549" style="s2">less than you think you&#39;re projecting</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.759" end="00:51:35.109" style="s2">forward and saying okay I&#39;m going out a</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.549" end="00:51:36.369" style="s2">hundred miles an hour so that thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.109" end="00:51:38.289" style="s2">that&#39;s ahead of me is gonna come at me</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.369" end="00:51:40.150" style="s2">at a certain rate but you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.289" end="00:51:42.279" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually going to be</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.279" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">hour 130 miles an hour and so things are</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.950" end="00:51:48.579" style="s2">coming fast this happens by the way for</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:49.809" style="s2">people who jump out of airplanes there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.839" end="00:52:03.130" style="s2">we get extremely surprised by how</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.930" end="00:52:29.799" style="s2">things had changed rapidly enough that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.119" end="00:52:31.329" style="s2">we&#39;re even conscious the fact that those</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.799" end="00:52:32.499" style="s2">changes were meaningful but now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.329" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">returning to a time frame where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.499" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">in fact changing so rapidly the decades</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:38.650" style="s2">are see changes alright so then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:40.930" style="s2">what I said this is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.650" end="00:52:43.539" style="s2">mathematics that we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.930" end="00:52:46.539" style="s2">come to the point where the technologies</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.539" end="00:52:50.499" style="s2">of sovereignty become the primary object</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.539" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">of our innovation frontier so the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.499" end="00:52:56.469" style="s2">and foremost before we increase any</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:58.420" style="s2">other capacity we have already increased</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.469" end="00:53:00.489" style="s2">our capacity for individual and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.420" end="00:53:03.489" style="s2">collective sovereignty so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.489" end="00:53:05.979" style="s2">always certain that our capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.489" end="00:53:08.890" style="s2">responsive to our compart our abilities</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.979" end="00:53:11.289" style="s2">is always equal to our abilities did</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.890" end="00:53:14.019" style="s2">that make sense it does but it evokes a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.289" end="00:53:16.299" style="s2">lot of questions because if I look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.019" end="00:53:18.339" style="s2">and maybe I&#39;m seeing the wrong side of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.299" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">the story here but if I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.339" end="00:53:23.910" style="s2">world right now and I see that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:26.559" style="s2">developing all these technologies AI</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.910" end="00:53:27.940" style="s2">CRISPR I guess nuclear energy to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.559" end="00:53:31.210" style="s2">certain extent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.940" end="00:53:33.190" style="s2">sovereignty I guess the the focus on</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.210" end="00:53:35.770" style="s2">sovereignty as a development and one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.190" end="00:53:39.819" style="s2">those technology seems to be behind</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.770" end="00:53:42.250" style="s2">those technologies so I guess question</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.819" end="00:53:44.589" style="s2">that I have is how do we catch up and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.250" end="00:53:47.740" style="s2">that part b of that question is really</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.589" end="00:53:50.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked a lot about individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.740" end="00:53:52.450" style="s2">sovereignty how do we go to collective</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.020" end="00:53:55.510" style="s2">sovereignty all right so let&#39;s put a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.450" end="00:53:57.609" style="s2">note right here because what&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.510" end="00:53:58.809" style="s2">happen is gonna be really good i want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.609" end="00:53:59.650" style="s2">get to the good stuff first but i want</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.809" end="00:54:00.910" style="s2">to lay a little bit of groundwork</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.650" end="00:54:03.480" style="s2">alright so let&#39;s start with a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.910" end="00:54:06.280" style="s2">interesting problematic and that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.480" end="00:54:09.069" style="s2">unfortunately the strategies associated</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.280" end="00:54:10.660" style="s2">with rival risk game theory conflict</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.069" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">competition that is in the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.660" end="00:54:16.089" style="s2">conflict as for a long time understood</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:17.950" style="s2">that sense making itself is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.089" end="00:54:21.039" style="s2">thing that often you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.950" end="00:54:22.990" style="s2">break but in the after the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.039" end="00:54:24.670" style="s2">started you know after we realized we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.990" end="00:54:27.329" style="s2">couldn&#39;t just beat the other guy up with</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.670" end="00:54:29.680" style="s2">bigger bombs we entered into a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.329" end="00:54:31.510" style="s2">acceleration of what I call the war on</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.680" end="00:54:33.970" style="s2">sense-making this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.510" end="00:54:36.339" style="s2">excruciatingly ly problematic because if</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.970" end="00:54:38.049" style="s2">we&#39;ve identified building capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.339" end="00:54:40.809" style="s2">the technologies of sovereignty is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.049" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">most needful thing being an environment</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.809" end="00:54:45.460" style="s2">with winning the war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:48.819" style="s2">is in fact one of the primary areas of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.460" end="00:54:50.589" style="s2">rival risk competition is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.819" end="00:54:52.839" style="s2">bad does that make sense why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.589" end="00:54:55.089" style="s2">case no do you mind just unpacking that</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.839" end="00:54:57.549" style="s2">a little bit so sure so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.089" end="00:54:59.619" style="s2">difficult let&#39;s just use this as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.549" end="00:55:01.480" style="s2">example I said what we&#39;re endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.619" end="00:55:05.319" style="s2">do you and I we are endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.480" end="00:55:07.990" style="s2">engage in the formation of a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.319" end="00:55:09.099" style="s2">between us we are collaborating which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.990" end="00:55:10.869" style="s2">to say that we&#39;re endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.099" end="00:55:12.700" style="s2">construct a collaborative sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.869" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">and to jump to the end the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.700" end="00:55:15.549" style="s2">figured this out as we build</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:17.230" style="s2">collaborative sovereignty no particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.549" end="00:55:19.299" style="s2">individuals opportunity anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.230" end="00:55:20.710" style="s2">enough if I thought you were lying to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.299" end="00:55:23.049" style="s2">if I thought you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.710" end="00:55:24.520" style="s2">manipulate me or take advantage of me or</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.049" end="00:55:25.869" style="s2">even if I just entered into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.520" end="00:55:28.029" style="s2">where I couldn&#39;t trust you enough to</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.869" end="00:55:29.650" style="s2">tell you the full and honest truth that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.029" end="00:55:31.150" style="s2">is catastrophic for collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.650" end="00:55:32.859" style="s2">sovereignty it&#39;s not a little bit bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.150" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s actually catastrophic or you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.859" end="00:55:38.109" style="s2">even begin to enter into collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:40.230" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a frame when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.109" end="00:55:41.290" style="s2">nervous when you&#39;re in a space of</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.290" end="00:55:45.430" style="s2">defection okay well that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.660" end="00:55:48.610" style="s2">exploited describes our entire global</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.430" end="00:55:51.790" style="s2">environment I I can&#39;t trust anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.610" end="00:55:55.480" style="s2">that is currently conveyed through any</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.790" end="00:55:58.450" style="s2">kind of signaling mechanism if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.480" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not human to human right in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.450" end="00:56:04.540" style="s2">conversation with you I can enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:06.130" style="s2">space of potential collaboration and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.540" end="00:56:07.330" style="s2">happen to have made a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.130" end="00:56:09.220" style="s2">being willing to take the risk of doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.330" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">so so I will always enter and tell you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.220" end="00:56:13.900" style="s2">volunteer making myself fully vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:15.340" style="s2">to you defecting to me and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.900" end="00:56:17.500" style="s2">know if it turns out you do I just sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.340" end="00:56:18.790" style="s2">of shut down and stop engaging with you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.500" end="00:56:20.620" style="s2">and kind of cleave you from the graph</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.790" end="00:56:21.940" style="s2">like you&#39;re now hostile no more</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.620" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">engagement it&#39;s actually literally</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.940" end="00:56:25.870" style="s2">called double tit-for-tat in game theory</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:27.700" style="s2">but the technology&#39;s just broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.870" end="00:56:29.020" style="s2">don&#39;t work that way so I can&#39;t trust any</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.700" end="00:56:30.760" style="s2">signal that comes from broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.020" end="00:56:32.110" style="s2">full-stop doesn&#39;t matter I don&#39;t care if</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.760" end="00:56:35.310" style="s2">I think they&#39;re well-intentioned or not</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.110" end="00:56:38.170" style="s2">the underlying incentive structures and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.310" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">organizational dynamics that control the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.170" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">broadcast signals guarantee that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.590" style="s2">are so deeply embedded in the war on</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:46.150" style="s2">sense-making that they cannot be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.590" end="00:56:47.740" style="s2">which means that they cannot be used for</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.150" end="00:56:49.390" style="s2">collaboration which means that any</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.740" end="00:56:52.450" style="s2">signal that comes from them or drives</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.390" end="00:56:53.830" style="s2">them is effectively a virus that breaks</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.450" end="00:56:55.330" style="s2">down our capacity to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.830" end="00:56:56.500" style="s2">individual and collaborative sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.330" end="00:56:58.330" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a big deal what I just</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.500" end="00:57:00.910" style="s2">said just declared it was the media</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.330" end="00:57:03.610" style="s2">basically yeah no question it is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.910" end="00:57:05.980" style="s2">comprehensive existential conflict that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.610" end="00:57:07.510" style="s2">must be won and here&#39;s the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.980" end="00:57:09.700" style="s2">know the phrase like it&#39;s a phrase like</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.510" end="00:57:11.110" style="s2">if you go to war with monsters be</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.700" end="00:57:13.300" style="s2">wearing less you become a monster</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.110" end="00:57:15.010" style="s2">yourself those lines this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.300" end="00:57:16.570" style="s2">where we have to have enough individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.010" end="00:57:19.180" style="s2">sovereignty that we can actually go</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.570" end="00:57:20.920" style="s2">enter into this war without becoming</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:23.310" style="s2">monsters ourselves and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.920" end="00:57:25.600" style="s2">actually have enough capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.310" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">recognize what it is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.600" end="00:57:30.010" style="s2">boundary without entering into struggle</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:31.810" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.010" end="00:57:32.590" style="s2">Aikido but Aikido is a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.810" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">what that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.590" end="00:57:38.230" style="s2">not Aikido but I&#39;d done my Thai that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.430" style="s2">very different different actually yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.230" end="00:57:41.350" style="s2">you can actually if you if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.430" end="00:57:42.520" style="s2">sort of imagine well what I would</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.350" end="00:57:43.960" style="s2">suggest is just doing a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.520" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">Aikido and then comparing the two and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.960" end="00:57:48.970" style="s2">that actually gives you a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:50.890" style="s2">the sense the odd Lina the Jedi in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.970" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">early Star Wars movies actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.890" end="00:57:55.260" style="s2">sense of this and to be able to to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:58.270" style="s2">connect with what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.260" end="00:58:00.700" style="s2">extremely capable of actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.270" end="00:58:03.970" style="s2">in combat without actually but at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.700" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">level of your heart or soul being in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.970" end="00:58:08.410" style="s2">fight is the thing okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:10.810" style="s2">a bit of far-field but it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.410" end="00:58:12.070" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing this is actually</p>

<p begin="01:00:56.910" end="01:01:01.320" style="s2">we have to innovate a level of</p>

<p begin="01:01:01.320" end="01:01:04.610" style="s2">is something that we&#39;ve never even begun</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.610" end="01:01:09.240" style="s2">finally on the omnipresent and always</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.110" end="01:01:12.270" style="s2">ironic third hand we&#39;re doing so in the</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.270" end="01:01:16.860" style="s2">that that is profound and accelerating</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.860" end="01:01:19.560" style="s2">the situation so what did I say there</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.390" end="01:01:20.610" style="s2">was good news well it turns out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.560" end="01:01:22.940" style="s2">actually really good news it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.610" end="01:01:26.040" style="s2">interesting actually the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.940" end="01:01:29.160" style="s2">exponential as it turns out the essence</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.040" end="01:01:31.110" style="s2">of exponential is collaboration okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.160" end="01:01:32.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not obvious unfortunately be nice</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.110" end="01:01:33.240" style="s2">if it was obvious they see if I can find</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.250" end="01:01:35.340" style="s2">a way to make that a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.240" end="01:01:37.290" style="s2">clear going back to the innovation on</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.340" end="01:01:39.270" style="s2">top or copying on top of innovation</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.290" end="01:01:41.070" style="s2">leading to further innovation is that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.270" end="01:01:42.180" style="s2">yeah let me do it this way actually this</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.070" end="01:01:44.520" style="s2">is actually puppet Buddha way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.180" end="01:01:46.740" style="s2">it in in World War two the Manhattan</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.450" end="01:05:28.610" style="s2">you&#39;re racing in a conflict of how to go</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.390" style="s2">just sort of elegantly slow down alright</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.890" end="01:07:25.640" style="s2">that was a gigantic payload and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.390" end="01:07:27.260" style="s2">some pretty poorly rock concepts that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.640" end="01:07:29.420" style="s2">threw down so I imagined that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.260" end="01:07:31.550" style="s2">actually deliver much but hopefully it</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.420" end="01:07:32.990" style="s2">was at least a gesture in the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.550" end="01:07:35.570" style="s2">direction I think it was very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.990" end="01:07:37.460" style="s2">now one question that came out of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.570" end="01:07:39.230" style="s2">is that you said things like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.460" end="01:07:42.710" style="s2">Manhattan Project in the past were a</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.230" end="01:07:45.050" style="s2">recognition on the part of conflict or</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.710" end="01:07:48.080" style="s2">the conflicting side that they needed to</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.050" end="01:07:51.170" style="s2">innovate right yep how do you see</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.080" end="01:07:53.930" style="s2">sovereignty expanding if the government</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.170" end="01:07:55.580" style="s2">in this well these are in conflict in</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.930" end="01:07:58.369" style="s2">the past has been government how do you</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.580" end="01:08:00.920" style="s2">see sovereignty expanding if governments</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.369" end="01:08:02.840" style="s2">are not aligned or if governments aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.920" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">cooperating in general with this concept</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.840" end="01:08:07.040" style="s2">of individual sovereignty we are going</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.119" end="01:08:08.690" style="s2">to have to reinvent governance which</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.040" end="01:08:11.060" style="s2">almost certainly will imply routing</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.690" end="01:08:12.500" style="s2">around government and I it&#39;s funny like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.060" end="01:08:14.660" style="s2">yeah I said that was a very much</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.500" end="01:08:16.310" style="s2">straight face and it&#39;s because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.660" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">oddly enough in the scope of things</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.310" end="01:08:19.130" style="s2">actually not that much of a big deal</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:20.450" style="s2">we&#39;re already in the process of doing it</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.130" end="01:08:22.220" style="s2">I mean just think about like just being</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.450" end="01:08:24.140" style="s2">a cryptocurrency one minute before</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.220" end="01:08:26.930" style="s2">cryptocurrency happened it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.140" end="01:08:29.930" style="s2">absolutely impossible for anybody to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.930" end="01:08:32.330" style="s2">create a currency that wasn&#39;t a state</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.930" end="01:08:34.220" style="s2">actor like literally the nanosecond</p>

<p begin="01:08:34.220" end="01:08:39.230" style="s2">it was categorically impossible and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.310" end="01:08:40.700" style="s2">know we now sit in the era where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.230" end="01:08:42.130" style="s2">obviously trivial there&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.130" end="01:08:46.759" style="s2">so that&#39;s it&#39;s happening and it turned</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.630" end="01:08:48.859" style="s2">out it&#39;s actually in the space of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.759" end="01:08:50.450" style="s2">creative genius and it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.859" end="01:08:52.220" style="s2">way of putting it and particularly</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.450" end="01:08:55.310" style="s2">collaborative creative genius which is</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.470" end="01:09:02.839" style="s2">of that is so enormous that these</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.589" end="01:09:04.819" style="s2">problems end up being prosaic so</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.839" end="01:09:06.529" style="s2">government as big as it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.819" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s powerful listen don&#39;t get me</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.529" end="01:09:09.710" style="s2">wrong is actually miniscule in</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.989" end="01:09:21.589" style="s2">something interesting going on right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.130" end="01:09:22.609" style="s2">in the world of watching broadly</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.589" end="01:09:24.349" style="s2">speaking it&#39;s actually the whole point</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.609" end="01:09:26.449" style="s2">is that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not that so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.349" end="01:09:28.429" style="s2">might become very interested in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.449" end="01:09:29.449" style="s2">project called holo chain in fact I got</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.429" end="01:09:31.639" style="s2">to tell you right now that even though I</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.210" end="01:09:39.199" style="s2">of attention at it and the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:41.179" style="s2">I&#39;m positioning it is interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.199" end="01:09:43.310" style="s2">that it&#39;s part of an arc so if you look</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.179" end="01:09:45.230" style="s2">at at the arc it&#39;s basically been</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.299" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about those two</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:01.840" style="s2">the direction of more capacity to engage</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.060" end="01:10:06.139" style="s2">in collaboration and hollow chain is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:08.060" style="s2">really quite vastly more of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.139" end="01:10:10.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a phrase that the I like which</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.060" end="01:10:11.989" style="s2">is called culture eats strategy for</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.590" end="01:10:22.520" style="s2">but one of the biggest challenges</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.949" end="01:10:29.000" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna call it culture meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.869" end="01:10:31.579" style="s2">all too often they&#39;ve come into</p>

<p begin="01:10:31.579" end="01:10:34.639" style="s2">looks an awful lot like 12 year old kids</p>

<p begin="01:10:34.639" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">particularly effective way to resolve</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.869" end="01:10:38.510" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s definitely not a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:39.889" style="s2">particularly attractive way to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.510" end="01:10:41.599" style="s2">collaboration because it generates hurt</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.889" end="01:10:43.070" style="s2">feelings it generates people who feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.599" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">like the other people are not to be</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.070" end="01:10:51.710" style="s2">have now sorted into different groups</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.329" end="01:10:53.329" style="s2">that are now in competition with each</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.710" end="01:10:55.250" style="s2">other engaging in all kinds of weird</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.329" end="01:10:57.079" style="s2">stupid but also even the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.250" end="01:10:58.550" style="s2">individuals in subgroups are now left to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.079" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">serve and sense of like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.550" end="01:11:00.860" style="s2">maybe this is not a safe place to be and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:02.060" style="s2">I need to be less trusting other people</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.860" end="01:11:04.070" style="s2">around me so you&#39;ve got like a</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.070" end="01:11:09.099" style="s2">actually seems to have spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.079" end="01:11:11.389" style="s2">work on just building sovereignty as</p>

<p begin="01:11:20.040" end="01:11:24.840" style="s2">has consciousness of questions like</p>

<p begin="01:11:24.840" end="01:11:27.659" style="s2">like how do we enter into spaces of</p>

<p begin="01:11:27.659" end="01:11:31.260" style="s2">good at that and on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.610" end="01:11:32.639" style="s2">they&#39;ve actually constructed something</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.260" end="01:11:33.989" style="s2">which when you double-click on it and</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.639" end="01:11:35.969" style="s2">take a look at the code and the</p>

<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:48.270" style="s2">fact that we are ambiently discovering</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.810" end="01:11:50.070" style="s2">that the niche of selective advantage in</p>

<p begin="01:11:53.070" end="01:11:56.130" style="s2">right how the chain is going to</p>

<p begin="01:11:58.500" end="01:12:03.690" style="s2">tests okay so that the niche of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.860" end="01:12:05.310" style="s2">collective competitive advantages in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.690" end="01:12:07.560" style="s2">space of individual and collaborative</p>

<p begin="01:12:19.170" end="01:12:24.090" style="s2">right now an actual but a potential of</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.820" end="01:12:26.280" style="s2">say a thousand times more creative or</p>

<p begin="01:12:29.670" end="01:12:31.889" style="s2">I&#39;d say right now we can say that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.659" end="01:12:33.389" style="s2">theorem is about a hundred times more</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.889" end="01:12:34.409" style="s2">creative than Bitcoin if you look at all</p>

<p begin="01:12:36.570" end="01:12:40.020" style="s2">interesting I would say right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.099" end="01:12:41.790" style="s2">making a bold claim but I could be very</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.020" end="01:12:43.349" style="s2">well wrong and I haven&#39;t done enough</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.790" end="01:12:46.139" style="s2">work to be able to feel super-confident</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.349" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">but my spidey sense is is is telling me</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.139" end="01:12:48.420" style="s2">that and it&#39;s a really good example of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:50.730" style="s2">the nature of what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.420" end="01:12:54.270" style="s2">Jordan I want to transition a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.730" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">because one of the the project that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.270" end="01:12:57.719" style="s2">you&#39;re involved in and how I came to</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.440" end="01:13:00.270" style="s2">know you neuro hacker collective in</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.719" end="01:13:03.000" style="s2">terms of attacking this whole question</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.270" end="01:13:05.190" style="s2">of sovereignty and how to develop</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.000" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">sovereignty both on the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.190" end="01:13:09.869" style="s2">on a collective level how do you guys do</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:11.940" style="s2">that in terms of the products do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.869" end="01:13:15.119" style="s2">that you produce do you mind just going</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.940" end="01:13:17.130" style="s2">a little bit on well you have quality</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.119" end="01:13:20.070" style="s2">and quality of mind out right now yep</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.130" end="01:13:20.760" style="s2">how those help individuals develop</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.760" end="01:13:24.420" style="s2">okay so first and this is actually I</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.920" end="01:13:26.520" style="s2">think important this is mostly a</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.420" end="01:13:29.400" style="s2">question for Daniel neuro hackers is</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.520" end="01:13:31.530" style="s2">vastly more centred on his area of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.400" end="01:13:32.250" style="s2">expertise than mine I am a collaborator</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.530" end="01:13:33.780" style="s2">he is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.250" end="01:13:35.070" style="s2">core collaborator he&#39;s the Turing in</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.780" end="01:13:37.290" style="s2">this story and I&#39;m the guy who kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.070" end="01:13:39.270" style="s2">bias Springs during his lunch it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.290" end="01:13:41.130" style="s2">pretty fair comparison so this lets me</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.270" end="01:13:43.320" style="s2">look at from the point of view first why</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.130" end="01:13:45.660" style="s2">why this particular thing and approach</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.320" end="01:13:47.190" style="s2">and then how and I can I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.660" end="01:13:49.020" style="s2">simulate the how pretty well so for</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.190" end="01:13:49.920" style="s2">purposes of like pretend look looking</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.020" end="01:13:51.630" style="s2">like I know what I&#39;m talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.920" end="01:13:53.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll do an okay job but its core to</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.630" end="01:13:55.200" style="s2">recognize that I&#39;m mostly simulating it</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.040" end="01:13:57.030" style="s2">why well we&#39;ve already identified why</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.200" end="01:13:59.310" style="s2">the technologies of sovereignty are the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.030" end="01:14:01.430" style="s2">thing the thing that actually is is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.310" end="01:14:04.140" style="s2">most needful in the moment why this</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.430" end="01:14:07.770" style="s2">particular thing we&#39;ve got two things</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.140" end="01:14:09.690" style="s2">going on one is the problem of what I</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.770" end="01:14:11.850" style="s2">call in media stressed we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.690" end="01:14:14.310" style="s2">world we&#39;re in a world that is happening</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.850" end="01:14:15.750" style="s2">in in in ways and we are in that world</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.310" end="01:14:17.850" style="s2">and we have certain capabilities of</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.750" end="01:14:19.350" style="s2">being present in the world I can&#39;t snap</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.850" end="01:14:22.200" style="s2">my fingers and make things happen I have</p>

<p begin="01:14:22.200" end="01:14:27.210" style="s2">to be my personal capabilities are so in</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.690" end="01:14:31.020" style="s2">looking at the space of possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.210" end="01:14:33.480" style="s2">what could be done by us for real right</p>

<p begin="01:14:33.480" end="01:14:38.400" style="s2">in the context of what actually must be</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.700" end="01:14:40.590" style="s2">done in what order we ended up</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.590" end="01:14:45.630" style="s2">particular event was a good use of time</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.630" end="01:14:51.090" style="s2">like this on the one hand the physical</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.270" end="01:14:52.650" style="s2">body is the primary instrument of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.090" end="01:14:54.780" style="s2">sovereignty let&#39;s put it very simply</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.650" end="01:14:57.480" style="s2">with very limited exceptions if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:15:01.230" end="01:15:05.850" style="s2">habits and if you&#39;re physically ill we</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:07.230" style="s2">can&#39;t be sovereign alright and this</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.850" end="01:15:08.610" style="s2">actually by the way shows up not just in</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.710" end="01:20:52.500" style="s2">into the field of empowered</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.700" end="01:20:54.780" style="s2">responsibility it does not mean that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.500" end="01:20:57.480" style="s2">are in fact actually sovereign it means</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.780" end="01:20:59.880" style="s2">that you have chosen to begin taking</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.480" end="01:21:00.840" style="s2">that path and that choice is the first</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.880" end="01:21:02.550" style="s2">choice like if you haven&#39;t made the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.840" end="01:21:04.410" style="s2">choice it&#39;s very difficult to go any</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.550" end="01:21:06.660" style="s2">further but once you&#39;ve made the choice</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.410" end="01:21:08.640" style="s2">then two good things happen one is you</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.660" end="01:21:10.590" style="s2">become more available to yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.640" end="01:21:12.390" style="s2">two is you become more capable of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.590" end="01:21:14.490" style="s2">entering into collaboration I can</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.390" end="01:21:15.750" style="s2">collaborate with you and or anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.490" end="01:21:18.510" style="s2">who&#39;s chosen to enter into that space</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.750" end="01:21:20.280" style="s2">because I can say something that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.510" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound right but instead of going</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.280" end="01:21:26.250" style="s2">from confusion into avoidance you may be</p>

<p begin="01:21:26.250" end="01:21:31.680" style="s2">curiosity is a more powerful response</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.950" end="01:21:32.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of it once we can do</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.680" end="01:21:34.770" style="s2">that now we&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.580" end="01:21:36.540" style="s2">collaboratively build it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.770" end="01:21:38.160" style="s2">collaborative unfortunate this is not an</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.160" end="01:21:41.160" style="s2">unfortunately it simply is not an L on</p>

<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:49.670" style="s2">wonderful but we can begin the process</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.800" end="01:21:52.230" style="s2">of figuring out how we go about</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.670" end="01:21:55.050" style="s2">collaboratively constructing these</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.230" end="01:21:56.520" style="s2">spaces of creative coherence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.050" end="01:21:58.940" style="s2">it like that&#39;s that&#39;s ends up being the</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.520" end="01:22:01.980" style="s2">whole game so this is not a trivial</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.940" end="01:22:04.890" style="s2">effort right we are not in this for the</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.660" end="01:22:30.710" style="s2">can personally attest to just quality as</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.180" end="01:22:33.050" style="s2">effectiveness I&#39;ve taken it for about</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.710" end="01:22:34.070" style="s2">ten months now and just like you said</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.050" end="01:22:35.840" style="s2">being able to engage in that</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.070" end="01:22:38.090" style="s2">conversation and really reduce those</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.840" end="01:22:40.580" style="s2">anxieties so that you can be more</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.090" end="01:22:42.710" style="s2">open-minded and admit when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.580" end="01:22:45.320" style="s2">understand something and see curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.710" end="01:22:48.710" style="s2">has been frankly life-changing for me so</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.320" end="01:22:50.630" style="s2">thank you very much for that one I guess</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.710" end="01:22:52.340" style="s2">a couple more questions because I know</p>

<p begin="01:24:38.900" end="01:24:44.090" style="s2">so there was a path of climbing a hill</p>

<p begin="01:25:03.920" end="01:25:07.850" style="s2">luck and so they ended up more or less</p>

<p begin="01:25:52.700" end="01:25:56.300" style="s2">I would like come across something it</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.740" end="01:25:57.770" style="s2">would just be a human that&#39;s attractive</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.300" end="01:26:00.770" style="s2">like like a five year old a six or seven</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.770" end="01:26:03.200" style="s2">year old an eight year old and I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.770" end="01:26:05.360" style="s2">get reasonably obsessed about them and</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.200" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">since I spent a substantial amount of my</p>

<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:12.680" style="s2">them and so this would be for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.870" end="01:26:14.690" style="s2">computers I was very deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.680" end="01:26:16.040" style="s2">computers about as early as you could</p>

<p begin="01:26:16.040" end="01:26:21.380" style="s2">historically like born in 1971 and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.640" end="01:26:22.700" style="s2">know playing with computers more less as</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.380" end="01:26:25.610" style="s2">soon as personal computers became</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.700" end="01:26:27.440" style="s2">available at all and then a lot I could</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.610" end="01:26:28.640" style="s2">actually my wife asked me a question</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.440" end="01:26:31.610" style="s2">like if you&#39;ve been born now what would</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.640" end="01:26:33.440" style="s2">you do and the short answer is well that</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.610" end="01:26:35.810" style="s2">kid would have never gotten off the</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.440" end="01:26:36.950" style="s2">internet which is not healthy but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.810" end="01:26:38.690" style="s2">probably what would have happened the</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.950" end="01:26:39.800" style="s2">only reason I got off the internet back</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.690" end="01:26:41.450" style="s2">when I had a modem was because my</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.800" end="01:26:43.070" style="s2">parents needed to use the phone if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.450" end="01:26:44.270" style="s2">would call how those work I mean all the</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.070" end="01:26:46.220" style="s2">other stuff that interesting enough we</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.270" end="01:26:47.780" style="s2">can actually broadly call nerd nerd</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.220" end="01:26:48.920" style="s2">culture for example things like science</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.780" end="01:26:52.010" style="s2">fiction and comic books were</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.920" end="01:26:52.760" style="s2">role-playing games and science itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.010" end="01:26:54.530" style="s2">mathematic</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.760" end="01:26:56.660" style="s2">these were all and here&#39;s the thing I</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.530" end="01:26:59.090" style="s2">had this really interesting recognition</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.660" end="01:27:02.390" style="s2">that each one of these is kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.090" end="01:27:05.000" style="s2">bat signal or a lighthouse of beacon by</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.390" end="01:27:07.250" style="s2">a kind of mind or a kind of spirit that</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.000" end="01:27:09.560" style="s2">was endeavoring to signal out the space</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.250" end="01:27:12.080" style="s2">of creative coherence in spite of being</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.560" end="01:27:15.470" style="s2">in a world that was hostile to that is</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.080" end="01:27:18.020" style="s2">endeavoring to speak in collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.470" end="01:27:20.060" style="s2">with anyone who was willing to actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.020" end="01:27:22.400" style="s2">listen and some of these cases they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.060" end="01:27:25.400" style="s2">actually cryptographic a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:27.170" style="s2">cases actually meaning many many</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.400" end="01:27:30.800" style="s2">geniuses in the past figured out how to</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.170" end="01:27:32.570" style="s2">say something that was attractive in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.800" end="01:27:35.690" style="s2">prosaic language of the world in which</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.570" end="01:27:37.730" style="s2">they lived but actually carried a more</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.690" end="01:27:39.910" style="s2">fundamental payloads that those who were</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.730" end="01:27:41.750" style="s2">able to hear it in fact I&#39;d say that was</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.910" end="01:27:44.360" style="s2">somebody figured that out a long time</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.750" end="01:27:46.370" style="s2">ago and it&#39;s my comment and for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.360" end="01:27:48.490" style="s2">reason I found that I was attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.370" end="01:27:52.400" style="s2">those kinds of things and repulsed by</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.490" end="01:27:55.130" style="s2">things that felt bad like you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.400" end="01:27:58.060" style="s2">watching TV shows or movies or reading</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.130" end="01:28:00.710" style="s2">books that had a certain I know you say</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.060" end="01:28:04.930" style="s2">exploitative nature to them that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.710" end="01:28:08.090" style="s2">would they used your own humaneness to</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.930" end="01:28:10.880" style="s2">take advantage of you a good marketing</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.090" end="01:28:14.210" style="s2">it is it basically and so that just ends</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.880" end="01:28:16.730" style="s2">up becoming it builds on itself you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.210" end="01:28:18.560" style="s2">if you when you&#39;re like ten four</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.730" end="01:28:21.770" style="s2">different find yourself reading</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.560" end="01:28:23.240" style="s2">Nietzsche and trying to actually do the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.770" end="01:28:26.420" style="s2">thing that Nietzsche says which is not</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.240" end="01:28:27.890" style="s2">become a follower and it&#39;s his his his</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.420" end="01:28:30.650" style="s2">hope the whole point of Nietzsche&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.890" end="01:28:32.690" style="s2">to actually listen and then stop</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.650" end="01:28:33.710" style="s2">following that&#39;s a good okay what does</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.690" end="01:28:35.810" style="s2">that mean when you&#39;re ten years old and</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.710" end="01:28:38.510" style="s2">then you know turn the corner and say</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.810" end="01:28:41.300" style="s2">reading Asimov and saying okay now I can</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.510" end="01:28:44.750" style="s2">imagine these vast possibilities what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.300" end="01:28:46.250" style="s2">available in universe and then going and</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.750" end="01:28:48.080" style="s2">say playing a role-playing game where</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.250" end="01:28:49.670" style="s2">you begin to recognize that identity the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.080" end="01:28:52.880" style="s2">identity that you&#39;re handed as a human</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.670" end="01:28:54.500" style="s2">being in the world is no more real than</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.880" end="01:28:56.450" style="s2">the identity that you just adopted in</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.500" end="01:29:00.260" style="s2">your role-playing game you know I I am</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.450" end="01:29:03.380" style="s2">as much Jordan Hall as I am Hagar the</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.260" end="01:29:04.910" style="s2">dwarf and it&#39;s just okay well how much</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.380" end="01:29:06.899" style="s2">time do I spend there and how do other</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.910" end="01:29:09.419" style="s2">people relate to me it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.899" end="01:29:10.769" style="s2">exactly the same but it&#39;s if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.419" end="01:29:12.149" style="s2">lot of similarity and it creates a</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.769" end="01:29:14.519" style="s2">consciousness space it creates the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.149" end="01:29:17.309" style="s2">fluidity of being able to not be</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.519" end="01:29:20.099" style="s2">addicted to a particular paradigm to a</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.309" end="01:29:22.079" style="s2">particular identity or being addicted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.099" end="01:29:23.510" style="s2">not being addicted to them right to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.079" end="01:29:25.739" style="s2">sort of quitting about but actually a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.510" end="01:29:27.629" style="s2">fluidity in liminal space that allows</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.739" end="01:29:30.689" style="s2">you to be receptive to the possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.629" end="01:29:33.599" style="s2">in a kind of openness and then when it</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.689" end="01:29:35.969" style="s2">up happening was I guess for my in my</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.599" end="01:29:38.820" style="s2">particular case two characteristics one</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.969" end="01:29:40.229" style="s2">was for a variety of reasons not the</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.820" end="01:29:41.070" style="s2">least of which is that my dad was a</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.229" end="01:29:43.739" style="s2">military man</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.070" end="01:29:46.949" style="s2">I built the substantial skillfulness in</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.739" end="01:29:48.300" style="s2">strategy how I showed up as being able</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.949" end="01:29:49.709" style="s2">to be in relationship with my dad was to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.300" end="01:29:51.899" style="s2">be really good at strategy like strategy</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.709" end="01:29:53.399" style="s2">games for example and the second was it</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.899" end="01:29:56.219" style="s2">turns out that nerd culture was on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.399" end="01:29:58.649" style="s2">ascendance so having a deep familiarity</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.219" end="01:30:02.879" style="s2">with and artfulness and say computers</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.649" end="01:30:05.909" style="s2">was really useful in 1994 so I could buy</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.879" end="01:30:08.389" style="s2">those two combined a high capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.909" end="01:30:12.030" style="s2">strategy with the high awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.389" end="01:30:13.590" style="s2">broad spectrum skillfulness in all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.030" end="01:30:14.550" style="s2">various aspects of nerd culture to begin</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.590" end="01:30:17.340" style="s2">getting into being a technology</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.550" end="01:30:19.050" style="s2">entrepreneur but never ever from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.340" end="01:30:21.090" style="s2">point of view of being a business man I</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.050" end="01:30:24.389" style="s2">have no interest whatsoever in that</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.090" end="01:30:25.860" style="s2">entire category the whole point has</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.389" end="01:30:28.169" style="s2">always been the thing that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.860" end="01:30:29.820" style="s2">about right now which I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.169" end="01:30:31.229" style="s2">connected to as far as I can tell which</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.820" end="01:30:32.939" style="s2">is actually a childhood level is</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.229" end="01:30:34.260" style="s2">literally just being able to enter into</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.939" end="01:30:36.300" style="s2">a space of collaboration otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.260" end="01:30:37.409" style="s2">entities playing with good friends so so</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.300" end="01:30:39.119" style="s2">then what ended up happening and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.409" end="01:30:41.039" style="s2">know if you paid attention to the bio</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.119" end="01:30:42.959" style="s2">but I was quite successful I actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.039" end="01:30:44.639" style="s2">achieved a certain meaningful level of</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.959" end="01:30:47.099" style="s2">success I took a company that I had</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.639" end="01:30:48.749" style="s2">specifically founded public on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.099" end="01:30:49.919" style="s2">Nasdaq and then it would ended up</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.749" end="01:30:52.649" style="s2">happening was that I was handed the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.919" end="01:30:54.869" style="s2">wonderful opportunity of feeling all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.649" end="01:30:56.519" style="s2">various traumas that I had not resolved</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.869" end="01:30:58.949" style="s2">sort of collapse on top of me all at</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.519" end="01:31:01.619" style="s2">once Jordan this has been an absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.949" end="01:31:03.539" style="s2">phenomenal conversation one of the</p>
