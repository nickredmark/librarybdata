<p begin="00:00:11.120" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">gift that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">gift yeah gift is</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">gift is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:22.720" style="s2">highest things we can do right i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.720" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">i qualify that by saying the gift with</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">no expectation of return</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">you take a part of your being</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">and you separate it from yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:42.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:45.680" style="s2">transfer it to another person</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.320" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">and sometimes a gift has conditions</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.680" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">and sometimes it does not</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">sometimes a gift has conditions if a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">gift has conditions then</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:01:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s part of a transaction is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.760" style="s2">not it&#39;s no longer a gift</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">so yes it seems like no expectation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">is is an essential component of gifting</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">differentiation between gift and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">transaction</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">by the lack of expectation</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">of reciprocity so giving a gift is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">as if it were the last thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">would do</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s nice giving a gift as though it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">were the last thing you would do that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">that is the ultimate expression of no</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">expectation of return i&#39;m just about to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">die here you go</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">well but then but then well i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">it anymore right i&#39;m going to die</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">therefore i can give it away and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no cost to me and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you give the gift</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">knowing that you&#39;re going to die is you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">you give knowing that you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">die in the next set second</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">beauty the transients</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">i mean that could be applied to every</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">action that you take</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">in your life right that should be taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">as though you could die in the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">moment and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">is this action worthy of your last act</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">on this earth</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s a bad way to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">so every action that we take is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">a gift if we put it in the right context</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">which is that this is potentially the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">thing that we do and so we cannot expect</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">nothing in return it would be foolhardy</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">that&#39;s right i could be dead there but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not therefore this moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">is a gift that&#39;s a really beautiful way</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">to look at every moment in your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">i could have died yesterday or five</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">minutes ago whatever but i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">i&#39;m still here</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">the gift of life which isn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">a gift or is it a life of great</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">is that a gift or is that a burden</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the great existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">questions isn&#39;t it is is is lo</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">is being worth it even in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">great suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a very good argument to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">be made that suffering is an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">consequence of life and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">bearing that suffering and living on</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">life as though it were a gift</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">anyway is suffering itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">a gift is death a gift</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">is genocide a gift or all these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">gifts</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">if we can learn from them are they</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">a gift from the future to the present</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">and given the inseparability of life</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">from death then life is no more than a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">gift than death is right they are they</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">equally valuable um in in in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">um just going back to the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">gift as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">a form of sacrifice right the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">giving of a a valuable piece of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">a piece of flesh a pound of flesh for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">pound of flesh</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">one pint of blood for a pint of blood</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a transactional nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">but then the gift is here is my hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">do what you will with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a boundary to these to the gift</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">and the transaction</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">something like giving blood you give</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">blood</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">not so that you have it for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">later you give blood into a pool but at</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">the same time you have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">expectation that should you require</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">blood</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">at some point you you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">contributed to that pool and thus you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">get access to that pool so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">gifting to the commons the commons is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">place that you can gift to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">maybe you will be gifted back but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">not it does not matter if you are lucky</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">you will not need the gift</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">of somebody else you will be blessed by</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">the that you do not need a gift</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">but if you need a gift</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">yeah gifting to the commons you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">need to give anything to anyone if</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">all that is produced all that is created</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">is immediately gifted to the commons and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">becomes accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">all yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">the gifting economy that&#39;s it done</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">but no one may lack for anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">and that they may be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">with an unexpected gift not something</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">that they needed but</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">some joy that they can receive a present</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">yeah where gifting becomes the normal</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">right and your status is determined not</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">how much you acquire but how much you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">give the the size of your contribution</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">to the commons is that which determines</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">your celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">if you like in the society right that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">what is honored</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">competition of giving</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">a competition of philanthropy you can be</p>
