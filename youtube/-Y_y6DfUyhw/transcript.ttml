<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">really appealed to us as a meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">imperative for our species and that for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">all evolutionarily minded m:9 inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:18.350" style="s2">value humans this is really our goal how</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">do we organize our activity as a species</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.350" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">towards the evolution of the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">effective viable fulfilling world system</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">for all and in order to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">question how do we get from here to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">there as effectively as possible we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">recognize that understanding the data</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">points of here and they are very well</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">with a first critical starting place and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">so when we look at what the data point</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">of here it is we started to inventory</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">what are all of the areas of need what</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">are all the areas of global problems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">this is all the problems in education</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">and in agriculture and then species</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">extinction and then fundamental flaws of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">economics and governance structures and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">all of that to really be able to deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">inventory what are all the areas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">need resource allocated to them</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:15.390" style="s2">we find that we have three primary areas</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">we look at what are the areas of human</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.390" end="00:02:18.990" style="s2">and environmental need that are already</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">being met to some level and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.990" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2">make sure that they continue to be met</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">at that level or higher as we you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.740" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">work with other things</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">what are existent problems that need</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">remediated and then the development of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:35.850" style="s2">new technologies and systems that can</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">meet needs at a higher level and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.850" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">found that there is no centralized</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:43.110" style="s2">inventory of what we as a species really</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">need to do to make life on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.110" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">viable for everybody that you end</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">inhabit the organization&#39;s did and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">they&#39;re a bunch of parts of it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.709" style="s2">different places and as much as many of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">us might have romanticized about if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.709" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">had the power to really make changes in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">the world what we&#39;d like to do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">realize that if we were in that position</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:02.160" style="s2">that we were profoundly under-informed</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">to actually know what needs done in what</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">timescales how to allocate resource to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">all of that with the most effective ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:11.239" style="s2">to go our and then this was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">information that we needed to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.239" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">you know great detail to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">that power and so whereas we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">inventory in problems or what you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">call more generally areas that need</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">resource allocated to them we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">we needed to develop the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:31.130" style="s2">metrics to be able to compare all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">issues and so we looked at metrics like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.130" end="00:03:36.390" style="s2">what the scope of any particular issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">was how much human life was affected by</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.390" end="00:03:40.049" style="s2">this issue directly and indirectly where</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">we specified what direct and indirect</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.049" end="00:03:44.519" style="s2">means how much non-human life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.200" style="s2">affected directly and indirectly what</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.519" end="00:03:47.700" style="s2">the magnitude of that effect is which</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.200" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">means how much quality of life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">affected we need to look at urgency</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">which is what are the timescales</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:56.700" style="s2">in which these issues have to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">addressed that if certain benchmarks</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.700" end="00:04:02.670" style="s2">aren&#39;t reached within the critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:05.070" style="s2">points of irreversible harm occur so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.670" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">that we so that you know the timelines</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.070" end="00:04:08.390" style="s2">in which we have to address these things</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">how are all the different problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.390" end="00:04:12.299" style="s2">interconnected so this particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">problem feeds into all these other ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.299" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">so we can see that agriculture and soil</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">issues feed into water table issues for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:21.260" style="s2">instance and that these issues are also</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:23.540" style="s2">fed into by everything from economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.260" end="00:04:26.270" style="s2">make issues to issues with pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.540" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">and genetically modified processes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.270" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">all these things so for any issue what</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:31.130" style="s2">are all the areas that feed into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">we&#39;re all there is it feed out of it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.130" end="00:04:34.780" style="s2">that as we&#39;re looking at resource</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.920" style="s2">allocation we can start to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.780" end="00:04:38.930" style="s2">complexity of the interaction of how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.920" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">address something making sure that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.930" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t externalize harm to other areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:45.170" style="s2">inadvertently and that we&#39;ve maximized</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:47.570" style="s2">the externalization of positives to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.170" end="00:04:49.220" style="s2">other areas and that we can see how as</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.570" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">we work on any part of it how that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.220" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">affects the systemic overall evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.370" style="s2">of the whole which is really our goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">and then we also look at the etiology of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.370" end="00:04:59.000" style="s2">each of these issues how those issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:00.920" style="s2">came into being and what the political</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.000" end="00:05:01.910" style="s2">components are and the economic vested</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.920" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">interest components and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.910" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">technological components and social</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:07.340" style="s2">value system components and all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:09.190" style="s2">levels of cause and effect that has to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">be addressed for an issue to really be</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.190" end="00:05:13.400" style="s2">fundamentally resolved and so when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:14.900" style="s2">address all the levels of cause and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.400" end="00:05:16.670" style="s2">effect and we address all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.900" end="00:05:19.030" style="s2">interconnection then we really are</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.670" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">looking at fundamentally viable</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.030" end="00:05:24.410" style="s2">solutions and one of the reasons we got</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:26.120" style="s2">into this was because of a background in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.410" end="00:05:28.190" style="s2">many different areas of activism and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.120" end="00:05:30.830" style="s2">seeing how much problems were mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.190" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">just moved because they didn&#39;t address</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:35.660" style="s2">all the levels of cause and effect and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:39.110" style="s2">all the interconnections and how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.660" end="00:05:40.820" style="s2">well intentioned activist I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.110" end="00:05:43.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a deep enough understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:44.750" style="s2">of the problems how they all</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.160" end="00:05:46.850" style="s2">interconnect and deep enough strategy</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.750" end="00:05:48.530" style="s2">involved to really be truly affected and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.850" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">we want to make sure that all good</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.530" end="00:05:54.980" style="s2">intentioned heartfelt action is backed</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:56.480" style="s2">by the most intelligent strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.980" end="00:06:00.650" style="s2">really produce the best results with</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.480" end="00:06:03.500" style="s2">just you know all of our goal and so all</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.650" end="00:06:05.450" style="s2">of these metrics for what we can call</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">the problems end up serving as a basis</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.450" end="00:06:09.110" style="s2">for being able to evaluate most</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:11.300" style="s2">effective strategies and best practices</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.110" end="00:06:13.820" style="s2">which then we also start to inventory</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.300" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">what are all of the solutions to be able</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:19.160" style="s2">whether all the solutions have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">proposed so far and how to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.160" end="00:06:23.390" style="s2">look at the input to output ratios for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">all these solutions how much resource it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.390" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">takes to do a particular solution for</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">how much measurable change comes out of</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.930" style="s2">we&#39;ll change globally when we factor how</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.140" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">it intersects everything else and so our</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:41.880" style="s2">goal then is to be able to have the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:43.710" style="s2">effective strategies in their particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.880" end="00:06:45.390" style="s2">area and the strategies that have the</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.620" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">have strategy guilds and so as we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:06:59.400" style="s2">we&#39;re inventory the problems in</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.400" end="00:07:02.700" style="s2">inventory what are the physical</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.700" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">this planet and this is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:08.490" style="s2">things like the reusability of waste</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:10.320" style="s2">streams what we currently call waste</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.490" end="00:07:11.940" style="s2">with you know our current and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.320" end="00:07:13.380" style="s2">developing technologies available as</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.940" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">well as the things traditionally called</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.380" end="00:07:19.650" style="s2">resource because we need to know what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:21.450" style="s2">have to work with resource wise what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.650" end="00:07:23.880" style="s2">have to work with strategy wise which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.450" end="00:07:26.190" style="s2">what converts resources into meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:31.290" style="s2">needs and what the needs are and all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.190" end="00:07:33.510" style="s2">this together informs also an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.290" end="00:07:35.340" style="s2">of what the sustainable carrying</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.510" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">capacity for our planet is which right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.340" end="00:07:41.550" style="s2">now is guessed at at best and the guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">is very hugely from a population much</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.550" end="00:07:44.670" style="s2">less than what we currently have to more</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">than what we currently have this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.670" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">very important thing that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:50.460" style="s2">know as we move forward and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.460" style="s2">that the carrying capacity is not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.460" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">fixed number but is a range that&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.460" end="00:07:59.970" style="s2">on how efficient the technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:02.520" style="s2">for for moving resources into meant</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.970" end="00:08:07.110" style="s2">needs how high a quality of life is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.520" end="00:08:10.680" style="s2">being met and you know as several</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.110" end="00:08:13.310" style="s2">factors and so this is all part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.680" end="00:08:13.310" style="s2">project at work</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.639" end="00:08:25.769" style="s2">so the next data point is getting clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.919" end="00:08:28.379" style="s2">on the there which is where are we going</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.769" end="00:08:30.719" style="s2">where do we want to be going and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.379" end="00:08:33.949" style="s2">activism and in governance so far</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.719" end="00:08:36.269" style="s2">oftentimes we are moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.949" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">problems we&#39;re in reaction to but</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.269" end="00:08:40.829" style="s2">without a very clear awareness of what a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.729" end="00:08:44.779" style="s2">truly functional model would look like</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.829" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">and so we started asking questions like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.779" end="00:08:51.629" style="s2">if we were going to redesign human</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">society and human civilization from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.629" end="00:08:56.699" style="s2">ground up today without assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:08:58.559" style="s2">any of the ways that we have done things</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.699" end="00:08:59.809" style="s2">so far necessarily the best ways to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.559" end="00:09:03.240" style="s2">proceed</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.809" end="00:09:06.899" style="s2">they might possibly be but really being</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.240" end="00:09:08.699" style="s2">able to inventory the starting with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.899" end="00:09:10.259" style="s2">best of everything we know of of Science</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.699" end="00:09:12.509" style="s2">and Technology and all like that today</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.259" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">what the best ways of meaning human</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.509" end="00:09:16.439" style="s2">needs in conjunction with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.459" style="s2">environment harmoniously would be how</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.439" end="00:09:19.259" style="s2">would we do how do we design</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.459" end="00:09:20.699" style="s2">civilization what would education look</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.259" end="00:09:22.889" style="s2">like well the transportation look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.699" end="00:09:25.319" style="s2">if we weren&#39;t trying to retrofit maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.889" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">fundamentally flawed system but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.319" end="00:09:29.819" style="s2">designing it starting with starting from</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:32.629" style="s2">scratch starting with the best of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.819" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">everything that we know now and with the</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:41.029" style="s2">to evolve as quickly as possible with</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.009" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">the input of new better strategies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.029" end="00:09:45.389" style="s2">so that we could really develop a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.290" end="00:09:47.490" style="s2">blueprint and of course an ever evolving</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.389" end="00:09:49.589" style="s2">blueprint that gets to synthesize the</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.589" end="00:10:00.120" style="s2">where we are wanting to move and so our</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.329" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2">approach has looked like like this with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.120" end="00:10:04.620" style="s2">regard to governance models for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.000" end="00:10:07.500" style="s2">and governance in the most general sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.620" end="00:10:09.420" style="s2">means how we collectively make decisions</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.420" end="00:10:13.620" style="s2">how to best go about doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.970" end="00:10:14.939" style="s2">governance in general is different than</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.530" end="00:12:25.460" style="s2">and then also to look at what we know</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.460" end="00:12:29.900" style="s2">systems from other systems like</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.950" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">more of a kind of a bottom-up emergent</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:55.150" style="s2">them so we have kind of a biomimicry for</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.510" end="00:12:58.690" style="s2">social design and all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.150" end="00:13:00.520" style="s2">speaking to how to apply the scientific</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.520" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">science which is an opinion divested</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.390" end="00:13:13.630" style="s2">this is what Carl Sagan and Buckminster</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:15.400" style="s2">Fuller and Jacque fresco and many have</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.630" end="00:13:16.870" style="s2">talked about as being fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.400" end="00:13:19.150" style="s2">necessary for a long time there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.870" end="00:13:21.630" style="s2">really a Republican versus a Democrat or</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.150" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">a capitalist versus a communist way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:25.990" style="s2">cleaning dirty water or bringing water</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">to people that need it there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.990" end="00:13:29.770" style="s2">less effective ways of doing that in</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.620" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">and so how do we have a governance</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.830" end="00:13:41.640" style="s2">system that is as opinion divested as</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:45.130" style="s2">possible as fact-based as possible as</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.640" end="00:13:47.890" style="s2">aamna inclusive in the goal of what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.130" end="00:13:50.410" style="s2">is that we&#39;re working on as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.890" end="00:13:52.690" style="s2">and so this is you know really what</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.410" end="00:13:54.850" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at and obviously then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.690" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">question is what really is the goal what</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.850" end="00:13:59.800" style="s2">do we call quality of life and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.890" end="00:14:01.480" style="s2">very deep topic that we also look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.800" end="00:14:03.430" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about maximizing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.480" end="00:14:05.290" style="s2">possibility for quality of life for all</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.430" end="00:14:07.930" style="s2">life what are the metrics that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.290" end="00:14:10.510" style="s2">looking to optimize because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.930" end="00:14:13.060" style="s2">GDP is not a good metric and then GDP</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.510" end="00:14:15.880" style="s2">per capita is not a good metric if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.060" end="00:14:19.270" style="s2">really looking at you know individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.880" end="00:14:21.190" style="s2">happiness and an interpersonal happiness</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.270" end="00:14:24.820" style="s2">and sustainability with the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.190" end="00:14:26.620" style="s2">so the goal is to be able to look at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.820" end="00:14:28.360" style="s2">of the different possible relevant</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.620" end="00:14:30.490" style="s2">metrics how they intersect each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.360" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">and bring them into an integral picture</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.490" end="00:14:35.200" style="s2">that&#39;s able to factor all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:35.770" style="s2">continuously factor new variables and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.200" end="00:14:38.110" style="s2">metrics</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.770" end="00:14:41.380" style="s2">so it&#39;s an elastically updatable system</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.110" end="00:14:43.780" style="s2">to give us the most comprehensive basis</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.380" end="00:14:45.640" style="s2">of what we&#39;re seeking to optimize so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.780" end="00:14:46.960" style="s2">want to look at when we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.640" end="00:14:48.670" style="s2">maximizing quality of life we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.960" end="00:14:50.250" style="s2">look at subjective metrics people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:51.390" style="s2">reporting of their own happiness</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.250" end="00:14:53.010" style="s2">all the different dimensions of life</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.390" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">which is their their happiness in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.010" end="00:14:58.350" style="s2">sense of creativity and contribution and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:00.120" style="s2">personal relationships and all like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.350" end="00:15:03.530" style="s2">and we also want to look at objective</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.120" end="00:15:05.850" style="s2">metrics which is we look at things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.530" end="00:15:06.990" style="s2">suicide rate and mental illness rate and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.850" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">crime rate and all the different things</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.990" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">that that look at both how functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:14.700" style="s2">the system is from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">individuals from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.700" end="00:15:18.030" style="s2">how individuals interact from the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.500" end="00:15:19.980" style="s2">of view of how whole societies and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.030" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">communities interact with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.980" end="00:15:24.330" style="s2">how they interact with the ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:27.090" style="s2">sustainability and then we also look at</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.330" end="00:15:29.190" style="s2">factors involving time do we want people</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.090" end="00:15:31.160" style="s2">that are happy now and not really</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:33.630" style="s2">motivated to evolve over people that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.160" end="00:15:36.330" style="s2">involving motivated by discontent and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.630" end="00:15:39.630" style="s2">obviously we care about both happiness</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.330" end="00:15:41.970" style="s2">now and evolution into ever higher</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.630" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">possibilities of happiness and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.970" end="00:15:46.050" style="s2">expression of human potential so how do</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">we maximize both of these simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.050" end="00:15:52.380" style="s2">and how do we answer all of this in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:53.460" style="s2">collective way that pulls the best of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.380" end="00:15:56.100" style="s2">everything that we know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.460" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2">empirically founded that&#39;s opinion</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.100" end="00:16:02.910" style="s2">divested and where we and what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:04.530" style="s2">know for sure how do we set up social</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.910" end="00:16:06.630" style="s2">experiments to really be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.530" end="00:16:09.390" style="s2">determine these things as best as</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.630" end="00:16:11.310" style="s2">possible and feed back and forth that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:13.200" style="s2">ground-up social experiments to a</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.200" end="00:16:21.240" style="s2">regarding these topics so critical path</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.780" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">analysis is looking at how we get from</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:27.210" style="s2">here to there for any particular here</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:29.100" style="s2">and there factoring many variables in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.210" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">complex system and we look at which</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.100" end="00:16:32.640" style="s2">things can happen simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:34.380" style="s2">independent of each other which things</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.640" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">have to happen subsequently because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.380" end="00:16:38.700" style="s2">depend upon the results of previous set</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.860" style="s2">of action and how do how do we allocate</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.700" end="00:16:43.230" style="s2">the total amount of resources we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.860" end="00:16:45.300" style="s2">each area in light of how that maximizes</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.230" end="00:16:48.420" style="s2">the systemic movement and what are the</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.420" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">the utilization of that resource in each</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.339" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">area and all this comes together to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:57.180" style="s2">critical path now when we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:59.370" style="s2">the critical path for humanity&#39;s success</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.180" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a dynamic critical path because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.370" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">here points is continuously changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">as our global problems and global needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.290" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">change and this can happen in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:09.540" style="s2">unpredicted ways all the time and a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:11.790" style="s2">earthquake occurs and now we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.540" end="00:17:13.230" style="s2">able to look at those resource needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.790" end="00:17:14.699" style="s2">allocated it&#39;s dealing with that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:16.530" style="s2">that means resources being taken from</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.699" end="00:17:19.020" style="s2">somewhere else and yet we still have all</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.530" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">of our comprehensive goals how do we</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.020" end="00:17:24.510" style="s2">really optimize that process so we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:27.150" style="s2">a continuously changing here point and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.510" end="00:17:28.980" style="s2">it continues changing their point as new</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.150" end="00:17:31.380" style="s2">technologies emerge in new social</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.980" end="00:17:34.440" style="s2">understandings emerged to where what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.380" end="00:17:36.390" style="s2">best of what&#39;s possible for societal</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.440" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">design this keeps changing and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.390" end="00:17:43.020" style="s2">we elastically upgrade and update our</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">critical path with the input of all new</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.020" end="00:17:48.840" style="s2">relevant information to where we know</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">what we need to be doing now that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">most effective towards the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">long-range goals and all of our timely</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:57.750" style="s2">goals and that what we&#39;re doing now is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:18:01.290" style="s2">continuously optimized in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.750" end="00:18:03.090" style="s2">input of all new real information and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.290" end="00:18:04.710" style="s2">this requires a lot of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.090" end="00:18:07.190" style="s2">factoring and so this is another thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.710" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">that we&#39;ve looked at which is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:14.280" style="s2">see how a particular problem relates to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">problems in other areas and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.280" end="00:18:18.419" style="s2">unintuitive a as when we only take a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">specialist approach and how does a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.419" end="00:18:22.260" style="s2">particular solution there end up</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">affecting other areas because we can see</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.260" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">sometimes in solving a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">problem in particular way we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">actually externalize harm to another</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:32.900" style="s2">area unanticipated ly like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:36.360" style="s2">when we were working to get off of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.900" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">foreign oil by creating biofuels but in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.360" end="00:18:39.900" style="s2">the process creating biofuels from</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:42.750" style="s2">agricultural sources that created</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.900" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">environmental damage we want we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.750" end="00:18:45.990" style="s2">be able to make sure that as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:47.640" style="s2">solving a particular problem we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.990" end="00:18:49.260" style="s2">externalizing that harm somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.640" end="00:18:51.419" style="s2">so this requires a cross-sectoral</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.260" end="00:18:53.010" style="s2">analysis and have a functional</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.419" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">cross-sectoral analysis we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.010" end="00:18:55.500" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking at all the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:58.590" style="s2">sectors appropriately we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.500" end="00:19:02.549" style="s2">what all the sectors are this requires a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:04.470" style="s2">taxonomy of all of the issues that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.549" end="00:19:09.990" style="s2">looking at and how they all interrelate</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.470" end="00:19:12.900" style="s2">to each other and then how our our goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.990" end="00:19:15.299" style="s2">is to be able to have solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.900" end="00:19:15.630" style="s2">both optimized for their particular area</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:44.600" style="s2">the broadest sense the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.550" end="00:21:47.270" style="s2">evolution is ordering complexity higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.600" end="00:21:49.640" style="s2">orders of complexity which is two things</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.270" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">it&#39;s more parts that are involved more</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.640" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">complexity and ordering that if we get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">more complex system without adequate</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">order we end up just getting more</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.820" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">entropy and into grades to the last</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">level and so if we look at a cell a cell</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">has all of the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:08.030" style="s2">component molecules that make it up but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:11.870" style="s2">they&#39;re arranged in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.030" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">that if we just had all of the molecules</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.870" end="00:22:14.990" style="s2">that make up a cell thrown in a petri</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:16.160" style="s2">dish it wouldn&#39;t be a cellular just be a</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.160" end="00:22:20.780" style="s2">interesting when you arrange it when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.230" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">order it that togetherness is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.780" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">allows the cell to respirate and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:27.740" style="s2">replicate even though none of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">on their own do that and those emergent</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.740" end="00:22:33.260" style="s2">properties come from ordering the parts</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">into a whole and you know we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.260" end="00:22:38.179" style="s2">the same way in terms of a nervous</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:40.700" style="s2">system and no neuron by itself thinks or</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.179" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">feels it has a particular fire encoder</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.700" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">but when you order the firing pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:45.380" style="s2">all those neurons together in the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:48.650" style="s2">that the human brain and nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.380" end="00:22:52.370" style="s2">works you get sentience and you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.650" end="00:22:55.940" style="s2">eyeness and consciousness well in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.370" end="00:22:59.179" style="s2">same way we have as all of the many</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.940" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">neurons are connected in our brain to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.179" end="00:23:02.450" style="s2">create human consciousness and all of</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.450" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">pattern to create a human organism we</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.940" end="00:23:09.710" style="s2">have all of these cells of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:13.190" style="s2">on this planet that when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.710" end="00:23:15.770" style="s2">ordered is basically just like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.190" end="00:23:17.870" style="s2">bunch of cells separately which is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.770" end="00:23:20.059" style="s2">that interesting but when their</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.870" end="00:23:22.850" style="s2">activities are ordered together in light</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.890" end="00:23:37.550" style="s2">global operating system is kind of a</p>
