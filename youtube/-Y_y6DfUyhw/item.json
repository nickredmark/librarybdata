    "description": "What if the next US President committed to utilizing a global governance system like this for informing policy? Imagine what would become possible then...now we are talking real, positive change.\n\nNote: This is an incomplete introduction, but should be enough to start an interesting conversation. We would much appreciate any constructive feedback for how to make the upcoming, more complete version better.\n\nIf this vision inspires you, please share this video far and wide and feel free to upload it to your own channel or website, as long as you include a link to this location in the first paragraph of your description. Thank you :)\n\nI also recommend this brief article by Daniel about \"The Obsolescence of Representatives\" and the validity of digital direct democracy: http://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-schmachtenberger/the-obsolescence-of-representatives/10151074847255213.\n\nMore to come, subscribe to this channel to get notified.\n\nPS: The uploader  - me - is not formally involved with this organization, only fully committed to supporting this vision in every way I can.",
