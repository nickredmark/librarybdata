<p begin="00:00:17.290" end="00:00:21.700" style="s2">part of the outcome is something that</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.700" end="00:00:32.590" style="s2">threw away my previous speech and penned</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.090" end="00:00:39.370" style="s2">what came to me in the middle of the</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.370" end="00:00:50.200" style="s2">said very greatly there&#39;s no better</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.080" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">place to begin the word commence means</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.200" end="00:00:59.200" style="s2">to begin so here we are at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:03.670" style="s2">it really has taken some time for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.200" end="00:01:06.400" style="s2">get here Charles</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.670" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">our academic coordinator likes to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:12.490" style="s2">that unlike the goal of the learning and</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.490" end="00:01:19.660" style="s2">studies we get on with the unlearning</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.740" end="00:01:23.020" style="s2">and the unthinking of things hence it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.660" end="00:01:27.850" style="s2">seems very appropriate that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.020" end="00:01:33.729" style="s2">of things we find ourselves here just</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.850" end="00:01:35.319" style="s2">right at the beginning I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.729" end="00:01:37.929" style="s2">if we were to walk out of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.319" end="00:01:40.810" style="s2">auditorium and sit down with a palm</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.929" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">reader or soothsayer our fortune teller</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.810" end="00:01:48.610" style="s2">right now before our lives got too</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:52.959" style="s2">settled in a new rut perhaps there would</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.610" end="00:01:57.880" style="s2">be no past for her to see and so no</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.959" end="00:02:00.729" style="s2">future for her to tell nothing left</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.880" end="00:02:03.940" style="s2">would be carved in the stone of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.729" end="00:02:08.880" style="s2">memories and everything would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.940" end="00:02:14.940" style="s2">possible everything should be possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.880" end="00:02:18.670" style="s2">from here in my work we have a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.940" end="00:02:22.060" style="s2">starting position we ask people to throw</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.670" end="00:02:24.689" style="s2">away all their preconceived agreements</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.060" end="00:02:27.849" style="s2">about roles and rules and path</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.689" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">dependencies and basically to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.849" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">about their governance as a starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.330" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">starting position that&#39;s the phrase we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">use it means that whenever you find</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">yourself wherever you are you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:48.620" style="s2">you&#39;re here just in the right place at</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:52.320" style="s2">your starting position</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.620" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">well we my friends Charles and Bharti</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.320" end="00:03:00.420" style="s2">and Dave and Brian we are consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">studies graduates so I could have said</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">all that in a fancier way I could have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">told you about process philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">explained why there are more potentials</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">in the past than in the future although</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:16.830" style="s2">the future potentials are infinite they</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">are not exhaustible I could have derived</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.830" end="00:03:22.890" style="s2">from this cosmological asymmetry why</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:25.170" style="s2">this means there are more actuals to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.890" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">realized in the future than could have</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.170" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">ever been realized in the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">despite this negative correlation with</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">potentials remember the elephants I</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">would say there will never be a time</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:45.980" style="s2">when there were never any of them which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">only means there will never be a time</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.980" end="00:03:54.570" style="s2">when there was never a you or a me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:58.709" style="s2">that makes a difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.570" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a really big deal each one of us is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.709" end="00:04:05.100" style="s2">a unique part of this starting position</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">here on planet Earth in a galaxy that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.100" end="00:04:16.980" style="s2">embraces all we can see and echoes all</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:26.450" style="s2">we say remind me again this moment is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.980" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">time unlike any other this moment - well</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.450" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">I am really not much for formalities or</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:36.690" style="s2">pageantry like this commencement</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:39.270" style="s2">ceremony but I confess to holding a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.690" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">little rituals out at the farm where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.270" end="00:04:43.699" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">for example I walk the dogs to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.699" end="00:04:54.009" style="s2">mailbox every day at 1:30 and when I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:54.009" style="s2">I sing who wants to go to the mailbox</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.669" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">it&#39;s my dogs version of pomp and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.620" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.949" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">perhaps walking to the mailbox is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:09.050" style="s2">their goal the mailbox is not really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">their thing it&#39;s the walking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.050" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">camaraderie the chance to be together</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">the chance to be a we we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:22.719" style="s2">this just this past week with an</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:26.389" style="s2">incoming cohort in consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.719" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">the question posed the question I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.389" end="00:05:37.789" style="s2">put forth today is how big is your we</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.949" end="00:05:48.229" style="s2">in my barn they think the only way out</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:52.669" style="s2">is where the light shines through those</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.229" end="00:05:57.050" style="s2">closed windows are not the way out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.669" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2">toward the lower dark barn entry that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.050" end="00:06:06.830" style="s2">they must go that&#39;s an allegory that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.150" end="00:06:09.650" style="s2">seems relevant to me today that and the</p>
