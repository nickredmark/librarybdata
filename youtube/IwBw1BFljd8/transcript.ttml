<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">thinking is like moving through space</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:21.779" style="s2">and thus altering what we&#39;re thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:25.789" style="s2">like being realizing attention and</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">about how we&#39;re going to operationalize</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:59.409" style="s2">I filled you in on the other side the</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.340" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">soul framework did present a challenge</p>

<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:02:59.209" style="s2">as fixation and since there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.620" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">such thing as inside we then took a look</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.620" end="00:03:11.650" style="s2">first at theoretical difficulties with</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:15.019" style="s2">that argument we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.650" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">difficulties concerning Weisberg and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.019" end="00:03:20.570" style="s2">those alternative which was</p>

<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">and therefore circulars in plain sight</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.060" end="00:03:48.109" style="s2">an important point we&#39;re going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">coming back to we&#39;ve answered a look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.109" end="00:03:54.170" style="s2">Alan&#39;s point that is highly unlikely the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">answer to a problem is we found in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.170" end="00:03:57.879" style="s2">integrated fashion somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.930" end="00:03:59.019" style="s2">memory is much more probable that</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:15.129" style="s2">etc so that will on special is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.340" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">properly addressed we then took a look</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.129" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">at work it&#39;s on us he pointed out that</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.669" end="00:04:34.810" style="s2">has to be overcome in order to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.539" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">problem for example instead probably the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">case that there are many different</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">interacting constraints or issues that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:43.060" style="s2">have to be simultaneously or a</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:53.729" style="s2">welcome back to look that specifically</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:58.449" style="s2">later works like a shop and also finally</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.729" end="00:05:01.419" style="s2">we took a look at the fact that wiser</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.449" end="00:05:03.789" style="s2">than always clue think outside the box</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.419" end="00:05:06.550" style="s2">may not be the right type of clue</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.789" end="00:05:09.729" style="s2">because it being propositional in nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">whereas the process in change that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.729" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">needed is procedural in nature it may</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:17.409" style="s2">not be inference of propositions it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:19.750" style="s2">means better to be attention that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.409" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">altering the salient kind of like what</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.750" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">the consultants is arguing and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">might be the relevant issues that need</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:29.409" style="s2">to happen in order for inflation curve</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:33.130" style="s2">and that is why the procedural cube by</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.409" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">Councilman admirer was facilitating for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.130" end="00:05:37.270" style="s2">solving the nine problems in contrast to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:45.190" style="s2">whites were the all black</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.270" end="00:05:49.000" style="s2">failed okay any questions about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.190" end="00:05:50.710" style="s2">before we move on we talked a long way</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.000" end="00:05:52.539" style="s2">of a lot of things like graphic</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.710" end="00:05:53.889" style="s2">suddenness versus for on logical side</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.539" end="00:05:55.260" style="s2">note so these issues we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.889" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">that the court arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.260" end="00:06:03.860" style="s2">anything else that be addressed alright</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:07.400" style="s2">so now I want to turn to the</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.400" end="00:06:11.430" style="s2">because what i&#39;m trying to get and show</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.230" end="00:06:27.330" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see how it interacts with the</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.330" end="00:06:34.640" style="s2">competition begins primarily well with</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.900" end="00:06:43.260" style="s2">went on to I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.080" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">looking our she&#39;s retired that Metcalf</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.110" end="00:06:58.320" style="s2">that this is one of the first areas</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:06:59.730" style="s2">where fear God is initially loose so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.320" end="00:07:03.780" style="s2">Janet madcap we&#39;re going to take a look</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.730" end="00:07:04.950" style="s2">at three externally okay and now the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.780" end="00:07:06.690" style="s2">thing you have to remember about the</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.729" end="00:08:04.810" style="s2">lightly this satisfying right and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.460" end="00:08:06.490" style="s2">we&#39;ll get into the four for the third</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">experiment and then we can sort of take</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.490" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">it as summation now of course along the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:12.039" style="s2">way you&#39;re free to ask their application</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">questions in they challenge questions I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.039" end="00:08:16.349" style="s2">just wanted to forewarn you of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.810" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">habanero this way to unfold all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.349" end="00:08:22.449" style="s2">okay let&#39;s take a look at the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:23.979" style="s2">experiment which is 1986 1986 a because</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.449" end="00:08:26.050" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start with two experiments</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.979" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">to set up or at a different time so did</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.050" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">not get music so Metcalf 1986 a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.440" end="00:08:48.910" style="s2">no this experiment like I said seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.319" end="00:08:50.829" style="s2">like it suggested to I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.910" end="00:08:53.139" style="s2">where here of career magnetic cognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.829" end="00:08:54.819" style="s2">really started to take off because she</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.139" end="00:08:59.230" style="s2">was going to make use of a metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.819" end="00:09:01.990" style="s2">probe in order to study in session so 30</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.230" end="00:09:08.319" style="s2">seconds a day we don&#39;t have all of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.990" end="00:09:10.300" style="s2">sophisticated machinery fMRI and EEG all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.319" end="00:09:13.449" style="s2">everyone didn&#39;t have that in 86</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.300" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">so probing cognitive processes requires</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.449" end="00:09:21.910" style="s2">a quite a bit of experimental cleverness</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:24.310" style="s2">so what met HAP uses is she uses a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:30.310" style="s2">cognitive probe upon ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.310" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">metacognitive probe and what a probe is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.310" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">right it&#39;s an independently studied and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:42.670" style="s2">replicated and confirmed phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:44.829" style="s2">you can be reliably confident is</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.670" end="00:09:48.250" style="s2">operating in a certain manner so here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.019" end="00:10:01.000" style="s2">department we even have cards it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:04.180" style="s2">the cartoon exist I mean you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.000" end="00:10:05.709" style="s2">psychology department parties and one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.180" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">the things you have to do is you get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.709" end="00:10:11.589" style="s2">talk about you know feed with points or</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:12.610" style="s2">five so that the bogus Percy right the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.589" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">other one of the other things you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.610" end="00:10:17.470" style="s2">to be able to talk about about the drop</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:19.750" style="s2">of the Hat is just rude about the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.470" end="00:10:20.889" style="s2">studied phenomenon in psychology I kid</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.750" end="00:10:23.319" style="s2">you not this has been actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.889" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">investigated empirically call deposit in</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.319" end="00:10:29.559" style="s2">the 90s there are review of all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">troop effects in the 90 that was all</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.559" end="00:10:37.660" style="s2">read to like I think 500 it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:41.439" style="s2">ongoing this it&#39;s my favorite example</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.660" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">since I proposed is that a study</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.439" end="00:10:46.600" style="s2">entitled the following the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:48.459" style="s2">lunch on the strip of veteran apparently</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.600" end="00:10:51.490" style="s2">you have lunch the Stroop effect isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.459" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">just that I don&#39;t know that all civilian</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.490" end="00:10:54.450" style="s2">talks about the Stroop effect I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:57.460" style="s2">that&#39;s just a general property of lunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.450" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">but very well steady phenomena okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.460" end="00:11:00.910" style="s2">you know what the strip of that is and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:02.590" style="s2">because you know how to operate and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.910" end="00:11:04.540" style="s2">is how accused it uses a probe what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.590" end="00:11:07.060" style="s2">do is get interactive of the processes</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.540" end="00:11:08.500" style="s2">seeing other processes effect it cetera</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.060" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">and then that will tell you something</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.500" end="00:11:14.260" style="s2">about those processes so for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:17.620" style="s2">because the shoe perfected such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.260" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">reliable Pro about the automaticity of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.620" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">processing amir as was able to use the</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">provide some of the first clear evidence</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.790" end="00:11:34.990" style="s2">okay how did you do that why is the you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.540" style="s2">canada researcher because what is was</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.990" end="00:11:39.100" style="s2">hypnotized people and told them when</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.540" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">they&#39;re looking through the words to not</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.100" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">pay attention to the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:46.390" style="s2">words but only to the color and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:48.010" style="s2">can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t placebo that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:49.930" style="s2">because of the automaticity of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.010" end="00:11:53.320" style="s2">Stroop effect and when you can show</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.930" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">reliably replicated like three times is</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.320" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">that if people aren&#39;t properly</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:12:00.670" style="s2">hypnotized they can significantly reduce</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:02.110" style="s2">the sugar back there you go so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.670" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">understand how a cognitive robots</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.110" end="00:12:07.000" style="s2">because wow hypnosis must be real</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.470" style="s2">because it can really change the Stroop</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.000" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">effect mr. professors with real</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.470" end="00:12:17.860" style="s2">phenomena so it gets become famous in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:22.030" style="s2">the next week I live in Christ okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.860" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">she was doing the same thing like rats</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.030" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">uses the Stroop effect to study hypnosis</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:34.330" style="s2">she was using feeling of knowing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:36.190" style="s2">study inside ok so feeling of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.330" end="00:12:37.690" style="s2">it&#39;s always pronounced even though we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.190" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">have this acronym it&#39;s always pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.690" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">fearing of going for obvious reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">open up the acronym</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.640" end="00:12:51.690" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll be up okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">or feeling of knowing now here is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.690" end="00:12:54.930" style="s2">basic idea of personal what is feeling</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:56.850" style="s2">of knowin feeling of knowing is if I ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.930" end="00:12:59.399" style="s2">you something and you can&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.850" end="00:13:01.050" style="s2">answer me you will often get a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.399" end="00:13:02.279" style="s2">that you nevertheless know it how many</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.050" end="00:13:05.339" style="s2">of you know what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.279" end="00:13:06.420" style="s2">okay so just a bit of research dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.339" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve been quite a big display the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.420" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">research done by the time that covers in</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">this experiment that&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:15.510" style="s2">accurate thing you have your feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:18.149" style="s2">knowing is a quite good predictor of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.510" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">the fact that you will later be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.149" end="00:13:23.070" style="s2">produce these information so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:25.020" style="s2">like a lot of we get lots of feelings</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.070" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">with no tracking we need to know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.020" end="00:13:29.160" style="s2">your confidence in your memory is not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">measure of how accurate to measure how</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">meaningful it is so you&#39;re gonna call I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:37.670" style="s2">know this what&#39;s the person who shot</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:40.080" style="s2">Agnes I swear toward others other person</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.670" end="00:13:41.430" style="s2">because reconstructive nature of memory</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.080" end="00:13:45.029" style="s2">blah blah blah you darling</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.430" end="00:13:45.930" style="s2">okay black I like that I like your</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.029" end="00:13:48.839" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.930" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">respect meaningful the information to</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:01.560" style="s2">to write and it&#39;s reliable its robust</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.180" end="00:14:05.029" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s one of the peelings</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.560" end="00:14:07.500" style="s2">you&#39;ll have good reason to trust whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.029" end="00:14:09.420" style="s2">you should not trust your confidence in</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.850" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">not the same at me else to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.230" end="00:15:14.200" style="s2">produce this is out that all right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">here with the idea yes in terms of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.200" end="00:15:20.410" style="s2">confidence and I radiate meaningful</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.830" end="00:15:28.780" style="s2">related to your feeling of knowing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:30.790" style="s2">could be they doesn&#39;t seem to be that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.780" end="00:15:33.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s generally tracking so</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.130" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">train yourself as what you&#39;re said no</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.990" end="00:15:39.190" style="s2">I&#39;m saying like what if anyone is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:43.480" style="s2">generally like what did you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.190" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2">um like I mean you can say that your</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.480" end="00:15:49.180" style="s2">content that lefteris are act but at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">same time it&#39;s because of a feeling of</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.080" end="00:15:59.470" style="s2">so generally yes generally the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.620" end="00:16:01.450" style="s2">of insert sort generally that&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.470" end="00:16:02.830" style="s2">case but I can&#39;t say to you that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:16.780" style="s2">going because they actually remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">what you do you like example classical I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.780" end="00:16:24.100" style="s2">mean if you give people a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:26.440" style="s2">thoughts happens so and then what you do</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.100" end="00:16:27.760" style="s2">is you show them a dot pattern that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.440" end="00:16:29.830" style="s2">have never been presented that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.760" end="00:16:31.960" style="s2">represents a mathematical average of all</p>

<p begin="00:16:33.430" end="00:16:38.230" style="s2">before even though they never did so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.220" end="00:16:39.940" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t they had not learned it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.230" end="00:16:42.010" style="s2">they have a high confidence with it they</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.940" end="00:16:44.050" style="s2">have seen it before because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.010" end="00:16:46.390" style="s2">tracking how much previous information</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.050" end="00:16:51.100" style="s2">can be meaningfully integrated to make</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.100" end="00:16:55.840" style="s2">opposite which is what you want I can I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.400" style="s2">deny that in some instances the</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.400" end="00:17:03.100" style="s2">building up again tonight what hang on</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.730" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">is there like as a natural fiber you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.100" end="00:17:07.090" style="s2">just wanted to make that point you make</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:08.700" style="s2">the point I just want to make sure I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.090" end="00:17:12.460" style="s2">thinking about any implications I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.700" end="00:17:14.170" style="s2">thinking that Katie called in sick you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.460" end="00:17:16.060" style="s2">know something</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.170" end="00:17:23.050" style="s2">or less you remember something depending</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.060" end="00:17:26.820" style="s2">on the members relationship it could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.050" end="00:17:26.820" style="s2">are you feeling of knowing seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:31.920" style="s2">not the same thing as your confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.920" end="00:17:38.100" style="s2">the accuracy of what you have remembered</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.920" end="00:17:38.100" style="s2">okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">so here is what met caps arguments is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.899" end="00:17:50.169" style="s2">that this probe and the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:55.269" style="s2">knowing seems to be predictive of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.169" end="00:17:59.009" style="s2">successful memory search reliable</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.269" end="00:17:59.009" style="s2">predictor of successful memory sir</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:04.509" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.180" end="00:18:20.890" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s straight track your</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.640" end="00:18:23.080" style="s2">reasoning okay I&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.890" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">successfully predicts that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.080" end="00:18:28.180" style="s2">to have a successful memory search now</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:32.050" style="s2">why it&#39;s broken all the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.180" end="00:18:37.480" style="s2">that&#39;s all inside is a successful memory</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.050" end="00:18:42.490" style="s2">search so why is proven all about</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.480" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">basically saying inside is successful</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.490" end="00:18:46.360" style="s2">memory search after that and for</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:48.820" style="s2">successfully research and successful</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.360" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">memory search is predicted right by F</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.820" end="00:18:56.190" style="s2">okay you following the argument so far</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:19:02.230" style="s2">so what should a poke a be predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.190" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">is that so that&#39;s a straight prediction</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.230" end="00:19:09.250" style="s2">using the probe let&#39;s see if insight is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:12.490" style="s2">what Weisberg Inaba says just the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.250" end="00:19:15.730" style="s2">ability to you know complete a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.490" end="00:19:17.950" style="s2">successful memory search and feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:19.420" style="s2">knowing is predictive of that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.950" end="00:19:24.070" style="s2">feeling of knowing should be predictive</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.420" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">on inside so what she did right is she</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.070" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">gave people a standard memory card</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.770" style="s2">feeling of knowing for standard memory</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:37.030" style="s2">top and then feeling of knowing for</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.770" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">giving being given an insight problem so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.030" end="00:19:43.300" style="s2">you put people in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:44.620" style="s2">they&#39;re in the right they have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.300" end="00:19:47.160" style="s2">remember something they currently can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.620" end="00:19:50.230" style="s2">remember you get them to give they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.160" end="00:19:51.850" style="s2">given the memories rating and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.230" end="00:19:54.670" style="s2">see how predictive of that is of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.850" end="00:19:56.830" style="s2">successfully remembering looking into an</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.670" end="00:19:58.570" style="s2">insight problem solving situation that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.830" end="00:20:00.430" style="s2">they can&#39;t currently solve you can see</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.570" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">the structural parallels here and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.430" end="00:20:04.660" style="s2">you ask them a feeling of knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:05.210" style="s2">like will they scale and come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.660" end="00:20:10.039" style="s2">answer to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.210" end="00:20:15.020" style="s2">the answer now let&#39;s put you down</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.039" end="00:20:18.919" style="s2">yes you know an insect problem is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.020" end="00:20:21.710" style="s2">problem that requires right that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.919" end="00:20:24.909" style="s2">substance change the problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.710" end="00:20:27.140" style="s2">in order to solve the problem okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.909" end="00:20:30.590" style="s2">now part of what we&#39;re doing Duda is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.140" end="00:20:33.289" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to work out more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.590" end="00:20:35.270" style="s2">carefully what that is going to meet</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.289" end="00:20:37.880" style="s2">because one of my criticisms of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.270" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">is that the cultists have pockets talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.880" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">about is in relatively major now we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:44.690" style="s2">a couple of things we made progress on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:47.390" style="s2">that one I think necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.690" end="00:20:49.250" style="s2">sufficient namely one of the there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.390" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">things that an inside problems does for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.250" end="00:20:54.289" style="s2">you and they could be together lately</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">separate one more support things and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.289" end="00:20:58.730" style="s2">changes a combo disorderly explodes the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:02.870" style="s2">problem formulation into a non compos</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.730" end="00:21:05.450" style="s2">composition it might also be or it is or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:07.700" style="s2">in a particular might be changing an</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.450" end="00:21:13.820" style="s2">ill-defined problem into a 12-time</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.700" end="00:21:14.210" style="s2">problem okay all right so what did she</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.820" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.210" end="00:21:19.429" style="s2">well first of all she replicates the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:22.909" style="s2">cognitive probe she finds that there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.429" end="00:21:26.929" style="s2">a high high correspondence for memory so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.909" end="00:21:29.270" style="s2">people again feeling of knowing strongly</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.929" end="00:21:33.549" style="s2">predicts that people will successfully</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.270" end="00:21:33.549" style="s2">finding memory and needed information</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.730" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">the results of the insert columns was</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.140" end="00:21:42.399" style="s2">low in fact it was not statistically</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.399" style="s2">different from zero for insight columns</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.870" end="00:21:50.460" style="s2">now that&#39;s right that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.180" end="00:21:54.150" style="s2">powerful miss confirmation of why bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.460" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">it all with specific pieces that right</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.150" end="00:22:01.740" style="s2">inside problem-solving is just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:09.420" style="s2">successful memory search of course is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.740" end="00:22:13.050" style="s2">why this experiment said yes is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.050" end="00:22:17.160" style="s2">retrieval so feeling of knowing strong</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.780" end="00:22:19.050" style="s2">predictor that they will remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.160" end="00:22:20.340" style="s2">something that they can&#39;t currently they</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.340" end="00:22:24.540" style="s2">they will find it in memory and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.810" end="00:22:26.340" style="s2">really wide right now my house because</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.540" end="00:22:28.500" style="s2">Weisberg and although remember they</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.340" end="00:22:30.270" style="s2">proposed that all insight is the insight</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.500" end="00:22:33.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually exist insight is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.270" end="00:22:41.100" style="s2">as a memory search through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.180" end="00:22:43.980" style="s2">compartments well that&#39;s the implication</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.100" end="00:22:46.410" style="s2">of the conclusion is that now let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.980" end="00:22:47.790" style="s2">careful what madcap isn&#39;t saying she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.410" end="00:22:50.250" style="s2">not saying that memory search is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.790" end="00:22:52.920" style="s2">involved inside polar solvent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.250" end="00:22:54.990" style="s2">religious and that&#39;s not an implication</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.920" end="00:22:57.810" style="s2">experiment what she&#39;s saying is there</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.990" end="00:23:00.660" style="s2">must be something other than a memory</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.810" end="00:23:04.290" style="s2">search involved in inside promise or</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.660" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what you are there has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.290" end="00:23:08.850" style="s2">other process at work in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:11.690" style="s2">explain this very stark difference in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.850" end="00:23:11.690" style="s2">the results</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.160" end="00:23:20.260" style="s2">okay please remember that okay because</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.320" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">one standard mistake people make as soon</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.260" end="00:23:23.890" style="s2">as the date of the past is they will</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:25.570" style="s2">take this as and they will make the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.890" end="00:23:27.610" style="s2">claim that this show that memory</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.570" end="00:23:32.290" style="s2">searches not involved in insects that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.610" end="00:23:35.560" style="s2">not what it is showing picturing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.290" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">memory search why bring an ant all those</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.560" end="00:23:40.600" style="s2">alternatives is insufficient to explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:48.820" style="s2">what&#39;s going on into some other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.600" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">processing is that work yes yes yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.820" end="00:23:56.980" style="s2">god replicated in this experiment - I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:23:59.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what else is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.980" end="00:24:01.570" style="s2">good for day um I don&#39;t know I need you</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.770" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">to randomly by seeing it without what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.570" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">well like your political allegiances but</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:09.190" style="s2">the only theoretical motivation would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:11.350" style="s2">right now that I think that way under</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.190" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">the way the contract is described would</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.350" end="00:24:20.770" style="s2">be towards memory search knowing okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what she&#39;s relying on is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.770" end="00:24:25.240" style="s2">standard presentation so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:27.130" style="s2">already independently asserted and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.240" end="00:24:29.110" style="s2">particularly in the literature and she</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:31.000" style="s2">replicates that again in the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.110" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">position it&#39;s legitimate for her to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.000" end="00:24:33.130" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:34.810" style="s2">secondly is legitimate for her to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.130" end="00:24:38.820" style="s2">that way because that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.810" end="00:24:42.850" style="s2">proposal or wise for after what happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.820" end="00:24:44.500" style="s2">but your question is good you see how if</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.850" end="00:24:46.690" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know that theoretical debate</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.500" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">though you&#39;d be missing a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.690" end="00:24:50.920" style="s2">going on in this experiment you still</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:52.930" style="s2">get it in one sense but a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.920" end="00:24:56.800" style="s2">going on - sister with the other world</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.930" end="00:24:58.990" style="s2">would be getting then all right so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.800" end="00:25:02.860" style="s2">was really interesting I was really</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.990" end="00:25:05.230" style="s2">interested and like when this came up it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.860" end="00:25:07.390" style="s2">made a lot of noise as it should because</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.230" end="00:25:10.180" style="s2">it seems to be you know a stark contrast</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:18.810" style="s2">to the wise words in all but in one</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.180" end="00:25:18.810" style="s2">paper okay so Mike have followed this up</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">am I not shocked there</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.430" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">so this is down Metcalfe 1986 BFF ever a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.220" end="00:25:36.680" style="s2">little world is right next kappa gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:43.800" style="s2">put a people side up</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.680" end="00:25:46.350" style="s2">okay so Metcalfe was interested in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.800" end="00:25:50.220" style="s2">that feeling of knowing is very much</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.350" end="00:25:53.430" style="s2">like a snapshot it&#39;s a end of them it</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.220" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">sort of the is a one-shot sort of take</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.430" end="00:25:57.930" style="s2">on what&#39;s going on in cognition so if</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:25:59.580" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me to use a metaphor she</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.930" end="00:26:03.110" style="s2">wanted to try and replace that snapshot</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.580" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">with a film she wanted a more online</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.110" end="00:26:07.800" style="s2">moment-to-moment at least every 10</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:11.310" style="s2">second measure of what&#39;s going on so she</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.800" end="00:26:14.610" style="s2">wanted to turn the probe from one shot</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.310" end="00:26:18.090" style="s2">probe into an into a continuous probe is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.610" end="00:26:21.860" style="s2">that right because she was trying to she</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.090" end="00:26:24.630" style="s2">wanted to determine like how is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.860" end="00:26:26.310" style="s2">metacognitive you know where is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.630" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">interacting with problem solving it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.310" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">obviously not a simple predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:36.120" style="s2">simple differences okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">so again what she did she waited to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.120" end="00:26:40.560" style="s2">search inference framework to try and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:43.350" style="s2">see if she could come up what from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.560" end="00:26:45.750" style="s2">search inference framework a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.350" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">motivation for a contract that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.750" end="00:26:50.100" style="s2">allow her to do what she wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:52.350" style="s2">and so what she&#39;s doing is she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.100" end="00:26:56.720" style="s2">basically going to replace feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.350" end="00:26:56.720" style="s2">knowing with a feeling of warmth</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.900" end="00:27:04.850" style="s2">okay so she took a look at the work and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:06.500" style="s2">we already done this so I can remind you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:09.890" style="s2">she took that there were local workers</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.500" end="00:27:13.340" style="s2">of the work Simon from the GPS and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.890" end="00:27:15.320" style="s2">general problem solver and then Simon</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.340" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">and we talked a bit about this last time</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.320" end="00:27:22.520" style="s2">admitted that the median heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:24.230" style="s2">requires write something that is telling</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.520" end="00:27:31.910" style="s2">you you&#39;re getting closer or farther</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.230" end="00:27:35.870" style="s2">away from your goal and he this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.910" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">direct quote from where he go to many</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.870" end="00:27:41.809" style="s2">that examination of path produces clues</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">of the warmer colder variety and of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.809" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">course what he&#39;s alluding to there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.220" end="00:27:49.570" style="s2">the game&#39;s warmer colder which it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:52.010" style="s2">there to be how and while at the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.570" end="00:27:53.900" style="s2">flat you know it&#39;s like to put much</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.010" end="00:27:56.090" style="s2">beefier people drive you people move</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.900" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">around you say one more gold or what</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.090" end="00:27:59.179" style="s2">we&#39;re older and then they actually get</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:02.570" style="s2">to the object because they followed your</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.179" end="00:28:10.220" style="s2">war record instructors yeah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.570" end="00:28:13.880" style="s2">anyways um what the cache theorized then</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.220" end="00:28:18.440" style="s2">is that people as they&#39;re attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.880" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">solve problems right are constantly by</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.440" end="00:28:22.760" style="s2">not just a one-shot feeling of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:25.160" style="s2">their class is doing a feeling of warmth</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.760" end="00:28:30.440" style="s2">by getting closer or farther away closer</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.160" end="00:28:32.120" style="s2">or farther away from a goal so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.440" end="00:28:34.840" style="s2">this was varied again various on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.120" end="00:28:37.340" style="s2">house part she wants to reformulate this</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.840" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">and she&#39;s in critical dialogue with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.340" end="00:28:40.220" style="s2">surgeon constrain work she hasn&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:42.410" style="s2">brought out of thin air she was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.220" end="00:28:44.330" style="s2">search inference framework at health in</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.410" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">order to generate the new theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.330" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">construct she&#39;s playing weally weally</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">matrix Lee I think by the rule is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">really clearly really well</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">so what she then decided to do right to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.500" end="00:29:12.010" style="s2">use this more ongoing processing probe</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:14.500" style="s2">while people were solving problems so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.010" end="00:29:16.510" style="s2">what she did is she gave the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:19.000" style="s2">participants were all attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.510" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">solve purported insect problems these</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.000" end="00:29:22.060" style="s2">are problems that had generally been</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:24.520" style="s2">called inside pops now we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.060" end="00:29:26.650" style="s2">come back to that Jesus has already</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.520" end="00:29:29.590" style="s2">brought out that there&#39;s a problematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.650" end="00:29:30.970" style="s2">notion I want to foreshadow that is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.590" end="00:29:34.650" style="s2">really cated that something has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.970" end="00:29:36.250" style="s2">critically on its own an insect problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.650" end="00:29:38.530" style="s2">because that&#39;s something we should</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.250" end="00:29:40.270" style="s2">reflect on we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.530" end="00:29:42.160" style="s2">that point the literature catches up</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.270" end="00:29:44.050" style="s2">sorry we&#39;re speaking from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.160" end="00:29:46.330" style="s2">omniscience of hindsight the literature</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.050" end="00:29:47.770" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t catch up with that and realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.330" end="00:29:49.300" style="s2">that that&#39;s an important issue the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.770" end="00:29:51.910" style="s2">person is actually is going to raise</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.300" end="00:29:54.850" style="s2">that question if it keeps coming back is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.910" end="00:29:56.440" style="s2">Weisberg okay so we&#39;re going to follow</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.850" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">that the beta so right now I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.440" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">you that&#39;s a legitimate concern put it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:04.270" style="s2">on hold because we&#39;re working towards it</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:07.270" style="s2">again because we&#39;re only building 86</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.270" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">letting you even reform them okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.270" end="00:30:13.990" style="s2">so what that cap does is give people</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.580" style="s2">purported insight problems to solve and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.990" end="00:30:17.650" style="s2">then they have to provide a lump rating</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.580" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">every 10 seconds it has to provide</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.650" end="00:30:20.770" style="s2">warmth rating everything in sight now</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:24.450" style="s2">remember what I said this is the second</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.770" end="00:30:24.450" style="s2">experiment and it won&#39;t be satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.920" end="00:30:36.929" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.580" end="00:30:38.789" style="s2">there were two finding okay and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.929" end="00:30:40.350" style="s2">know and be careful because they sound</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.789" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">like the contradictory they&#39;re not what</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.350" end="00:30:43.830" style="s2">contradicts they&#39;re not contradicting</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:46.200" style="s2">with give me Chancellor you want up</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.830" end="00:30:48.179" style="s2">first of all the first finding is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.200" end="00:30:52.369" style="s2">there&#39;s enough rough increase in warmth</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.179" end="00:30:55.860" style="s2">ratings right before a solution is down</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.369" end="00:30:58.139" style="s2">so if you&#39;re looking at the ratings they</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.860" end="00:31:00.649" style="s2">look like this and then boom just before</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.139" end="00:31:00.649" style="s2">the insider</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.970" end="00:31:14.190" style="s2">second right strong a strong feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:17.970" style="s2">war predicted failure to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.190" end="00:31:20.639" style="s2">problem rather than success so although</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.970" end="00:31:23.369" style="s2">you get this right before solution right</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.639" end="00:31:26.759" style="s2">a strong feeling of warm actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.369" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">predicted failure to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.759" end="00:31:33.659" style="s2">rather than success now what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:38.249" style="s2">remember is to distinguish rate from</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.659" end="00:31:40.980" style="s2">difference this is a sudden rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.249" end="00:31:43.739" style="s2">setting here&#39;s what we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:45.239" style="s2">be you know it is compatible with an</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.739" end="00:31:48.239" style="s2">illogical different it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.239" end="00:31:50.549" style="s2">graphically sudden right which might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.239" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">different from just an overall high</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.549" end="00:31:56.809" style="s2">feeling the warmth rating right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:56.809" style="s2">like this recommend beginning</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.830" end="00:32:02.879" style="s2">don&#39;t confuse rate with difference those</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.749" end="00:32:05.989" style="s2">two those two findings are not in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.879" end="00:32:05.989" style="s2">contradiction to each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.060" end="00:32:18.340" style="s2">in fact the rate issue seems to be more</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:23.020" style="s2">predictive than the overall amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.340" end="00:32:25.420" style="s2">warmth so make up said that this was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.020" end="00:32:30.280" style="s2">confused rule of defect let&#39;s go along</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.420" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">here this is confusing right so what she</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.280" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">argued is in these situations where</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:44.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a very strong feeling of warmth</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:49.660" style="s2">overall but does it predict success she</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.560" end="00:32:51.400" style="s2">speculated the people are satisfied okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.660" end="00:32:52.810" style="s2">so this is a good opportunity to teach a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.400" end="00:32:57.310" style="s2">concept we&#39;re going to need a divorce as</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.810" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">well that satisficing okay this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.310" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">notion drawn from again the old insider</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.170" end="00:33:09.310" style="s2">Jose what do you do with in satisficing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.610" end="00:33:17.770" style="s2">satisficing is you&#39;ll take a let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.310" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">you want to reach a goal right but</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.770" end="00:33:25.540" style="s2">getting to that goal is very hard for</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:30.190" style="s2">difficult what you do is start slicing</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.540" end="00:33:32.620" style="s2">is you sell or goal that somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.190" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">similar to the actual goal that you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.620" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">it but that is easier to get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.010" end="00:33:49.610" style="s2">that satisficing satisficing is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.620" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">don&#39;t you to go for this school that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.610" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">really hard so you we can you go to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:00.280" style="s2">what you needed to do and then you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:03.260" style="s2">satisfied with that lesser goal and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.280" end="00:34:06.760" style="s2">you&#39;ll probably realize that this you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.260" end="00:34:06.760" style="s2">can explain a lot of your days behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.929" end="00:34:16.610" style="s2">yes like the strong feeling of warmth</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.840" end="00:34:17.720" style="s2">all the way through to be formulating</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.610" end="00:34:20.030" style="s2">the problem wrong from the very</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.720" end="00:34:21.620" style="s2">beginning and our thinking was doing it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.030" end="00:34:24.770" style="s2">right that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.620" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">oppressing Oh Deb it look exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.770" end="00:34:28.550" style="s2">they&#39;re doing they have made a step but</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.950" style="s2">the problem is with the chromatin inside</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.550" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">problem is there&#39;s no specific answer so</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.950" end="00:34:34.820" style="s2">if you formulate it this way and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:35.960" style="s2">move towards that you think oh I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.820" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">to get there I&#39;m going to get there and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.960" end="00:34:38.389" style="s2">then you don&#39;t actually get there but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.460" end="00:34:39.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not just people that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.389" end="00:34:40.880" style="s2">consciously saying okay I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.980" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.880" end="00:34:45.889" style="s2">I&#39;ll move towards this solution right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:46.940" style="s2">now some of them might be some of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.889" end="00:34:50.870" style="s2">might be doing what you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.940" end="00:34:53.090" style="s2">the point is for her argument it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.870" end="00:34:55.310" style="s2">really matter because what she what she</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.090" end="00:34:57.770" style="s2">did was is is a compound here namely</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.310" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">that she has not controlled how people</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.770" end="00:35:04.270" style="s2">are approaching these problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:04.270" style="s2">she hasn&#39;t control for that variable</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.580" end="00:35:13.930" style="s2">yes under people who incident for cancer</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.730" end="00:35:15.490" style="s2">they would with our eyes for this simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.930" end="00:35:18.250" style="s2">cause you mean across different problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.490" end="00:35:20.140" style="s2">not among so they would start off free</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.250" end="00:35:22.360" style="s2">high and then you realize that they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.140" end="00:35:23.860" style="s2">also may be sure to make this pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.360" end="00:35:25.240" style="s2">picture and drive it so they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.860" end="00:35:27.910" style="s2">there cuz then they go down like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.240" end="00:35:29.380" style="s2">and then I was like that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.910" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if she reports that</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.380" end="00:35:33.820" style="s2">specifically or separately</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">hello ma John Belushi does why did you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.820" end="00:35:39.430" style="s2">ask like um for us intriguing respondent</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:43.720" style="s2">maybe people would like come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.430" end="00:35:47.770" style="s2">today that despite there being of one</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.720" end="00:35:51.460" style="s2">today are actually prevent in my life</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.770" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">recorded today actually encoded before</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.460" end="00:35:57.460" style="s2">just before you that&#39;s good yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:59.410" style="s2">honestly don&#39;t remember I haven&#39;t looked</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.460" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">at the original the primary data in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.410" end="00:36:03.730" style="s2">long time so it might be something to I</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.930" end="00:36:22.930" style="s2">don&#39;t believe it&#39;s in the discussion or</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.730" end="00:36:25.000" style="s2">the problem sure it might be I guess in</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.930" end="00:36:27.580" style="s2">fact it&#39;s sort of an a priori argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:32.020" style="s2">there that always that probably might</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.580" end="00:36:33.670" style="s2">have some initial like high and I it if</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.020" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">the question is about its duration and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.670" end="00:36:39.730" style="s2">its impact select the question I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:41.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question they should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.730" end="00:36:43.230" style="s2">actually I think empirically</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.350" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">investigated even using this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.230" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">design program yes over the level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:53.030" style="s2">like one that recorded</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">so they think they know the answer then</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.030" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">they&#39;ll get warm if we don&#39;t it looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:37:00.230" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right right now so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:01.700" style="s2">think what he was suggesting what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.230" end="00:37:04.250" style="s2">name cute cute</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.700" end="00:37:05.690" style="s2">anybody is suggesting it like in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.250" end="00:37:07.400" style="s2">of insight problems people initially</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.690" end="00:37:09.530" style="s2">think they know the answer then they</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.400" end="00:37:11.180" style="s2">realize they don&#39;t and then if they saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.530" end="00:37:13.610" style="s2">that they get this like a dish is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.180" end="00:37:15.890" style="s2">correct yes is that a general also</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.610" end="00:37:18.500" style="s2">important thing not so much bad example</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.890" end="00:37:20.840" style="s2">of more so like uh like good to depend</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.500" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">more solid subject because I felt they</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.840" end="00:37:23.570" style="s2">whether like the subject believe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">they&#39;re knowledgeable that depending</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.570" end="00:37:34.070" style="s2">would would determine - oh crap I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:35.990" style="s2">quite see I mean because these people I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.070" end="00:37:38.030" style="s2">mean this is not tracked until it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.990" end="00:37:39.980" style="s2">definitely shocked at like whether that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.030" end="00:37:42.290" style="s2">is right right it&#39;s like if that makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.980" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">me translate their belief that answers</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.290" end="00:37:46.580" style="s2">right right they feel so depending on</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.630" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the subject under hangers right</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.580" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">whether it&#39;s read a lot that would show</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:52.730" style="s2">the crap more so than actual like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:55.370" style="s2">accuracy abash sure but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.730" end="00:37:58.130" style="s2">these don&#39;t this graph doesn&#39;t reduce</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:38:01.340" style="s2">excessiveness does okay so that one</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.130" end="00:38:04.760" style="s2">actually does protect like a lot of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.340" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">okay so so if it was just what you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.760" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">saying there wouldn&#39;t be a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:10.220" style="s2">the success of the two right</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:13.460" style="s2">but what she wanted to know is why why</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.220" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">like they turn it around not to twist</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.460" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">your words or anything but both of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:17.960" style="s2">are sort of getting strong ratings</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:19.550" style="s2">towards the end why are these people</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.960" end="00:38:22.010" style="s2">largely an actor these people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.550" end="00:38:24.140" style="s2">largely active so what she&#39;s speculating</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.010" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">is that because these people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.140" end="00:38:28.820" style="s2">satisficing this is bec second it that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:30.110" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re misrepresenting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.820" end="00:38:35.690" style="s2">problems of the stuff they&#39;re miss</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.110" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">formulating the problem okay great good</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.690" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">this is true today so you get a whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:42.440" style="s2">debate mixed up with experimental</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.530" end="00:38:44.630" style="s2">competition you have not this stuff okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.440" end="00:38:47.240" style="s2">so what was needed was what we got to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.630" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">is try to control for and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.240" end="00:38:49.640" style="s2">the experiment is called</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.140" style="s2">theoretical debater gonna keep hammering</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.640" end="00:38:52.789" style="s2">each other right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.140" end="00:38:55.299" style="s2">it&#39;s like what we got to do is control</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.789" end="00:38:58.099" style="s2">for this so that people will treat right</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.299" end="00:39:01.249" style="s2">some problems as inside problems and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.099" end="00:39:03.140" style="s2">only there&#39;s a problem okay now again</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.249" end="00:39:06.829" style="s2">that goes back to Jesus question about</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.140" end="00:39:10.130" style="s2">well but what is good inside is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.829" end="00:39:12.589" style="s2">objectively this now madcap sort of does</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.130" end="00:39:14.269" style="s2">what people often do which is legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.589" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">for a while is she sort of did an</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.269" end="00:39:19.400" style="s2">experimental hack around about</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:21.019" style="s2">theoretical problem and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.400" end="00:39:23.630" style="s2">cool that she did it because it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.019" end="00:39:27.079" style="s2">needed to be done it was an eidetic he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.630" end="00:39:31.489" style="s2">getting picked up what you do what she</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.079" end="00:39:40.999" style="s2">did was she win the third experiment so</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.489" end="00:39:44.599" style="s2">this is Metcalfe and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.999" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s pronounced we be wide I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.599" end="00:39:54.769" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard it 1987 I mean I know a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:55.940" style="s2">lot of we you know a lot of like it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.769" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">written this way that&#39;s good for now</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.940" end="00:40:04.819" style="s2">sweet let&#39;s go with weed then we have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:09.319" style="s2">nice pocket very moderate so so what she</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.819" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">did was to find she got inside problems</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.319" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">and then she got naughty like problems</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:18.829" style="s2">she had people trying to solve both and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:22.249" style="s2">it gives even the warmth ratings for</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.829" end="00:40:28.039" style="s2">both so she&#39;s trying to pull these two</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.249" end="00:40:29.779" style="s2">apart how did she pick up nan inside</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.039" end="00:40:32.239" style="s2">problems what she did was she found</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.779" end="00:40:35.779" style="s2">well-defined problems that has been</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.239" end="00:40:39.589" style="s2">analyzed and modeled by programs using</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.779" end="00:40:41.719" style="s2">the means interest she went in and said</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.589" end="00:40:45.949" style="s2">well what kind of problems doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.719" end="00:40:47.269" style="s2">heuristic doing well at again she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.949" end="00:40:49.459" style="s2">using the search inference framework</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.269" end="00:40:50.920" style="s2">itself so these are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.459" end="00:40:53.890" style="s2">problems that the meet them too</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.920" end="00:40:58.089" style="s2">well Act I&#39;m going to use them as my</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.890" end="00:40:59.859" style="s2">model or actually you&#39;re nodding that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.089" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">correct she sort of there&#39;s an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.859" end="00:41:05.650" style="s2">that is good is it not too theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:07.990" style="s2">exploitation all right okay so she goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.650" end="00:41:09.099" style="s2">in and she says basically we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.990" end="00:41:11.260" style="s2">is you&#39;re going to have this problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.099" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">that operation was not inside problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.260" end="00:41:13.930" style="s2">we&#39;re going to find the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:15.940" style="s2">have traditionally been I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.930" end="00:41:17.319" style="s2">tell people like to solve them and give</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.940" end="00:41:20.470" style="s2">feeling of one training and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.319" end="00:41:22.390" style="s2">going to compare these two okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.470" end="00:41:24.069" style="s2">know control group pulling a particle</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.390" end="00:41:27.460" style="s2">pound you know this is how you do good</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.069" end="00:41:29.799" style="s2">good son and like I say this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.460" end="00:41:32.020" style="s2">experimental hot the intuition is clear</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.799" end="00:41:34.510" style="s2">you understand why it makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.020" end="00:41:35.829" style="s2">it&#39;s fair because she&#39;s painting the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.510" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2">ocean from the searching for spring</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.829" end="00:41:39.579" style="s2">result so she&#39;s not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:42.760" style="s2">pulling their to thin air but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.579" end="00:41:46.540" style="s2">ultimately she has not answered his</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.760" end="00:41:47.950" style="s2">question as to yes but what is an insect</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.540" end="00:41:49.390" style="s2">problem and and are off are there</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.950" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">problems that are intrinsically in their</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.390" end="00:41:52.650" style="s2">homes okay another keep carrying on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:54.700" style="s2">point because I&#39;ve made it clear that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.650" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be addressed that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.700" end="00:42:01.260" style="s2">important okay all right so what where</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2">are the predictions due to predictions</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.260" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2">so let&#39;s just get clear on the names</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.069" end="00:42:11.069" style="s2">talkable</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.430" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">okay so this is an incremental curve it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.440" end="00:42:24.829" style="s2">goes up incremental e alright and just</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.910" end="00:42:24.829" style="s2">gonna brush curve is that Alright</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.460" end="00:42:33.059" style="s2">working for that so the first prediction</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.650" end="00:42:36.329" style="s2">was an incremental versus an abrupt warm</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.059" end="00:42:38.670" style="s2">pattern or it&#39;s not in sight versus</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.329" end="00:42:43.049" style="s2">insect so the idea this is what people</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.670" end="00:42:46.740" style="s2">would get for not in sight and this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.049" end="00:42:53.880" style="s2">what people would give for himself plus</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.740" end="00:42:56.220" style="s2">you second prediction you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.880" end="00:42:59.490" style="s2">accurate metacognition for non insight</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.220" end="00:43:01.769" style="s2">problems whereas you would not have that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.490" end="00:43:03.390" style="s2">for inside problems so now she&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.769" end="00:43:08.069" style="s2">back and trying to gather what was also</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:13.230" style="s2">to the first 86 then okay so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.069" end="00:43:17.759" style="s2">this is going it&#39;s right this is going</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.230" end="00:43:18.869" style="s2">to be accurate and inaccurate this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.759" end="00:43:20.309" style="s2">not the same thing as whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.869" end="00:43:22.140" style="s2">people fault the problem like in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.309" end="00:43:23.519" style="s2">second experiment this is accurate about</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.140" end="00:43:25.099" style="s2">people&#39;s predictions about probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.519" end="00:43:29.460" style="s2">going to do okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.099" end="00:43:34.230" style="s2">all right so take a look at this does</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.460" end="00:43:35.970" style="s2">this make sense okay so basically what</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.230" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">she&#39;s saying is feeling the warmth and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.970" end="00:43:42.390" style="s2">feeling of knowing ultimately work for</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:46.039" style="s2">non insight problems because they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.390" end="00:43:48.359" style="s2">probably mostly standard memory search</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.039" end="00:43:49.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to work for inside</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.359" end="00:43:52.589" style="s2">problems and you&#39;ve got to get this</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.890" end="00:43:54.660" style="s2">sudden abrupt change it&#39;s likely because</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.589" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">something other than the end of memory</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.660" end="00:43:59.730" style="s2">search is going on and both of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:03.980" style="s2">predictions were welcome to go through</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.730" end="00:44:10.070" style="s2">those predictions were welcome drew yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.980" end="00:44:10.070" style="s2">they ever done people to have like</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.190" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">depends different inside problems have</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.800" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">different so happy cheerful ribbit I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.110" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk is a different</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:31.560" style="s2">property the problem in general is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.110" end="00:44:34.080" style="s2">what happens in the slight variation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.560" end="00:44:37.110" style="s2">our ability to a permanent solution to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.080" end="00:44:38.820" style="s2">problem okay and there&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.110" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">answer to that and it has Khalil of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.820" end="00:44:42.210" style="s2">politics that problems and memory are</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:43.710" style="s2">interacting because obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.210" end="00:44:46.020" style="s2">relationship between the insider memory</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.710" end="00:44:48.020" style="s2">is not critical pets they for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.020" end="00:44:51.480" style="s2">relationship so there&#39;s an answer coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.020" end="00:44:54.570" style="s2">okay yes um why do you do all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.480" end="00:44:57.210" style="s2">accurate accurate for uh accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.570" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">inaccurate yeah this is there is only</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.210" end="00:45:04.080" style="s2">need to predict that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:07.620" style="s2">solve the problem forces this all right</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.080" end="00:45:08.940" style="s2">so now the first thing happens well the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.620" end="00:45:12.360" style="s2">first thing you want to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.940" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">replication and as you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.360" end="00:45:15.750" style="s2">a lot about this program only time and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2">we didn&#39;t do it very much which is why</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.750" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">psychology is going to a replication</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.700" end="00:45:21.660" style="s2">presence right but this is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:24.600" style="s2">things for which they work with</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.660" end="00:45:27.300" style="s2">replication and it was replication and</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.490" end="00:45:35.580" style="s2">insight accurate for like English moment</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.900" end="00:45:37.380" style="s2">where you are you have people along the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.580" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">way when most of their predictions</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.380" end="00:45:40.530" style="s2">they&#39;ll say I&#39;m not going to another</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.570" style="s2">dose or naka de oversold I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.530" end="00:45:44.340" style="s2">available solar you ask people here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.570" end="00:45:46.380" style="s2">really able solar so you get a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.340" end="00:45:48.810" style="s2">accurate predictions than you do here</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.380" end="00:45:51.150" style="s2">wait but it&#39;s not inaccurate they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.810" end="00:45:53.940" style="s2">wrong about being able to solve it no no</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.150" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">no a so-called if they saw the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.940" end="00:45:58.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll be something on is it this is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:00.750" style="s2">yeah these are not Arabs or so like</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.740" end="00:46:02.790" style="s2">right now this is not the same graphs as</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.750" end="00:46:04.350" style="s2">in the second experiment she&#39;s pulling</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.790" end="00:46:08.220" style="s2">the two things of particle Connors</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.350" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">sorry for that okay so let&#39;s get back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.220" end="00:46:15.660" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:18.989" style="s2">all right yes these drastic tears my</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.660" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">hearing is connect I made a</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.989" end="00:46:23.279" style="s2">metacognitive critical phases right not</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:26.069" style="s2">firing</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.279" end="00:46:28.170" style="s2">really so there&#39;s also the metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.069" end="00:46:30.299" style="s2">port way to solve this problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.170" end="00:46:31.529" style="s2">you&#39;re also given your giving raises but</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.299" end="00:46:36.450" style="s2">you&#39;re also actually going to solve this</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.529" end="00:46:39.150" style="s2">problem so here&#39;s a plausible thing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.450" end="00:46:41.729" style="s2">when is like this there&#39;s a thing leave</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.150" end="00:46:43.109" style="s2">you that can easily extrapolate that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.729" end="00:46:47.789" style="s2">you&#39;re probably going to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.109" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">solution thinking of you where as there</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.789" end="00:47:01.019" style="s2">isn&#39;t such a thing here okay yes yes so</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:06.029" style="s2">in an insight problem you&#39;re feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.019" end="00:47:07.970" style="s2">warmth doesn&#39;t work until only until the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.029" end="00:47:11.489" style="s2">very end</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.970" end="00:47:13.859" style="s2">but because when it suddenly goes up</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.489" end="00:47:15.269" style="s2">here people start to say why I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.859" end="00:47:18.329" style="s2">to solve this and they can have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.269" end="00:47:20.430" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not like they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.329" end="00:47:22.799" style="s2">have a feeling of warmth beginning thank</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.430" end="00:47:24.900" style="s2">you very well very minimal yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.799" end="00:47:28.859" style="s2">insight home doesn&#39;t induce that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.900" end="00:47:32.700" style="s2">of I have this in my brain that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.859" end="00:47:34.859" style="s2">yeah okay until then until done that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.700" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">exactly what the graph is showing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.859" end="00:47:40.499" style="s2">that just a clarification okay resolving</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:42.839" style="s2">annoyance a problem to resolve your math</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.499" end="00:47:44.219" style="s2">however more critical in Maxwell we like</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.839" end="00:47:45.749" style="s2">going to the troops in your hand and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.219" end="00:47:47.999" style="s2">like okay so I like three quarks going</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.749" end="00:47:50.670" style="s2">through the steps that you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.999" end="00:47:52.740" style="s2">has a short where is I probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.670" end="00:47:55.630" style="s2">know I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.740" end="00:47:57.130" style="s2">that&#39;s right but we want to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.630" end="00:47:58.090" style="s2">want to get beyond what you did concern</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.130" end="00:48:00.550" style="s2">up for your question</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.090" end="00:48:02.970" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want you the are there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.550" end="00:48:06.370" style="s2">what happens is inserts the Dartmouth</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.970" end="00:48:08.470" style="s2">okay so I noticed again</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.370" end="00:48:10.090" style="s2">that&#39;s bound up with Jesus question</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.470" end="00:48:12.250" style="s2">about well what we actually mean when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.090" end="00:48:14.230" style="s2">tell them something is critical and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.250" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">again we&#39;re working toward that because</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.230" end="00:48:17.830" style="s2">we&#39;re doing theoretical debate external</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:19.900" style="s2">competition right it&#39;s going to take us</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.830" end="00:48:24.100" style="s2">like seven lectures to get close to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.900" end="00:48:27.610" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in them and it should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.100" end="00:48:29.850" style="s2">hard because if the argument so far</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.610" end="00:48:31.990" style="s2">right top the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.850" end="00:48:35.260" style="s2">restructuring and problem formulation is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.990" end="00:48:43.270" style="s2">being like manipulated is the core of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.260" end="00:48:46.270" style="s2">your problem solving the problem it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.270" end="00:48:48.190" style="s2">happens right well that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.270" end="00:48:51.220" style="s2">we&#39;re saying when we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.190" end="00:48:53.770" style="s2">independent way of talking about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.220" end="00:48:55.900" style="s2">not quite circular in that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.770" end="00:48:59.260" style="s2">saying is there is something that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.900" end="00:49:02.740" style="s2">call inside problem that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.260" end="00:49:04.420" style="s2">processed differently than I&#39;m a regular</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.740" end="00:49:06.550" style="s2">problems and now I want to show you the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.420" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">recognition is a reputation as to that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.550" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">sensitive okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.590" end="00:49:15.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.520" end="00:49:16.770" style="s2">talked about this we already talked</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.750" end="00:49:18.990" style="s2">about it in the discretion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.770" end="00:49:21.180" style="s2">arabic-english confidence this is all</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.990" end="00:49:22.830" style="s2">you know this is a universal pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.180" end="00:49:24.650" style="s2">term that really isn&#39;t well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.830" end="00:49:28.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s a bluff this is very subjective</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.650" end="00:49:30.030" style="s2">okay so the thing is we people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.320" end="00:49:31.650" style="s2">reporting something but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.030" end="00:49:33.450" style="s2">reflect any kind of difference in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.650" end="00:49:34.950" style="s2">processing well again it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.450" end="00:49:37.830" style="s2">the machinery back then to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.950" end="00:49:45.600" style="s2">very very carefully but what happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.830" end="00:49:49.410" style="s2">was public interesting studies the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.600" end="00:49:55.800" style="s2">axle-back did this in 1989 versions of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.410" end="00:50:03.780" style="s2">this 1994 desolate I don&#39;t know clean</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.800" end="00:50:08.460" style="s2">absolute rice I don&#39;t know these these</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.780" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">witches other than this work 1995 so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.460" end="00:50:14.280" style="s2">these are the three studies and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:18.420" style="s2">they want what they did was they they</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.280" end="00:50:20.070" style="s2">set up the same experiment right we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.420" end="00:50:22.980" style="s2">people solving not inside problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.070" end="00:50:24.510" style="s2">inside problems you have people giving</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.980" end="00:50:27.770" style="s2">the feeling of more frames but then they</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.510" end="00:50:33.960" style="s2">were also check measuring heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.770" end="00:50:35.640" style="s2">heart rate because typically heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.960" end="00:50:37.260" style="s2">actually reflects you know metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.640" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">differences in processing etcetera</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.260" end="00:50:42.300" style="s2">etcetera</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:44.910" style="s2">- other things but you look well you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.300" end="00:50:47.070" style="s2">going to look for some tightly the heart</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.910" end="00:50:49.890" style="s2">ring for example is tracking the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.070" end="00:50:52.560" style="s2">the wall is it the heart rate is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.890" end="00:50:54.660" style="s2">actually reflecting is - you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.560" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">concordance means right the two graphs</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.660" end="00:50:57.270" style="s2">that I would have put them one on top of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:50:59.820" style="s2">the other they would have closely</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.270" end="00:51:01.380" style="s2">superpose yeah if I have high</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.820" end="00:51:02.910" style="s2">concordance that means the heart rate is</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.380" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">actually measuring there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.910" end="00:51:09.480" style="s2">actually physiological going on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.060" end="00:51:11.750" style="s2">corresponds to feeling of what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.480" end="00:51:16.070" style="s2">what they found</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.750" end="00:51:17.900" style="s2">a down those two things they found for</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.070" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">the audience I promise heart rate went</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.900" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">like this and for the inside Papa&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:24.050" style="s2">went like that and then they also found</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.580" style="s2">that these heart bearings grafts had</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.050" end="00:51:28.210" style="s2">hiked accordance with the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.580" end="00:51:28.210" style="s2">warmth grafts</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.520" end="00:51:35.690" style="s2">so result they replicated in three</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.170" end="00:51:39.410" style="s2">studies Metcalfe&#39;s original experiment</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.690" end="00:51:41.300" style="s2">which is good and then secondly in three</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.410" end="00:51:44.590" style="s2">study they were able to show that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.300" end="00:51:48.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something objective going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.590" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">with doing the warm there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.560" end="00:51:53.840" style="s2">processing occurring in solving sets is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">it&#39;s showing-up and you know highly</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.840" end="00:52:02.119" style="s2">concordance physiological and okay so</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.560" end="00:52:05.240" style="s2">that impressed people all the sets of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.119" end="00:52:07.099" style="s2">things are like something&#39;s going on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.240" end="00:52:08.660" style="s2">wise work and all the claim that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.099" end="00:52:13.490" style="s2">nothing going on inside it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.660" end="00:52:16.130" style="s2">becoming impossible not not been going</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.490" end="00:52:17.960" style="s2">on it&#39;s not standard their research is</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.130" end="00:52:20.030" style="s2">even making a physiological difference</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.960" end="00:52:23.060" style="s2">the ceiling of work difference is real</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.030" end="00:52:25.099" style="s2">and so objective set so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.060" end="00:52:27.260" style="s2">difference what&#39;s going on we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.099" end="00:52:33.650" style="s2">say there&#39;s nothing different or special</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.260" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">about the inside okay we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.650" end="00:52:40.150" style="s2">take a look now another set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:44.030" style="s2">experiments and once again I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.150" end="00:52:45.800" style="s2">as we go through the experiment we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.030" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">look at it but I&#39;m also going to point</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.800" end="00:52:53.660" style="s2">out a looming theoretical flaw in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:57.859" style="s2">experiment just like the issue about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.660" end="00:53:00.950" style="s2">objectivity of an insight problem is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.859" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">looming issue by the way although this</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.950" end="00:53:05.960" style="s2">has been brought up on a related issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:08.570" style="s2">which was the result of an employer is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.960" end="00:53:10.580" style="s2">whether or not the class of things the</p>

<p begin="00:53:17.569" end="00:53:25.369" style="s2">do with right the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.759" end="00:53:27.140" style="s2">insight and verbal overshadow now here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.369" end="00:53:29.450" style="s2">my theoretical forewarning and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.140" end="00:53:31.219" style="s2">going to come back to this some of you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.450" end="00:53:32.839" style="s2">know this from 250 because I do this</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.219" end="00:53:35.450" style="s2">argument more extensively in public</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.839" end="00:53:37.459" style="s2">activity even though this term shows</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.459" end="00:53:44.930" style="s2">I think verbal overshadowing is a</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.930" end="00:53:50.450" style="s2">to come back and I think very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.209" end="00:53:52.369" style="s2">criticize the constructs nevertheless I</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.450" end="00:53:57.130" style="s2">want to look through the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.369" end="00:53:59.779" style="s2">because they show important things ok so</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.130" end="00:54:02.059" style="s2">the experiments are going to rely a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.779" end="00:54:04.219" style="s2">in terms of on this notion of verbal</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.059" end="00:54:06.700" style="s2">overshadowing I&#39;m going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.219" end="00:54:08.299" style="s2">later and say that the notion that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.700" end="00:54:09.739" style="s2">overshadowing is done by something</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.299" end="00:54:12.739" style="s2">verbal I&#39;ll show you on the way way</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.739" end="00:54:16.279" style="s2">that&#39;s misleading language itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.739" end="00:54:17.390" style="s2">an interference effect right and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.279" end="00:54:19.160" style="s2">the notion of overshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.390" end="00:54:20.989" style="s2">implies the model of attention that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.160" end="00:54:22.670" style="s2">overly simplistic and does not capture</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.670" end="00:54:28.279" style="s2">on and ends up all you need to do right</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.779" end="00:54:29.509" style="s2">now is just put opinion verbal over</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.279" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">shouting reveille he&#39;s going to come</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.509" end="00:55:30.299" style="s2">they were making is in that cast</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.460" end="00:55:35.249" style="s2">difference between people solving inside</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.730" end="00:56:43.079" style="s2">and they did a series of studies and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">what they found was that concurrent</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.079" end="00:56:49.800" style="s2">verbalization markedly impairs insight</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:51.869" style="s2">on solving it really impairs inside</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.690" end="00:57:05.160" style="s2">ization had no effect on not instead</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.070" end="00:57:08.030" style="s2">focus on so you seem to get a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.160" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">difference on interference between</p>

<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:16.980" style="s2">inside problems are you getting very</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.329" end="00:57:20.609" style="s2">little perspiration now two things come</p>

<p begin="00:57:20.609" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">in this exciting one right you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:27.390" style="s2">think about the sort of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.010" end="00:57:32.040" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible or nothing they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.390" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">something in Platteville is that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.040" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">know insight is largely an ineffable</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">process and therefore speaking might</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.170" style="s2">somehow interfere with inside because if</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:41.880" style="s2">I ask you how you have an insight you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.170" end="00:57:45.240" style="s2">go well I didn&#39;t have an insight and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.880" end="00:57:47.910" style="s2">then I did that will be your explanation</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.240" end="00:57:54.510" style="s2">right and we can come back to this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.910" end="00:57:55.859" style="s2">leading in it so now that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.510" end="00:57:57.180" style="s2">that sort of the level they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.859" end="00:57:59.069" style="s2">about it but there there might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.180" end="00:58:00.930" style="s2">something else going on and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.069" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">again to foreshadow what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.930" end="00:58:05.819" style="s2">talk about later that lines up with what</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">we talked about when we criticize right</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.819" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">wipers are always on and us to criticize</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:17.430" style="s2">them which is the idea that insight may</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:20.690" style="s2">be much more of a procedural process and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.430" end="00:58:23.910" style="s2">a propositional process it not not be</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.690" end="00:58:26.670" style="s2">verbalization versus the ability it</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.910" end="00:58:30.380" style="s2">might be that insight is a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.670" end="00:58:35.570" style="s2">procedural process that can be interfere</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.380" end="00:58:37.910" style="s2">by propositional process in fact one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.570" end="00:58:40.550" style="s2">the best ways to interrupt people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.910" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">procedural abilities is to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.550" end="00:58:45.650" style="s2">go into propositional process so if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.050" style="s2">experiments are video martial arts a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.650" end="00:58:49.490" style="s2">good thing to do is to say wow that was</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.490" end="00:58:53.780" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll try to answer you and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.290" end="00:58:55.370" style="s2">then they fall apart they can&#39;t spar or</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.780" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">if I were to ask you to tell me what</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.380" end="00:59:25.490" style="s2">much as it&#39;s just a verbal overshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.630" end="00:59:29.110" style="s2">there might be something going on there</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.490" end="00:59:33.530" style="s2">another way is me putting this to you is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.110" end="00:59:35.030" style="s2">is it languages per se that&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.530" end="00:59:38.030" style="s2">the interference which is what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.030" end="00:59:40.250" style="s2">asserting or is it that certain types of</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.289" end="01:00:14.399" style="s2">right okay that&#39;s all I need you to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.929" end="01:00:16.469" style="s2">right now okay okay all right so there</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.399" end="01:00:17.999" style="s2">is something going on here they</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.469" end="01:00:19.889" style="s2">interpreted in terms of verbal or</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.529" end="01:00:25.499" style="s2">of processing we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.999" end="01:00:29.819" style="s2">later okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.499" end="01:00:31.469" style="s2">so sure and Melcher 1995 they have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.819" end="01:00:33.719" style="s2">have all these protocol analyses like</p>

<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:23.670" style="s2">is lots of inferential strategies here</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.380" end="01:01:23.670" style="s2">not very many here</p>

<p begin="01:03:35.400" end="01:03:40.320" style="s2">means of them is that okay now sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.130" end="01:03:44.609" style="s2">right I&#39;ve been rained out too since I</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.320" end="01:03:47.400" style="s2">was black glasses a long time I can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.280" end="01:03:57.090" style="s2">got some eyes so classes and I are but</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.560" end="01:04:00.300" style="s2">sometimes what I have to do right is</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.090" end="01:04:01.740" style="s2">right I do this right now that my</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.300" end="01:04:03.690" style="s2">glasses are transparent I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.740" end="01:04:08.010" style="s2">through them sometimes I step back and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.690" end="01:04:10.410" style="s2">adjust my attentional focus which in</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.010" end="01:04:13.380" style="s2">this case is also perceptual focus like</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.410" end="01:04:15.000" style="s2">a visual focus on you I adjust my focus</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.380" end="01:04:19.170" style="s2">on looking at my glasses rather than</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.000" end="01:04:21.090" style="s2">looking through that means that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.170" end="01:04:23.640" style="s2">looking through them I&#39;m stepping back</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.090" end="01:04:25.170" style="s2">and looking at them and is there almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.640" end="01:04:27.619" style="s2">allows me to pay attention to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.170" end="01:04:31.400" style="s2">actually going on in the media right</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.619" end="01:04:33.630" style="s2">like to do things like clean my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.400" end="01:04:34.830" style="s2">and then of course when I put it back on</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.630" end="01:04:37.950" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.830" end="01:04:39.420" style="s2">I can see differently to them before so</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.950" end="01:04:41.160" style="s2">what I&#39;m suggesting to you is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.420" end="01:04:42.930" style="s2">what&#39;s happening people are engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.160" end="01:04:44.609" style="s2">something like a core process of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.930" end="01:04:46.740" style="s2">mindfulness they&#39;re stepping back and</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.609" end="01:04:48.540" style="s2">looking at the cognitive medium let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.740" end="01:04:50.340" style="s2">a lot in their mind rather than looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.540" end="01:04:53.369" style="s2">through those processes directly at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.340" end="01:04:54.930" style="s2">problem yes how do they know that things</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.369" end="01:04:58.800" style="s2">happen all right</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.930" end="01:05:00.150" style="s2">how do they know that they are doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.800" end="01:05:02.460" style="s2">this because they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.150" end="01:05:04.020" style="s2">metacognitive reports they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.460" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in their mind rather</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.020" end="01:05:10.910" style="s2">than talking about properties or</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:13.880" style="s2">features of the problem yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.910" end="01:05:18.339" style="s2">so the experiment involves a prop right</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.880" end="01:05:21.380" style="s2">and then as a matter of feedback to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.339" end="01:05:23.960" style="s2">the Proctor the only prompt is tell me</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.380" end="01:05:26.030" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing I&#39;m beginning to so</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.960" end="01:05:28.580" style="s2">there&#39;s an initial talk and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.030" end="01:05:30.200" style="s2">just let run and then what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.580" end="01:05:32.839" style="s2">is they&#39;re looking through all of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.200" end="01:05:35.270" style="s2">protocols this is everything that people</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.839" end="01:05:37.400" style="s2">have said and looking for what was</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.270" end="01:05:40.130" style="s2">President did wanted absolutely oh so</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.400" end="01:05:41.570" style="s2">the first difference and first of all we</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.130" end="01:05:43.190" style="s2">haven&#39;t even determine if it&#39;s predicted</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.570" end="01:05:45.190" style="s2">or not what people are saying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.190" end="01:05:49.700" style="s2">doing what they&#39;re doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.190" end="01:05:50.900" style="s2">okay the first prima facia what we see</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.700" end="01:05:53.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.900" end="01:05:57.380" style="s2">differential process ain&#39;t going on and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.690" end="01:05:59.720" style="s2">the not ESA problems and there seems to</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.380" end="01:06:02.599" style="s2">be this transparency opacity ship is</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.720" end="01:06:05.420" style="s2">kind of metacognitive directing of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.599" end="01:06:09.490" style="s2">attention at the cognitive medium rather</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.420" end="01:06:09.490" style="s2">than through it in inside problems a</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.210" end="01:06:16.970" style="s2">plausible like at least initially</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.640" end="01:06:18.740" style="s2">plausible speculation which will they</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.970" end="01:06:21.530" style="s2">have to try and turn into theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.740" end="01:06:23.240" style="s2">argument and empirical evidence is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.530" end="01:06:24.589" style="s2">people are stepping back and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.240" end="01:06:26.359" style="s2">look at how they&#39;re formulating the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.589" end="01:06:30.920" style="s2">problem rather than looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.359" end="01:06:32.270" style="s2">formulation to formulated problems in</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.920" end="01:06:33.950" style="s2">terms the final look at the problem</p>

<p begin="01:06:33.950" end="01:06:41.480" style="s2">problem rather than at the formulated</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.830" end="01:06:43.849" style="s2">problems okay so as I&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.480" end="01:06:46.250" style="s2">before what people say they&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.849" end="01:06:47.990" style="s2">what they are doing and right are not</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.250" end="01:06:50.060" style="s2">the same thing this is like intersection</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.990" end="01:06:51.890" style="s2">as inside as the main way of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.060" end="01:06:53.900" style="s2">do psychology right before the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.890" end="01:06:57.290" style="s2">behaviorist because infrastructure is</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.900" end="01:06:59.330" style="s2">shitty sorry scrappy intersection does</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.290" end="01:07:00.500" style="s2">not work well because what people think</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.330" end="01:07:03.980" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.500" end="01:07:06.980" style="s2">doing is can be very different this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.980" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">by the way why you should always you</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.980" end="01:07:12.349" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t ignore it but you should</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">always question any evidence that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.349" end="01:07:17.059" style="s2">real preferred then that&#39;s produced by</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.059" end="01:07:22.159" style="s2">because while you&#39;re getting access to</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.339" end="01:07:25.909" style="s2">do is people&#39;s introspectively available</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.159" end="01:07:27.859" style="s2">information which can be completely</p>

<p begin="01:07:32.319" end="01:07:40.579" style="s2">yes what you mean by other types of</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.579" end="01:07:46.699" style="s2">generally more accurate than others</p>

<p begin="01:13:00.210" end="01:13:09.660" style="s2">problem 38 it has not been the case that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.960" end="01:13:12.270" style="s2">as we have produced machines that get</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.330" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">always you&#39;re doing is speeding it up</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.770" end="01:14:21.239" style="s2">and inside then there should be a</p>

<p begin="01:14:34.750" end="01:14:41.440" style="s2">so what they did is they looked for when</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.050" end="01:14:43.630" style="s2">people were solving these problems right</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.440" end="01:14:46.630" style="s2">and they&#39;re using the inferential</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.630" end="01:14:50.110" style="s2">their success on the non inside problems</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.550" end="01:14:51.640" style="s2">crawled into their success on the intent</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.110" end="01:14:53.320" style="s2">of what&#39;s the degree of the correlation</p>

<p begin="01:15:02.580" end="01:15:11.220" style="s2">so it&#39;s both an implausible thesis and</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.170" end="01:15:22.300" style="s2">so the question then emerges what kinds</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.360" end="01:15:24.730" style="s2">of processes if interracial processes</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.300" end="01:15:33.490" style="s2">are not predictive of intercom solving</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.730" end="01:15:36.120" style="s2">what kind of processes are so suppose to</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.490" end="01:15:36.120" style="s2">work all right</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.250" end="01:16:04.380" style="s2">and culture in 1993 they used what they</p>

<p begin="01:16:07.460" end="01:16:19.590" style="s2">methodology so let&#39;s talk about process</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.960" end="01:16:22.320" style="s2">a and skill means I&#39;m sort of always</p>

<p begin="01:16:42.540" end="01:16:46.320" style="s2">we can do is you can see in process a</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.190" end="01:16:50.219" style="s2">the decision goes like this in process a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.320" end="01:16:54.500" style="s2">is involved is a causal factor in skill</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.219" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">B then performance on tasks involving a</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.500" end="01:17:01.200" style="s2">performance on tasks involving a should</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:03.330" style="s2">be predictive of tasks requiring skill B</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.200" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">so you&#39;re trying to figure out what are</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.330" end="01:17:09.210" style="s2">the processes out work in this and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:12.300" style="s2">say well I think this process is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.210" end="01:17:15.510" style="s2">working this is that&#39;s the case and</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.300" end="01:17:18.300" style="s2">performance on that should be predictive</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.510" end="01:17:25.460" style="s2">of how well you do with this does</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:25.460" style="s2">everybody understand everything okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.790" end="01:17:33.810" style="s2">so what they wanted to do was what they</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.590" end="01:17:34.950" style="s2">did was give a bank of tests and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.810" end="01:17:36.420" style="s2">going to see people that are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.950" end="01:17:40.140" style="s2">completely using the individual</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.420" end="01:17:42.320" style="s2">differences methodology they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.140" end="01:17:45.390" style="s2">give a bank of tests to see which</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.320" end="01:17:48.930" style="s2">processes are predictive in</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.390" end="01:17:52.110" style="s2">problem-solving and attempt to try and</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.930" end="01:17:54.270" style="s2">get clearer about what are the elements</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.110" end="01:17:56.730" style="s2">within what are the component processes</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.270" end="01:17:58.770" style="s2">we need enter false promises</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.730" end="01:18:00.810" style="s2">so another way of putting that is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.770" end="01:18:03.210" style="s2">individual difference methodology is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.810" end="01:18:07.850" style="s2">way and method of trying to analyze a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.210" end="01:18:10.680" style="s2">process down into more basic processes</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.850" end="01:18:13.830" style="s2">going to analyze the skill I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.680" end="01:18:16.620" style="s2">that word because the potential that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.830" end="01:18:21.180" style="s2">insight is procedural in nature into its</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.620" end="01:18:23.070" style="s2">its component skills okay so they</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.180" end="01:18:26.190" style="s2">consider three potential insight</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.070" end="01:18:27.780" style="s2">processes restructuring I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.190" end="01:18:31.370" style="s2">how the operation lines in for even a</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.780" end="01:18:34.980" style="s2">minute field independence and</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.370" end="01:18:38.760" style="s2">unconscious search okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.980" end="01:18:40.170" style="s2">so yield independence is when when</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.760" end="01:18:42.090" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a different bending task</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.170" end="01:18:43.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying what the hell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.090" end="01:18:45.900" style="s2">talking about how many of you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.800" end="01:18:47.700" style="s2">played as a kid or you have younger</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.900" end="01:18:51.810" style="s2">children in your lives who have to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.700" end="01:18:52.890" style="s2">Where&#39;s Waldo how many of you know at</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.810" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">least what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.890" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">I thought it over</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.200" end="01:19:03.410" style="s2">why is it why is it hard to find Waldo I</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.850" end="01:19:05.500" style="s2">guess there&#39;s a like this is not a fun</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.410" end="01:19:07.190" style="s2">look wide open time you&#39;re out Waldo</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.500" end="01:19:12.010" style="s2">there&#39;s Waldo</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.190" end="01:19:12.010" style="s2">okay why is it hard to find Waldo</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.940" end="01:19:19.100" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of other people right</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.100" end="01:19:20.690" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.100" end="01:19:22.340" style="s2">things around Waldo that seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.690" end="01:19:23.990" style="s2">some of all those features but not all</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.340" end="01:19:25.970" style="s2">of all those features so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.990" end="01:19:27.350" style="s2">potentially extracted so it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.970" end="01:19:30.080" style="s2">what you have to do and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.350" end="01:19:36.980" style="s2">learn how to write in to do something so</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.080" end="01:19:41.450" style="s2">that Waldo&#39;s stand out last one is</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.980" end="01:19:43.370" style="s2">unconscious search and that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.450" end="01:19:45.070" style="s2">that somehow you&#39;re connecting things</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.370" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">that are not directly connected</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.070" end="01:19:53.620" style="s2">unconsciously alright so how did they</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:53.620" style="s2">how if they operationalize this yes</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.970" end="01:20:02.590" style="s2">restructuring restructuring field</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.530" end="01:20:02.590" style="s2">independence and uncontested welcome yes</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.040" end="01:20:09.980" style="s2">when you&#39;re when system when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.510" end="01:20:13.310" style="s2">trying to find Waldo you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.980" end="01:20:16.040" style="s2">field independent task you try to make</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.310" end="01:20:17.900" style="s2">Waldo independent from his field you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.040" end="01:20:20.690" style="s2">trying to say there&#39;s Waldo I can see</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.900" end="01:20:26.060" style="s2">him right he&#39;s no longer embedded in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.690" end="01:20:27.770" style="s2">field like people and distractors I was</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.060" end="01:20:30.290" style="s2">just using it because it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.770" end="01:20:32.720" style="s2">common version another field independent</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.290" end="01:20:36.170" style="s2">that&#39;s it we decided to make a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.720" end="01:20:37.640" style="s2">thing one of the things that binds us</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.170" end="01:20:40.310" style="s2">together is a culture things like a</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.640" end="01:20:42.090" style="s2">Waldo and Star Wars</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.310" end="01:20:45.030" style="s2">what we stand for</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.090" end="01:20:47.100" style="s2">okay okay so they tested restructure</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.030" end="01:20:49.110" style="s2">this is really clever they tested</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.100" end="01:20:53.490" style="s2">restructuring by giving people</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.110" end="01:20:55.320" style="s2">out-of-focus pictures so I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.490" end="01:20:56.850" style="s2">an out-of-focus picture and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.320" end="01:20:59.220" style="s2">do even doing even better versions of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.850" end="01:21:01.170" style="s2">that now but I gave you how to photos</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.220" end="01:21:02.760" style="s2">out of focus picture and you do</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.170" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">something it&#39;s really cool people will</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.760" end="01:21:08.310" style="s2">do this well I look at it and I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:10.230" style="s2">oh that different I&#39;m like oh okay now</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.310" end="01:21:11.760" style="s2">you probably know that you can now do</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.230" end="01:21:14.910" style="s2">that you can do this even better because</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:16.500" style="s2">of this baller services you can do like</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.910" end="01:21:19.050" style="s2">really course pixelation of a picture</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.500" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">and then you sort of look at it neither</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.050" end="01:21:24.690" style="s2">and then you can sort of do this thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.480" end="01:21:32.370" style="s2">in your head and you go oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.690" end="01:21:33.870" style="s2">actually la okay now there&#39;s ones that</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.370" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">seem to combine them that are really</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.870" end="01:21:39.210" style="s2">cool right</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:41.880" style="s2">so you look at a picture that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.210" end="01:21:43.620" style="s2">bunch of colored splotches purple with</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.880" end="01:21:45.450" style="s2">red and all pencils and you stare at it</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.620" end="01:21:47.610" style="s2">for a while and all of a sudden it goes</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.450" end="01:21:48.870" style="s2">3d and it&#39;s a 3d picture before that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.610" end="01:21:52.200" style="s2">jumping out of the ocean how many of</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.870" end="01:21:55.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve done those I&#39;m an easy okay I</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.200" end="01:21:58.470" style="s2">mean you&#39;ve done those and you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.320" end="01:22:02.760" style="s2">it to work okay so we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.470" end="01:22:03.900" style="s2">to take you away okay so the interest</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.760" end="01:22:05.010" style="s2">thing about when it works and when it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.900" end="01:22:06.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and what&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.010" end="01:22:13.680" style="s2">predictable about I&#39;m not predictable</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.690" end="01:22:16.950" style="s2">okay all right so how did they do the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.680" end="01:22:19.230" style="s2">field just embedding they just gave</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.950" end="01:22:21.590" style="s2">people things variations on like where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.230" end="01:22:21.590" style="s2">Walter</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.930" end="01:22:27.600" style="s2">so they need to be vetted figures test</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.260" end="01:22:29.760" style="s2">you have all these lines and yes sir oh</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.600" end="01:22:35.160" style="s2">can you see the three-dimensional square</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.760" end="01:22:38.670" style="s2">oh there it is yeah you can see three</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.160" end="01:23:00.360" style="s2">things for the unconscious search they</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.670" end="01:23:02.640" style="s2">did a remote associate tax so a word</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.360" end="01:23:04.760" style="s2">that all three of those are associated</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.640" end="01:23:04.760" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.680" end="01:23:20.750" style="s2">like old blackboard like oh so then</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.920" end="01:23:25.010" style="s2">those are called remote the associate</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.750" end="01:23:26.110" style="s2">tax return has a wonderful acronym a rat</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.010" end="01:23:28.640" style="s2">cat</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.110" end="01:23:30.170" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s games are on the market</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.640" end="01:23:31.580" style="s2">now that you can actually play this game</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.170" end="01:23:33.410" style="s2">called tripods where you have to do this</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.580" end="01:23:34.720" style="s2">given three things you have to say what</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.410" end="01:23:45.110" style="s2">do they all have in common</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.720" end="01:23:47.150" style="s2">okay then there&#39;s now interestingly how</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.110" end="01:23:48.290" style="s2">this has got picked up into the general</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.150" end="01:23:51.140" style="s2">literature these are a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.290" end="01:23:53.240" style="s2">confused we&#39;ll come back to them then</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.140" end="01:23:55.790" style="s2">this category instance generation so</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.240" end="01:23:58.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a category okay so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.790" end="01:24:00.080" style="s2">category the category of gems the first</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.310" end="01:24:02.690" style="s2">one is diamond quickly give me two other</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.080" end="01:24:04.520" style="s2">category numbers gems</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.690" end="01:24:06.020" style="s2">the first one is diamond give me two</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.520" end="01:24:09.430" style="s2">more shots on out come on</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.020" end="01:24:11.660" style="s2">there&#39;s emeralds rubies sapphires okay</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.430" end="01:24:13.310" style="s2">those are going to go to the people the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.660" end="01:24:14.660" style="s2">ones the coffers are the ones that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.310" end="01:24:16.430" style="s2">should buy for your significant other</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.660" end="01:24:22.870" style="s2">but they don&#39;t come up very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.430" end="01:24:22.870" style="s2">don&#39;t buy that good here aside towpath</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.250" end="01:24:31.340" style="s2">good and then the last one which I and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.480" end="01:24:33.680" style="s2">think other people argue is to be thrown</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.340" end="01:24:36.110" style="s2">out if it&#39;s terrifically confounded with</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.680" end="01:24:37.670" style="s2">anagrams they&#39;re using this as an</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.110" end="01:24:38.960" style="s2">unconscious search and Graham is when</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.670" end="01:24:41.870" style="s2">you have a word that&#39;s mixed up and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.960" end="01:24:43.580" style="s2">have to reorganize it that seems to be a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.870" end="01:24:45.530" style="s2">mixture of all kinds of these other</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.580" end="01:24:46.850" style="s2">tasks it seems to be confounded it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.530" end="01:24:49.310" style="s2">just a memory search right after</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.850" end="01:24:50.840" style="s2">restructure if you feel this is bedding</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.310" end="01:24:53.720" style="s2">you&#39;re doing possibly some remote</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.840" end="01:24:57.640" style="s2">associate so the an investor&#39;s be thrown</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.720" end="01:24:57.640" style="s2">out there is compiled identity</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.980" end="01:25:05.330" style="s2">all right so now what we have is we have</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.160" end="01:25:07.430" style="s2">a bunch of things yes each to name the</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.330" end="01:25:09.830" style="s2">name of the second topic is a category</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.430" end="01:25:17.780" style="s2">instance generation you have to generate</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.830" end="01:25:20.390" style="s2">instances from a category all right</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.780" end="01:25:23.290" style="s2">so yes all adults are under</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.390" end="01:25:23.290" style="s2">unconsciously</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:36.590" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s get going</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.370" end="01:25:39.020" style="s2">so perceptual restructuring turned out</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.590" end="01:25:42.290" style="s2">to be the single best predictor of</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.020" end="01:25:44.090" style="s2">insight performance the better people</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.290" end="01:25:47.530" style="s2">are on perceptual restructuring the</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.090" end="01:25:50.180" style="s2">better they are at some insight problems</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.530" end="01:25:51.770" style="s2">now whether or not as perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.180" end="01:25:54.620" style="s2">restructuring is probably a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.770" end="01:25:57.020" style="s2">shake because a lot of problems can be</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.620" end="01:25:58.790" style="s2">posed viewed an abstract form and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.020" end="01:26:00.680" style="s2">can still solve them so it might be</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.790" end="01:26:06.620" style="s2">attentional restructuring the rapture</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.680" end="01:26:10.820" style="s2">talking about maybe measuring something</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.620" end="01:26:13.700" style="s2">more basic like cognitive flexibility so</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.820" end="01:26:16.310" style="s2">don&#39;t lean too much on a perceptual part</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.700" end="01:26:20.090" style="s2">of that of this but what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.310" end="01:26:21.800" style="s2">is that this is your ability to do this</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.090" end="01:26:28.520" style="s2">is a very good predictor of how you live</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.800" end="01:26:31.130" style="s2">inside problems we&#39;re going to need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.520" end="01:26:34.280" style="s2">do that weird attentional thing where</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.130" end="01:26:36.640" style="s2">you redistribute what salient was</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.280" end="01:26:40.489" style="s2">foreground what&#39;s background all that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.640" end="01:26:42.650" style="s2">seems to be predictive Club regret</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.489" end="01:26:45.260" style="s2">evidence to suggest predictive of your</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.650" end="01:26:48.470" style="s2">ascetical second best is yield</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.260" end="01:26:51.320" style="s2">independence test be able to find Waldo</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.470" end="01:26:55.000" style="s2">really well is actually predictive of</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.320" end="01:26:55.000" style="s2">how good you are in solving suppose</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.510" end="01:27:03.400" style="s2">now it&#39;s not clear that that puzzle in</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.000" end="01:27:05.680" style="s2">the center you get you prove well all</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.400" end="01:27:08.500" style="s2">day long you&#39;ll get better at solving</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.680" end="01:27:12.900" style="s2">inside problems something like that has</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.500" end="01:27:15.940" style="s2">cleared now remote associate tasks were</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.900" end="01:27:19.510" style="s2">predictive of insight but much less and</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.940" end="01:27:21.730" style="s2">fielding dependence and restructuring</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.510" end="01:27:26.400" style="s2">now here&#39;s why I wanted to stop apply</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.730" end="01:27:29.320" style="s2">this or a set that does predict insight</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.400" end="01:27:31.900" style="s2">clearly that&#39;s what be able to show but</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.320" end="01:27:36.330" style="s2">it&#39;s much it&#39;s much much weaker</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.900" end="01:27:40.960" style="s2">predictor can feel this embedding or</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.330" end="01:27:43.360" style="s2">perceptual restructuring now why is for</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:48.040" style="s2">making going on about this because many</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.360" end="01:27:52.810" style="s2">researchers use this as the task for</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.040" end="01:27:54.850" style="s2">insight console which is somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.810" end="01:27:57.370" style="s2">problematic why are they using this one</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.850" end="01:28:01.270" style="s2">when the other two are more predictive</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.370" end="01:28:06.250" style="s2">of insight problem-solving is probably</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.270" end="01:28:08.680" style="s2">easier okay so and that&#39;s that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.250" end="01:28:11.500" style="s2">thing right ease of experimental design</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.680" end="01:28:14.290" style="s2">is a real thing in science so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.500" end="01:28:16.630" style="s2">I&#39;m not ridiculing you understand what</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.290" end="01:28:19.180" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is setting in a reminder for</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.630" end="01:28:25.930" style="s2">you when you leave this that this is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.180" end="01:28:27.850" style="s2">best okay not theoretically the best it</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.930" end="01:28:30.220" style="s2">may be better the logically easier to</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.850" end="01:28:32.640" style="s2">use but that doesn&#39;t mean it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.220" end="01:28:36.940" style="s2">necessarily getting clearly app</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.640" end="01:28:42.480" style="s2">essential functions of inside okay just</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.940" end="01:28:44.890" style="s2">remember that okay category generation</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:48.450" style="s2">records of not throw out anagram</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.890" end="01:28:50.720" style="s2">category generation was not was not</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.450" end="01:28:54.690" style="s2">predictable inside</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.720" end="01:28:56.400" style="s2">again you need to confirm that searching</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.690" end="01:28:58.560" style="s2">through the compartments is not the</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.400" end="01:29:00.390" style="s2">primary thing you do in order to solve</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.560" end="01:29:03.420" style="s2">an inside problem so yeah another</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.390" end="01:29:05.280" style="s2">replication sorry an empirical dis</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.420" end="01:29:07.250" style="s2">confirmation of the Weisberg and all the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.280" end="01:29:09.960" style="s2">theories of how you recycle</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.250" end="01:29:13.850" style="s2">okay so category generation searching</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.960" end="01:29:16.260" style="s2">the category box does not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.850" end="01:29:19.590" style="s2">now with interesting is it goes the</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.260" end="01:29:24.180" style="s2">other way the perceptual restructuring</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.590" end="01:29:26.640" style="s2">and embedded figures tests are not</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.180" end="01:29:28.710" style="s2">predictive of non inside problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.640" end="01:29:30.870" style="s2">your ability to do perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.710" end="01:29:33.480" style="s2">restructuring your ability to find Waldo</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.870" end="01:29:36.710" style="s2">is not predictive of how well you will</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.480" end="01:29:36.710" style="s2">solve non inside problems</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.900" end="01:29:48.239" style="s2">category generation as well as other</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.710" end="01:29:51.239" style="s2">international processing measures such</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.239" end="01:29:54.449" style="s2">as m80 scores which do not predict the</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.239" end="01:29:56.880" style="s2">insight do predict success on on inside</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.449" end="01:29:59.580" style="s2">problems but which are basically getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.880" end="01:30:01.770" style="s2">is processes that predict success on</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.580" end="01:30:03.900" style="s2">insight do not predict success on on</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.770" end="01:30:06.060" style="s2">insight and vice-versa</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.900" end="01:30:11.820" style="s2">you&#39;re getting something close to adult</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.060" end="01:30:13.440" style="s2">association okay which is pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.820" end="01:30:14.630" style="s2">evidence it&#39;s not conclusive but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.440" end="01:30:18.360" style="s2">pretty good evidence if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.630" end="01:30:21.239" style="s2">different processes at work in factually</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.360" end="01:30:23.429" style="s2">ruptured come to a conclusion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.239" end="01:30:26.699" style="s2">almost as strong as last version</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.429" end="01:30:28.349" style="s2">although and it&#39;s amazing how these two</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.699" end="01:30:30.719" style="s2">click through the direct opposite but it</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.349" end="01:30:33.449" style="s2">was this is what they say the two types</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.719" end="01:30:35.489" style="s2">of processes draw unfolded the two types</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.449" end="01:30:39.030" style="s2">of problems drawn qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.489" end="01:30:39.960" style="s2">different processes and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.030" end="01:30:42.750" style="s2">argue later I think theoretically</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.960" end="01:30:44.310" style="s2">they&#39;ve got the wrong way around</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.750" end="01:30:46.020" style="s2">but nevertheless you understand what</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.310" end="01:30:48.330" style="s2">they&#39;re saying that the processing</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.020" end="01:30:49.530" style="s2">that&#39;s going on inside or inside problem</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.330" end="01:30:50.580" style="s2">should be very different to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.530" end="01:30:56.010" style="s2">processing going about acknowledging</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.580" end="01:30:57.119" style="s2">said problems but anybody other way</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.010" end="01:31:00.420" style="s2">around is I think we have different</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.119" end="01:31:02.849" style="s2">problem solving processes and when we do</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.420" end="01:31:06.180" style="s2">one we call the insight or we use the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.849" end="01:31:09.369" style="s2">other we call the audience</p>

<p begin="01:31:20.239" end="01:31:23.350" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.980" end="01:31:31.950" style="s2">so we&#39;ll come back to again the issue of</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.400" end="01:31:34.170" style="s2">verbal overshadowing when we come back</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.950" end="01:31:36.030" style="s2">if you get to look at some wise words</p>

<p begin="01:32:46.830" end="01:32:51.240" style="s2">up on this thing we talked about briefly</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.150" end="01:32:53.130" style="s2">before its scent of leaping in an in</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.240" end="01:32:57.440" style="s2">psychology I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.130" end="01:32:57.440" style="s2">know what happened in between a saying</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.640" end="01:33:04.770" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting is this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.380" end="01:33:07.020" style="s2">the metaphor I was leaping metaphor that</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.770" end="01:33:08.790" style="s2">is trying to metaphorically integrate</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.020" end="01:33:12.300" style="s2">the search the search infants framework</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.790" end="01:33:14.190" style="s2">and the perceptual network because</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.300" end="01:33:15.060" style="s2">you&#39;re moving through a space but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.190" end="01:33:18.210" style="s2">left the ground</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.060" end="01:33:20.940" style="s2">so you&#39;re break so it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.210" end="01:33:22.620" style="s2">combine like leave visualization because</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.940" end="01:33:24.930" style="s2">you do in one place and suddenly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.620" end="01:33:28.080" style="s2">in the other put it with that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.930" end="01:33:32.829" style="s2">moved through space what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.080" end="01:33:36.170" style="s2">to pick up on is this gap in processing</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.829" end="01:33:37.849" style="s2">now interesting enough the researchers</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.170" end="01:33:40.999" style="s2">are going to try and operationalize that</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.849" end="01:33:45.199" style="s2">and to theorize as to what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.999" end="01:33:48.440" style="s2">that gap and to propose some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.199" end="01:33:51.170" style="s2">beginning of an alternative to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.440" end="01:33:52.489" style="s2">computational framework we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.170" end="01:33:57.440" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.489" end="01:34:07.190" style="s2">it&#39;s beginning so this work was done by</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.440" end="01:34:08.570" style="s2">our agreement computer if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.190" end="01:34:12.889" style="s2">next I&#39;m going to do the review so we</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.570" end="01:34:27.559" style="s2">show you later set by now think is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.889" end="01:34:29.809" style="s2">a baker and CP 1996 so they want they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.559" end="01:34:31.849" style="s2">going to use an individual differences</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.809" end="01:34:34.789" style="s2">methodology to study what they call</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.849" end="01:34:36.380" style="s2">inductively thing now because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.789" end="01:34:39.349" style="s2">conduction to be an inferential process</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.380" end="01:34:40.730" style="s2">I think that the word they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.349" end="01:34:43.190" style="s2">there&#39;s incorrect I shouldn&#39;t be calling</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.730" end="01:34:45.619" style="s2">a conductive weeping because of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.190" end="01:34:49.519" style="s2">whole point of what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.619" end="01:34:51.619" style="s2">progress so I&#39;m going to recommend to</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.519" end="01:34:54.079" style="s2">avoid confusion especially those who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.619" end="01:34:57.170" style="s2">used and some working on logic as what</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.079" end="01:34:59.059" style="s2">what induction and deduction are etc I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.170" end="01:35:00.650" style="s2">literally sake recommend it we call that</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.059" end="01:35:03.519" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about cognitive leaping</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.650" end="01:35:03.519" style="s2">rather than conducting</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.110" end="01:35:13.590" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s talk about how they</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.670" end="01:35:15.420" style="s2">operationalized leaving and then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.590" end="01:35:18.540" style="s2">the theory behind it was concealed</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.420" end="01:35:22.440" style="s2">ethical argumentation behind us so what</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.540" end="01:35:25.949" style="s2">they did was they need people a series</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.440" end="01:35:28.370" style="s2">of cues oh sorry with the senator</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.949" end="01:35:31.590" style="s2">protocol to bring to show you this is a</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.370" end="01:35:33.659" style="s2">direct visual imagery well are you sure</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.590" end="01:35:35.639" style="s2">usually itself it just goes to some a</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.659" end="01:35:37.739" style="s2">bunch of dots on the screen to look at</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.639" end="01:35:39.480" style="s2">you go like this and then I&#39;ll fill the</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.739" end="01:35:40.949" style="s2">more dots we place it on the little bit</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.480" end="01:35:43.980" style="s2">and then more dots and it&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.949" end="01:35:48.710" style="s2">will hold that to soap up understand a</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.980" end="01:35:52.949" style="s2">tactic so what I can do is I can write I</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.710" end="01:35:56.070" style="s2">can try right every 10 seconds or so</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.949" end="01:36:00.679" style="s2">more dots are added and your instruction</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.070" end="01:36:03.179" style="s2">is the following try to use pure cues</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.679" end="01:36:04.920" style="s2">before we&#39;re playing it or try as soon</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.179" end="01:36:07.920" style="s2">as you can to tell me what this is going</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.920" end="01:36:10.020" style="s2">to be a picture of the other tip will</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.920" end="01:36:15.000" style="s2">fit with word stems but the pictures are</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.020" end="01:36:17.850" style="s2">I think less confounded does everybody</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.000" end="01:36:22.440" style="s2">understand a pack now a good cognitively</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.850" end="01:36:26.159" style="s2">/ is somebody who is uses fewer cues but</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.440" end="01:36:28.710" style="s2">will largely get the answer by the way</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.159" end="01:36:32.070" style="s2">on your test put cognitively / if the</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.710" end="01:36:34.020" style="s2">question comes up it&#39;s funny the first</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.070" end="01:36:36.710" style="s2">time but by the fourth or fifth time</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.020" end="01:36:39.989" style="s2">reading about cognitive lepers and</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.710" end="01:36:45.320" style="s2">they&#39;re not funny here the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.989" end="01:36:45.320" style="s2">distressing okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.940" end="01:36:52.130" style="s2">all right so here&#39;s the proposal people</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.580" end="01:36:58.790" style="s2">who are better at being cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.130" end="01:37:01.700" style="s2">leapers we can use fewer cues but yet</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.790" end="01:37:06.500" style="s2">accurately come to the right answer will</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.700" end="01:37:08.480" style="s2">be better at insect problem stories so</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.500" end="01:37:10.730" style="s2">first of all before we go on they</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.480" end="01:37:13.250" style="s2">received goodies leave receive good</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.730" end="01:37:14.989" style="s2">external confirmation for that but there</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.250" end="01:37:25.580" style="s2">you are anything the better you are at</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.989" end="01:37:29.450" style="s2">office all okay so let&#39;s look let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.580" end="01:37:35.270" style="s2">here and now I&#39;m going beyond what they</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.450" end="01:37:37.190" style="s2">say in the experiment I&#39;m going to start</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.270" end="01:37:38.450" style="s2">with what&#39;s directly implied by what</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.190" end="01:37:40.340" style="s2">they&#39;re saying and then I&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.450" end="01:37:42.410" style="s2">beyond in a way they might not have</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.340" end="01:37:43.850" style="s2">thought to talk about I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.410" end="01:37:44.060" style="s2">did consistent with what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.850" end="01:37:46.550" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.060" end="01:37:48.880" style="s2">okay so this is slowly progressing more</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.550" end="01:37:52.070" style="s2">more into my voice out of their voice</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.880" end="01:37:54.020" style="s2">now what they&#39;re initially talking about</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.070" end="01:37:57.580" style="s2">it looks like is your compact is your</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.020" end="01:37:57.580" style="s2">capacity for pattern depletion</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.070" end="01:38:15.760" style="s2">and you panicked a pattern completion</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.720" end="01:38:18.580" style="s2">right it is very interesting ability</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.760" end="01:38:21.610" style="s2">that you have one thing you should know</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.580" end="01:38:24.340" style="s2">is the ability to do this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.610" end="01:38:26.740" style="s2">best tests we have for your general</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.340" end="01:38:41.980" style="s2">intelligence Ravens progressive matrices</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.740" end="01:38:44.560" style="s2">right yes are typically consisted but</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.980" end="01:38:50.800" style="s2">are not consistent enough to generalize</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.560" end="01:38:53.650" style="s2">someone has ADHD or that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.800" end="01:38:55.990" style="s2">really specific problem sure at the pump</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.650" end="01:39:04.450" style="s2">that they can&#39;t forgive the comparative</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.990" end="01:39:06.370" style="s2">standards right so areas that are using</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.450" end="01:39:09.490" style="s2">some types of problems on the nitrous</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.370" end="01:39:10.660" style="s2">but not in others well I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.490" end="01:39:12.580" style="s2">sure I agree with the second thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.660" end="01:39:14.890" style="s2">you&#39;re saying but before I address that</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.580" end="01:39:16.360" style="s2">let me just the first thing right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.890" end="01:39:18.790" style="s2">none of these measures are perfect but</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.360" end="01:39:20.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no measure the in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.790" end="01:39:23.050" style="s2">that&#39;s better than our measures for gene</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.680" end="01:39:25.840" style="s2">in terms of its predictive capacity of</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.050" end="01:39:28.360" style="s2">idiot nothing comes close to Jesus ility</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.840" end="01:39:31.420" style="s2">to predict your academic success or life</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.360" end="01:39:34.810" style="s2">success you&#39;re like your health success</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.420" end="01:39:36.670" style="s2">it is our most powerful predictor so is</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.810" end="01:39:38.860" style="s2">it perfect no but it&#39;s really strong</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.670" end="01:39:41.080" style="s2">it&#39;s really powerful so it&#39;s getting at</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.860" end="01:39:41.880" style="s2">something so I think it should be</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.080" end="01:39:45.850" style="s2">treated that way</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.880" end="01:39:48.640" style="s2">secondly the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.850" end="01:39:50.470" style="s2">different types of intelligences it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.640" end="01:39:53.290" style="s2">that what you&#39;re suggesting okay let me</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.470" end="01:39:55.450" style="s2">address that person that is a very that</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.290" end="01:39:57.790" style="s2">as mom received empirical confirmation</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.450" end="01:40:02.020" style="s2">that hypothesis so the multiple</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.790" end="01:40:03.940" style="s2">intelligence ideas etc there let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.020" end="01:40:05.330" style="s2">if you&#39;re not saying so what is it other</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.940" end="01:40:07.400" style="s2">than that that Europe</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.330" end="01:40:10.580" style="s2">properly what I&#39;m saying is like it</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.400" end="01:40:12.890" style="s2">because of someone who has ADHD place</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.580" end="01:40:14.990" style="s2">them with pattern conclusion based on</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.890" end="01:40:17.450" style="s2">working memory other types of</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.990" end="01:40:21.260" style="s2">problem-solving ability so you get 99th</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.450" end="01:40:24.800" style="s2">percentile in one and like 38 percentile</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.260" end="01:40:26.930" style="s2">and the other not an accurate measure</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.800" end="01:40:31.580" style="s2">unit of problem-solving let alone of</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.930" end="01:40:34.820" style="s2">like different types of life skills so</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.580" end="01:40:36.380" style="s2">because you&#39;re not measuring obviously</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.820" end="01:40:38.330" style="s2">flip through certain types of learning</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.380" end="01:40:40.760" style="s2">disabilities also that can follow</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.330" end="01:40:42.860" style="s2">similar pattern that is obviously</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.760" end="01:40:44.750" style="s2">between that type of higher education</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.860" end="01:40:49.370" style="s2">problems on another type of problem</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.750" end="01:40:51.680" style="s2">solving and what song to do but but but</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.370" end="01:40:53.810" style="s2">I mean first of all if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.680" end="01:40:55.280" style="s2">about pathological cases and the top of</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.810" end="01:40:57.830" style="s2">our table all of you might be exactly</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.280" end="01:40:59.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s breaking down is the fact</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.830" end="01:41:01.940" style="s2">that in general there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.480" end="01:41:04.130" style="s2">positive manifold between those tests</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.940" end="01:41:05.450" style="s2">how you do on these tests is strongly</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.130" end="01:41:07.100" style="s2">predictive of how you doing all the</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.450" end="01:41:09.470" style="s2">others suggesting there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.100" end="01:41:11.720" style="s2">ability under underneath them and once</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.470" end="01:41:13.670" style="s2">again that general ability measure is a</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.720" end="01:41:16.430" style="s2">very powerful predictor across many</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.670" end="01:41:18.730" style="s2">domains so the fact that in some</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.430" end="01:41:21.140" style="s2">individuals it might be breaking down is</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.730" end="01:41:23.180" style="s2">not evident depression or the way he</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.140" end="01:41:24.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist it might be that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.180" end="01:41:28.750" style="s2">actually being affected is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.800" end="01:41:28.750" style="s2">generalizability of the ability right</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.070" end="01:41:38.150" style="s2">well you don&#39;t what is it you want it to</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.010" end="01:41:40.910" style="s2">you you&#39;re not saying that that your IQ</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.150" end="01:41:43.040" style="s2">is unaffected by learning disabilities</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.910" end="01:41:45.440" style="s2">or things like that I&#39;m not you saying</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.040" end="01:41:49.180" style="s2">well I mean that&#39;s one part that can or</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.440" end="01:41:51.950" style="s2">can&#39;t be depending on the Texas for you</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.180" end="01:41:54.050" style="s2">but like that&#39;s not how to say like if</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.950" end="01:41:55.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between that just</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.050" end="01:41:59.540" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously something that bears</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.970" end="01:42:02.320" style="s2">on some of these measures but not others</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.540" end="01:42:02.320" style="s2">and like how</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.230" end="01:42:11.540" style="s2">ah Asians that look at you really well</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.830" end="01:42:14.780" style="s2">in one too badly the other really well</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.540" end="01:42:17.210" style="s2">the other evaluate the second most and</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.780" end="01:42:19.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not completely in problems on</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.210" end="01:42:21.620" style="s2">this something that&#39;s causing the</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.760" end="01:42:26.840" style="s2">ability of them not to be associated</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.620" end="01:42:29.270" style="s2">sure sure they&#39;re different no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.840" end="01:42:30.920" style="s2">not good evidence it&#39;s good evidence but</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.270" end="01:42:32.840" style="s2">they&#39;re not identical but this claim was</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.920" end="01:42:34.820" style="s2">never that they were identical processes</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.840" end="01:42:37.550" style="s2">the subtests are all somehow capping</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.820" end="01:42:39.140" style="s2">into an underlying core general mobility</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.550" end="01:42:41.180" style="s2">that&#39;s what explains the consistent</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.140" end="01:42:43.070" style="s2">positive manifold and the ability again</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.180" end="01:42:46.640" style="s2">for that mindful to predict across all</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.070" end="01:42:48.230" style="s2">of many different domains of life so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.640" end="01:42:51.200" style="s2">not quite sure what the thesis is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.230" end="01:42:53.600" style="s2">criticizing or what you&#39;re like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.200" end="01:42:55.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s a general ability behind it</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.600" end="01:42:58.010" style="s2">the evidence for that is very strong so</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.490" end="01:42:59.660" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is somehow in certain</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.010" end="01:43:01.610" style="s2">individuals that get skewed so that the</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.660" end="01:43:03.770" style="s2">general ability goes here but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.610" end="01:43:04.700" style="s2">go there yeah I agree with that what</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.770" end="01:43:06.980" style="s2">what follows from that</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.700" end="01:43:10.040" style="s2">well expose be different so that you</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.980" end="01:43:11.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s introducing that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.040" end="01:43:13.550" style="s2">allowed to further inland would it be</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.480" end="01:43:16.610" style="s2">different because we can get different</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.550" end="01:43:19.610" style="s2">results but why would the general</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.610" end="01:43:21.140" style="s2">ability for something action if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.610" end="01:43:22.700" style="s2">saying like it can be one way or the</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.140" end="01:43:25.820" style="s2">other through the something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.700" end="01:43:29.180" style="s2">affecting that&#39;s Cuba before I was just</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.820" end="01:43:31.700" style="s2">thinking like obviously the results that</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.180" end="01:43:36.280" style="s2">are produced this correlation that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.700" end="01:43:39.440" style="s2">always because like that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.280" end="01:43:42.530" style="s2">accounted for in some way and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.440" end="01:43:44.840" style="s2">saying that they do right so here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.530" end="01:43:46.670" style="s2">way so what also is highly correlated</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.840" end="01:43:49.280" style="s2">with measures of general intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.670" end="01:43:52.310" style="s2">are measured measures of working memory</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.280" end="01:43:54.620" style="s2">capacity and things like attention can</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.310" end="01:43:58.100" style="s2">alter how working memory is being used</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.620" end="01:44:00.860" style="s2">so ADHD could skew working memory which</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.100" end="01:44:02.000" style="s2">could then skew the general ability is</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.860" end="01:44:04.760" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.000" end="01:44:08.090" style="s2">that would be one way exactly did I</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.760" end="01:44:10.100" style="s2">understand the question and again there</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.090" end="01:44:11.420" style="s2">is a dependent measure so independent up</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.100" end="01:44:14.150" style="s2">things like Ravens progressive matrices</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.420" end="01:44:16.220" style="s2">these independent measures that working</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.150" end="01:44:19.760" style="s2">memory use is also highly predictive of</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.220" end="01:44:22.400" style="s2">your general intelligence abilities and</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.760" end="01:44:25.220" style="s2">we know of course that attention alters</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.400" end="01:44:26.630" style="s2">how you&#39;re using your working memory so</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.220" end="01:44:27.980" style="s2">if you had something that was affecting</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.630" end="01:44:30.380" style="s2">attention you can see working memory</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.980" end="01:44:32.090" style="s2">which could then affect your general</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.380" end="01:44:34.670" style="s2">intelligence be implemented in one way</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.090" end="01:44:36.830" style="s2">rather than another right okay for an</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.670" end="01:44:38.660" style="s2">answer okay there was another question</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.830" end="01:44:40.850" style="s2">is um everyone might notice like</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.660" end="01:44:42.020" style="s2">initially measured capacity for poverty</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.850" end="01:44:44.660" style="s2">completion I was just wondering with</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.020" end="01:44:46.790" style="s2">what that is so before I got into the</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.660" end="01:44:49.790" style="s2">discussion with Chloe what I was what I</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.790" end="01:44:54.530" style="s2">was saying is that what we&#39;re measuring</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.790" end="01:44:57.140" style="s2">what what a percentage NTP are measuring</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.530" end="01:44:59.480" style="s2">in experiment I would say is plausibly</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.140" end="01:45:02.480" style="s2">pattern completion and when I was saying</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.480" end="01:45:04.040" style="s2">is one of our strongest tasks for your</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.480" end="01:45:06.980" style="s2">intelligence ability your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.040" end="01:45:08.870" style="s2">solve to solve problems is a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.980" end="01:45:10.790" style="s2">completion test and Ravens progressive</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.870" end="01:45:12.650" style="s2">matrices and then that&#39;s how we got into</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.790" end="01:45:15.440" style="s2">the discussion about sort of measures of</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.650" end="01:45:17.060" style="s2">general intelligence okay now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.440" end="01:45:23.120" style="s2">interesting about pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.060" end="01:45:25.070" style="s2">and okay this is meant to be again</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.120" end="01:45:28.190" style="s2">stepped towards a theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.070" end="01:45:29.690" style="s2">formulation is that prior completion</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.190" end="01:45:31.970" style="s2">abilities were actually have</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.690" end="01:45:34.340" style="s2">traditionally very difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.970" end="01:45:37.550" style="s2">standard computational machines to carry</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.340" end="01:45:39.890" style="s2">up the reason for that is that product</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.550" end="01:45:42.320" style="s2">completion had a pattern completion</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.890" end="01:45:44.120" style="s2">problems are all often but are called</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.320" end="01:45:46.540" style="s2">multiple simultaneous constraint</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.120" end="01:45:46.540" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.469" end="01:45:54.280" style="s2">I notice we should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.600" end="01:45:57.280" style="s2">this because we already put aside the</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.280" end="01:46:01.900" style="s2">idea of a single constraint multiple</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.280" end="01:46:03.820" style="s2">simultaneous constraint problems okay so</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.900" end="01:46:06.100" style="s2">let me give you the classic example and</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.820" end="01:46:17.230" style="s2">then let&#39;s talk about how it was solved</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.100" end="01:46:18.520" style="s2">okay so you can do things like this so</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.230" end="01:46:22.570" style="s2">you can read that and what know what</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.520" end="01:46:26.110" style="s2">does it say okay here you read this as</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.570" end="01:46:29.290" style="s2">an H and you read it here add a name</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.110" end="01:46:32.020" style="s2">okay now this was actually a very</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.290" end="01:46:33.550" style="s2">difficult problem because if you try to</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.020" end="01:46:35.830" style="s2">represent this sort of initially</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.550" end="01:46:38.290" style="s2">inferential e you can get into weird</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.830" end="01:46:40.630" style="s2">kind of binds because this is what you</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.290" end="01:46:43.840" style="s2">ill said in order to read the word I</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.630" end="01:46:46.480" style="s2">have to meet the individual letters but</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.840" end="01:46:48.850" style="s2">in order to disambiguate the letters I</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.480" end="01:46:54.550" style="s2">have to be the word which means reading</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.850" end="01:46:56.860" style="s2">is impossible because until I read the</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.550" end="01:46:58.300" style="s2">word the letters are immediate but I</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.860" end="01:46:58.719" style="s2">can&#39;t read the word until I can read the</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.300" end="01:47:00.640" style="s2">letters</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.719" end="01:47:01.870" style="s2">therefore we need two possible so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.640" end="01:47:05.380" style="s2">an illusion what you&#39;re doing is this</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.870" end="01:47:07.449" style="s2">available okay now what the answer was</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.380" end="01:47:09.160" style="s2">what is the answer by the way what do</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.449" end="01:47:12.520" style="s2">you don&#39;t pop the answer I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.160" end="01:47:17.560" style="s2">what like how do we do this what do you</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.520" end="01:47:19.630" style="s2">think Jess you write to simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.560" end="01:47:24.520" style="s2">pop down the bottom our process begin a</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.630" end="01:47:26.500" style="s2">self-organizing fashion pattern</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.520" end="01:47:28.110" style="s2">recognition seems to involve having to</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.500" end="01:47:30.850" style="s2">be able to mile multiple simultaneous</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.110" end="01:47:32.469" style="s2">constraints by doing self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.850" end="01:47:34.680" style="s2">processing that is working</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.469" end="01:47:38.370" style="s2">simultaneously top down and bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.680" end="01:47:41.370" style="s2">I&#39;m using a non-controversial example</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.370" end="01:47:41.370" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.360" end="01:47:47.290" style="s2">now the machines that turned out to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.800" end="01:47:49.960" style="s2">very good at doing this in contrast to</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.290" end="01:47:51.489" style="s2">standard computational machine and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.960" end="01:47:52.930" style="s2">people who first solve this problem of</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.489" end="01:47:54.760" style="s2">people like David Romo heart and</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.930" end="01:47:56.230" style="s2">Geoffrey Hinton because they were able</p>

<p begin="01:51:24.749" end="01:51:30.479" style="s2">in here when doing the Hat and notice</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.229" end="01:51:32.789" style="s2">that there is an aspect of your</p>

<p begin="01:51:40.409" end="01:51:45.479" style="s2">is frequently involved is attention</p>

<p begin="01:51:45.479" end="01:51:51.360" style="s2">you that grab your attention but I can</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.090" end="01:51:55.409" style="s2">also drive a top-down house your right</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.360" end="01:51:58.769" style="s2">big toe doing right now okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.409" end="01:52:00.360" style="s2">and of course the two right are always</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.769" end="01:52:02.070" style="s2">interacting you&#39;re trying to grab your</p>

<p begin="01:52:03.449" end="01:52:07.650" style="s2">attention that will grab your attention</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.889" end="01:52:09.959" style="s2">and people are talking more and more</p>

<p begin="01:52:25.709" end="01:52:29.880" style="s2">so Islam Baker and CeCe&#39;s task is</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.380" end="01:52:30.889" style="s2">related to like you know account</p>

<p begin="01:52:30.889" end="01:52:35.389" style="s2">and purpose that pattern of recognition</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.719" end="01:52:38.719" style="s2">is like related to in is items only and</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.389" end="01:52:40.880" style="s2">if you know it&#39;s what they&#39;re measuring</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.719" end="01:52:42.770" style="s2">is like kind of indicated with like IQ</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.880" end="01:52:45.260" style="s2">and pattern recognition gear like you</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.770" end="01:52:47.330" style="s2">would like this insights problem-solving</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.260" end="01:52:49.400" style="s2">and IQ blatantly different there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.330" end="01:52:52.310" style="s2">problem with that and this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.400" end="01:52:54.290" style="s2">Sternberg&#39;s criticisms of it so standard</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.310" end="01:52:56.210" style="s2">IQ measures are not predictive of</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.290" end="01:52:59.900" style="s2">insight because guess what most of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.210" end="01:53:02.000" style="s2">problems are in in standard IQ measures</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.900" end="01:53:05.030" style="s2">they&#39;re all well-defined problems and</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.000" end="01:53:08.030" style="s2">very few of them involved this what</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.030" end="01:53:10.219" style="s2">surberg has done is he has taken and I</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.030" end="01:53:13.810" style="s2">do more this in 371 he&#39;s taken standard</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.219" end="01:53:16.040" style="s2">IQ tests and then added to them insight</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.810" end="01:53:17.780" style="s2">problem-solving and produced a measure</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.040" end="01:53:19.610" style="s2">that combines the two and that turns out</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.780" end="01:53:22.219" style="s2">to be much better predictor than</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.610" end="01:53:23.570" style="s2">standard IQ measures for academic</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.219" end="01:53:25.550" style="s2">success blah blah blah blah blah and</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.570" end="01:53:28.310" style="s2">stuff like that autumn so like with</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.550" end="01:53:30.020" style="s2">arabian psychometric ski like on example</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.310" end="01:53:31.550" style="s2">like something that&#39;s very good because</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.020" end="01:53:34.130" style="s2">it feels like it would be like very it</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.550" end="01:53:38.929" style="s2">should be both yeah yeah yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.130" end="01:53:41.510" style="s2">too and that this this is leaping ahead</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.929" end="01:53:43.040" style="s2">so I can&#39;t immediately justify what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.510" end="01:53:44.510" style="s2">going to say but a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.040" end="01:53:46.580" style="s2">arguing that what you&#39;re measuring when</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.510" end="01:53:48.170" style="s2">you&#39;re measuring sort of especially like</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.580" end="01:53:50.239" style="s2">the fluid aspects of G is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.170" end="01:53:52.159" style="s2">measuring cognitive flexibility right</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.239" end="01:53:53.570" style="s2">and that cognitive flexibility turns out</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.159" end="01:53:55.310" style="s2">to be the single biggest predictor of</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.570" end="01:53:57.080" style="s2">your capacity for insect problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.310" end="01:53:58.699" style="s2">okay now all of this is encouraging</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.080" end="01:54:00.710" style="s2">right because it means that we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.699" end="01:54:02.420" style="s2">right track then if we&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.710" end="01:54:04.340" style="s2">this core ability and it&#39;s pointing us</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.420" end="01:54:06.199" style="s2">back to sort of core measures and core</p>

<p begin="01:54:06.199" end="01:54:11.659" style="s2">then we&#39;re on the right track then we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:54:17.719" end="01:54:20.480" style="s2">yet picked up we just good for you right</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.460" end="01:54:26.050" style="s2">because you want to know what your</p>

<p begin="01:55:54.949" end="01:55:59.420" style="s2">ok yeah so there and people can move</p>

<p begin="01:55:59.420" end="01:56:02.540" style="s2">interestingly enough there&#39;s been some</p>

<p begin="01:56:02.540" end="01:56:08.360" style="s2">in the course that you should trust you</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.040" end="01:56:09.890" style="s2">should give quite a bit of trust when</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.360" end="01:56:12.130" style="s2">you solve your problems by insight</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.890" end="01:56:14.310" style="s2">process but they do tend to</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.130" end="01:56:18.400" style="s2">better solutions than your intramental</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.310" end="01:56:20.020" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to that again it is</p>

<p begin="01:56:20.020" end="01:56:26.290" style="s2">constraints all right let&#39;s get back to</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.179" end="01:56:28.900" style="s2">Baker service and see all right so again</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.290" end="01:56:30.310" style="s2">what did they said they gave a bitch up</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.900" end="01:56:32.350" style="s2">they just embraced up they</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.310" end="01:56:34.389" style="s2">operationalize anything I think this</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.350" end="01:56:35.860" style="s2">means it would inductively permit to</p>

<p begin="01:56:35.860" end="01:56:41.110" style="s2">induction that&#39;s like some induction</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.830" end="01:56:43.600" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe abduction but it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.110" end="01:56:46.030" style="s2">induction well you&#39;re not like you not</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.600" end="01:56:48.190" style="s2">think I have this pattern of dots then</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.030" end="01:56:50.800" style="s2">they&#39;re all black so all these are</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.190" end="01:56:51.790" style="s2">private it&#39;s not induction right so</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.800" end="01:56:54.219" style="s2">let&#39;s put that aside</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.790" end="01:56:56.710" style="s2">so these not positively thing and then</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.219" end="01:56:58.360" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible especially given the way</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.710" end="01:57:00.190" style="s2">they described it at what they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:58:32.660" end="01:58:41.090" style="s2">maybe this is also why I can maybe right</p>

<p begin="01:58:51.830" end="01:58:57.290" style="s2">insight seems so procedural in nature is</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.040" end="01:59:00.610" style="s2">precisely because it&#39;s exactly this kind</p>

<p begin="02:00:10.990" end="02:00:17.600" style="s2">alright now the search inference</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.840" end="02:00:21.640" style="s2">framework around right around this time</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.600" end="02:00:24.650" style="s2">sort of after Metcalfe left before</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.640" end="02:00:27.880" style="s2">children Belcher and before that figure</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.650" end="02:00:31.600" style="s2">seventies he has one of its best replies</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.880" end="02:00:35.180" style="s2">to the work especially of Metcalfe and</p>

<p begin="02:00:35.180" end="02:00:46.340" style="s2">into it again and this is the worth of</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.310" end="02:00:49.400" style="s2">capital sided right from 1990 okay and</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.340" end="02:00:53.300" style="s2">this is indeed left by men from Newell</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.400" end="02:00:56.930" style="s2">and Simon and now I hope you understand</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.300" end="02:01:00.710" style="s2">better the joke in the title of their</p>

<p begin="02:01:17.920" end="02:01:22.179" style="s2">there is such a thing but what are they</p>

<p begin="02:01:38.260" end="02:01:43.360" style="s2">can get into stuff more deeply if you</p>

<p begin="02:01:43.360" end="02:01:57.369" style="s2">is theoretical today okay so they are</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.059" end="02:01:59.619" style="s2">going to study something I talked about</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.369" end="02:02:01.510" style="s2">my foreshadowed busy squirming when I</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.619" end="02:02:04.090" style="s2">mentioned this to you before in the</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.510" end="02:02:05.650" style="s2">first class we talked about they use the</p>

<p begin="02:02:10.869" end="02:02:14.739" style="s2">corners and the inside is to realize</p>

<p begin="02:02:16.599" end="02:02:20.170" style="s2">as a parity problem and if you do</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.639" end="02:02:22.780" style="s2">because would be coming from it closer</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.170" end="02:02:28.320" style="s2">to their capital so they&#39;re all nodding</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.780" end="02:02:31.119" style="s2">your number yeah now what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.320" end="02:02:35.710" style="s2">first of all is that is to look at their</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.119" end="02:02:38.639" style="s2">theoretical response because okay this</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.710" end="02:02:40.809" style="s2">is absurd putting a lot of time right</p>

<p begin="02:02:40.809" end="02:02:45.369" style="s2">it okay what they&#39;re doing is really</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.479" end="02:02:48.460" style="s2">cool and if there&#39;s maybe something sort</p>

<p begin="02:02:48.460" end="02:02:51.079" style="s2">theoretical move I think I&#39;ll try and</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.320" end="02:02:52.760" style="s2">give you on</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.079" end="02:02:54.590" style="s2">but there&#39;s something really right about</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.760" end="02:02:56.270" style="s2">it because it&#39;s prescient it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.590" end="02:02:58.429" style="s2">impressive they come up with something</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.270" end="02:03:01.159" style="s2">abstractly that&#39;s going to turn out to</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.429" end="02:03:05.949" style="s2">be discovered concretely and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.159" end="02:03:05.949" style="s2">going on in the brain it&#39;s really cool</p>

<p begin="02:03:21.260" end="02:03:24.860" style="s2">in a very prescient man and I think it</p>

<p begin="02:03:40.599" end="02:03:47.739" style="s2">doesn&#39;t published in 1919 and that was a</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.250" end="02:03:47.739" style="s2">response it&#39;s a response to Metcalfe</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.839" end="02:04:03.819" style="s2">so what they do remember is Jay agreed</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.119" end="02:04:06.969" style="s2">that insight exists they talk about it</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.819" end="02:04:08.829" style="s2">as restructuring a problem formulation</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.969" end="02:04:11.709" style="s2">and then the operations problem</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.829" end="02:04:15.550" style="s2">formulation as a search for a problem</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.709" end="02:04:19.479" style="s2">formulation and what they do then is</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.550" end="02:04:23.439" style="s2">they divide well they divide problems of</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.479" end="02:04:33.209" style="s2">inside bomb solving into two levels of</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.439" end="02:04:42.249" style="s2">analysis there is a primary level and</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.209" end="02:04:43.989" style="s2">then there&#39;s the metal level so the</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.249" end="02:04:46.449" style="s2">primary level is the level at which</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.989" end="02:04:54.429" style="s2">you&#39;re searching for a solution to your</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.449" end="02:04:55.919" style="s2">problem so one thing this is not wise</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.429" end="02:04:57.489" style="s2">for going all this memory</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.919" end="02:04:59.709" style="s2">compartmentalization even though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.489" end="02:05:02.139" style="s2">drawing these boxes this is not this is</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.709" end="02:05:04.510" style="s2">a different thing a lot more respect to</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.139" end="02:05:07.149" style="s2">this like I start going to argue later</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.510" end="02:05:09.849" style="s2">that is prescient it shows again a value</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.149" end="02:05:13.899" style="s2">of theoretical debate it&#39;s a poor child</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.849" end="02:05:17.769" style="s2">and a time for war in the future</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.899" end="02:05:20.499" style="s2">okay so the idea of complement and Simon</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.769" end="02:05:21.969" style="s2">is there&#39;s a primary level you trying</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.499" end="02:05:25.479" style="s2">this is where you&#39;re searching for a</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.969" end="02:05:26.679" style="s2">solution to a problem you can&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.479" end="02:05:29.739" style="s2">solution perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.679" end="02:05:33.459" style="s2">combinatorially explosive what you then</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.739" end="02:05:36.010" style="s2">do is you shift to a meta level this is</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.459" end="02:05:38.559" style="s2">not the level of a formulated problem</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.010" end="02:05:39.969" style="s2">this search space is a search stage</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.559" end="02:05:42.629" style="s2">through all possible problem</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.969" end="02:05:42.629" style="s2">formulations</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.830" end="02:05:54.130" style="s2">so this is the subspace of profit</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.790" end="02:05:57.300" style="s2">formulations this is the search space of</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.130" end="02:05:57.300" style="s2">a formulated problem</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.360" end="02:06:09.469" style="s2">the main idea the main idea is this is</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.179" end="02:06:12.460" style="s2">what you try get this doesn&#39;t work you</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.469" end="02:06:14.989" style="s2">switch to this space you find a</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.460" end="02:06:17.090" style="s2">alternative problem formulation you</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.989" end="02:06:18.679" style="s2">bring it back to here and then that</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.090" end="02:06:21.079" style="s2">affords you solving the problem and</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.679" end="02:06:25.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what inside is inside in this</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.079" end="02:06:29.059" style="s2">movement to at right and then back from</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.010" end="02:06:31.309" style="s2">the next phase that restructures this</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.059" end="02:06:38.329" style="s2">problem space so that it becomes</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.309" end="02:06:40.599" style="s2">solvable for you first again this is</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.329" end="02:06:44.440" style="s2">going to turn them kind of shifting</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.599" end="02:06:47.869" style="s2">right it&#39;s going to turn out to be</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.440" end="02:06:50.630" style="s2">relevant notice how this is intelligent</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.869" end="02:06:54.320" style="s2">because they can possibly say that the</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.630" end="02:06:57.739" style="s2">shifting is what&#39;s reflected in the</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.320" end="02:07:00.889" style="s2">sudden spike shifting when you come back</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.739" end="02:07:03.679" style="s2">that&#39;s when you get it right so very</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.889" end="02:07:05.809" style="s2">plausible like I said it&#39;s going to turn</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.679" end="02:07:07.849" style="s2">out I&#39;ll just force you out then this</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.809" end="02:07:10.010" style="s2">seems to map on to sort of hemisphere</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.849" end="02:07:11.920" style="s2">hemispheric shipping and processing that</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.010" end="02:07:14.270" style="s2">seems to be correlated with in stuff</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.920" end="02:07:27.949" style="s2">which also seems to be correlated with</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.270" end="02:07:32.119" style="s2">the mess yes ok now he is putting her</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.949" end="02:07:34.250" style="s2">finger on the very narrow theoretical</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.119" end="02:07:40.340" style="s2">phrase the Kaplan and Simon are trying</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.250" end="02:07:42.500" style="s2">to stand on the razor&#39;s edge because in</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.340" end="02:07:44.570" style="s2">order for this to all be computational</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.500" end="02:07:49.610" style="s2">the same kind of processing has to be</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.570" end="02:07:51.920" style="s2">going on here and yeah right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.610" end="02:07:54.079" style="s2">they want to argue but if the same type</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.920" end="02:07:57.050" style="s2">of processing is going on here and here</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.079" end="02:08:00.469" style="s2">and if if this space is a small space</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.050" end="02:08:02.550" style="s2">now it&#39;s probably what kind of space</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.469" end="02:08:05.160" style="s2">how much are responsive</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.550" end="02:08:07.170" style="s2">so exactly the same thing is going on</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.160" end="02:08:09.680" style="s2">here and here is that going to make any</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.170" end="02:08:12.720" style="s2">difference which is your point efficient</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.680" end="02:08:16.350" style="s2">so what they need this is the hard place</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.720" end="02:08:19.080" style="s2">to get into they need the process going</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.350" end="02:08:21.180" style="s2">on here to be different in try to</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.080" end="02:08:22.530" style="s2">prevent the infinite regress because you</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.180" end="02:08:24.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say well you know I do</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.530" end="02:08:28.380" style="s2">here I go to another space to look for</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.930" end="02:08:30.180" style="s2">brought the formulation ok so the way</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.380" end="02:08:31.980" style="s2">pretending you&#39;re going to address is</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.180" end="02:08:33.930" style="s2">that there have to be an important</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.980" end="02:08:39.030" style="s2">difference in kind is in one stage in</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.930" end="02:08:41.790" style="s2">another stage right so what they need to</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.030" end="02:08:43.680" style="s2">say one part of their mouth if I can use</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.790" end="02:08:47.280" style="s2">that metaphor we speaking of deciding</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.680" end="02:08:49.080" style="s2">another time one side has to say the</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.280" end="02:08:50.610" style="s2">process is going on here has to be</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.080" end="02:08:54.330" style="s2">different in kind from the processing</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.610" end="02:08:56.820" style="s2">going on there that&#39;s in order to</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.330" end="02:08:58.620" style="s2">prevent the infinite regress but the</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.820" end="02:09:01.620" style="s2">other side of your mouth has to say ah</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.620" end="02:09:05.400" style="s2">but this is all just computational</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.620" end="02:09:07.670" style="s2">processing because that is how we are</p>

<p begin="02:09:07.670" end="02:09:13.710" style="s2">against the dish stalls alternative now</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.580" end="02:09:16.260" style="s2">let me be really careful here because</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.710" end="02:09:17.940" style="s2">then this is subtle I get this</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.260" end="02:09:20.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a subtle in abstract thinking</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.940" end="02:09:22.290" style="s2">which is hard I get that too I am not</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.820" end="02:09:24.300" style="s2">accusing them of the contradiction</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.290" end="02:09:27.210" style="s2">because I technically have not shown you</p>

<p begin="02:09:27.210" end="02:09:32.640" style="s2">though is that this is a very very</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.910" end="02:09:35.370" style="s2">narrow theoretical space they have it</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.640" end="02:09:37.800" style="s2">somehow to say it&#39;s different in kind</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.370" end="02:09:40.350" style="s2">right for the infinite regress is</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.800" end="02:09:43.020" style="s2">blocked but it&#39;s basically still the</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.350" end="02:09:45.870" style="s2">same stuff the same kind of</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.020" end="02:09:48.450" style="s2">computational processes and that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="02:09:50.490" end="02:09:54.890" style="s2">close</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.150" end="02:09:54.890" style="s2">did that pick up on your point</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.110" end="02:10:03.119" style="s2">okay so they&#39;re in a very tight space</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.329" end="02:10:04.669" style="s2">okay one more time although I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:10:11.209" end="02:10:16.320" style="s2">secondly there&#39;s something again this is</p>

<p begin="02:10:16.320" end="02:10:21.360" style="s2">something that seems to be the case this</p>

<p begin="02:10:37.340" end="02:10:44.369" style="s2">why is it a contradiction because there</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.739" end="02:10:46.650" style="s2">may be a way of saying it&#39;s like see</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.369" end="02:10:48.900" style="s2">because the line between differences of</p>

<p begin="02:11:28.409" end="02:11:36.599" style="s2">difference of time but to be know</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.919" end="02:11:38.340" style="s2">exactly where that is so they could say</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.599" end="02:11:42.419" style="s2">well it&#39;s a really big difference of</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.340" end="02:11:43.800" style="s2">degree but not completely a difference</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.419" end="02:11:46.439" style="s2">of kind and therefore it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.800" end="02:11:50.630" style="s2">contradiction that&#39;s a technical reason</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.439" end="02:11:50.630" style="s2">to be fair is that okay</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.150" end="02:12:03.700" style="s2">people obstinately do something useful</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.230" end="02:12:06.220" style="s2">stuff okay now they know this they know</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.700" end="02:12:07.360" style="s2">this problem so to bring it up is fair</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.220" end="02:12:09.310" style="s2">so why do I need it</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.360" end="02:12:15.790" style="s2">excellent because they themselves bring</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.310" end="02:12:17.800" style="s2">it up they realize right that they place</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.790" end="02:12:19.540" style="s2">up up now I want to be clear then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.800" end="02:12:21.760" style="s2">not miss attributing something to this</p>

<p begin="02:12:39.100" end="02:12:44.280" style="s2">that is the statement of there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.230" end="02:12:51.430" style="s2">fundamental difference between the two</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.280" end="02:12:53.950" style="s2">okay however they get that done that the</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.430" end="02:12:55.510" style="s2">level is combinatorial explosives and so</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.950" end="02:12:57.180" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to stay to prove the</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.510" end="02:13:00.570" style="s2">cracks and problem solving is</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.180" end="02:13:00.570" style="s2">selectivity in search</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.959" end="02:13:12.229" style="s2">so what they want is they want like</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.969" end="02:13:18.260" style="s2">something that gives of a kind of</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.229" end="02:13:22.880" style="s2">selectivity here it will operate</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.260" end="02:13:25.969" style="s2">differently than what operates here and</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.880" end="02:13:30.380" style="s2">so they propose a heuristic that</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.969" end="02:13:35.170" style="s2">operates at the meta level that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.380" end="02:13:35.170" style="s2">operating at the primary level</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.050" end="02:13:45.280" style="s2">so this is the you&#39;re putting all of</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.450" end="02:13:50.770" style="s2">their theoretical baskets into this</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.280" end="02:14:06.160" style="s2">EurAsEC it&#39;s called the notice invariant</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.770" end="02:14:08.200" style="s2">heuristic talk to some of the invited</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.160" end="02:14:11.790" style="s2">men will wrap up this part of your</p>

<p begin="02:14:13.320" end="02:14:19.030" style="s2">full of too many thoughts well I can</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.830" end="02:14:24.430" style="s2">tell you what any of them individually</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.030" end="02:14:25.840" style="s2">get okay so let&#39;s just talk about I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.430" end="02:14:27.430" style="s2">just briefly talk about it and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.840" end="02:14:28.990" style="s2">introduce the sort of point then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.430" end="02:14:30.430" style="s2">come back and pick up on it and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.990" end="02:14:33.550" style="s2">give a sort of going momentum in the</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.430" end="02:14:35.590" style="s2">next class okay the idea is that what</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.550" end="02:14:37.330" style="s2">you do is you try what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.590" end="02:14:39.550" style="s2">do is you&#39;re going to look at failed</p>

<p begin="02:14:39.550" end="02:14:44.140" style="s2">formulation is a network build problem</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.130" end="02:14:51.790" style="s2">formulation and here&#39;s another failed</p>
<p begin="02:14:44.140" end="02:14:55.000" style="s2">problem formulation okay so what should</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.790" end="02:14:57.040" style="s2">you try to notice what you can variant</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.000" end="02:14:59.410" style="s2">across all of these different failed</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.040" end="02:15:01.600" style="s2">public relations what is not changing</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.410" end="02:15:03.520" style="s2">what&#39;s not changing is this base for</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.600" end="02:15:07.630" style="s2">example you see this pictorial</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.520" end="02:15:10.150" style="s2">okay try to notice what&#39;s not changing</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.630" end="02:15:16.090" style="s2">across your failed problem formulations</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.150" end="02:15:18.670" style="s2">you want because you&#39;re failing there is</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.090" end="02:15:22.470" style="s2">probably a common cause to all of you</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.670" end="02:15:25.780" style="s2">individual failures that come cause</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.470" end="02:15:29.080" style="s2">possibly probably will not certainly</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.780" end="02:15:31.840" style="s2">probably is related to what is invariant</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.080" end="02:15:34.330" style="s2">in your comments on relation what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.840" end="02:15:36.790" style="s2">not changing that is preventing you from</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.330" end="02:15:40.150" style="s2">solving the problem so you try to notice</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.790" end="02:15:41.800" style="s2">what invariant and then that is what</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.150" end="02:15:42.670" style="s2">you&#39;re going to change in your problem</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.800" end="02:15:44.440" style="s2">formulation</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.670" end="02:15:46.600" style="s2">and that that is what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.440" end="02:15:50.760" style="s2">bring back down here to see that we</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.600" end="02:15:50.760" style="s2">formulate your problem that make sense</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.610" end="02:16:01.690" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of cool</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.420" end="02:16:04.800" style="s2">first of all so if they&#39;re going to take</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.690" end="02:16:08.110" style="s2">two more minutes how much you go okay</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.800" end="02:16:11.230" style="s2">notice how this saltiness heuristic is</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.110" end="02:16:13.810" style="s2">but notice I mean actually magic and by</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.230" end="02:16:19.210" style="s2">the way you cannot use it it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.810" end="02:16:23.550" style="s2">defaulting so adding on an English what</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.210" end="02:16:26.669" style="s2">is that subject to a German word crystal</p>

<p begin="02:17:02.130" end="02:17:09.660" style="s2">people had shown this is a very</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.360" end="02:17:14.220" style="s2">destructive heuristic it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.660" end="02:17:16.860" style="s2">operating very computationally that is</p>
<p begin="02:17:14.220" end="02:17:20.250" style="s2">also in addition to that right there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="02:17:20.250" end="02:17:27.780" style="s2">invariant across right something that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:17:27.780" end="02:17:35.280" style="s2">explosive so again it has to somehow be</p>

<p begin="02:17:42.340" end="02:17:47.559" style="s2">okay so what are we getting - we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.769" end="02:17:49.269" style="s2">getting to this point let me just wrap</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.559" end="02:17:51.519" style="s2">it up one one more minute and I&#39;ll let</p>

<p begin="02:18:04.689" end="02:18:09.099" style="s2">different kind of heuristic searcher is</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.179" end="02:18:10.239" style="s2">they operating at the metal level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.099" end="02:18:11.889" style="s2">going to turn out to be a really</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.239" end="02:18:13.719" style="s2">important idea by the way to notice and</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.889" end="02:18:16.000" style="s2">very seriously let&#39;s give all of that</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.719" end="02:18:19.840" style="s2">and this shifting idea and a different</p>

<p begin="02:18:43.679" end="02:18:49.599" style="s2">yes problem with this is it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="02:18:54.479" end="02:19:00.760" style="s2">or as they actually come up with a</p>
