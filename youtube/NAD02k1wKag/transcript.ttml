<p begin="00:00:00.530" end="00:00:04.859" style="s2">so hi there my name is Joe Brewer and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.240" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">I&#39;m the research director here at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.859" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">rules and today I&#39;m really excited to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">a short interview with Martin crook who</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll introduce in a moment who also</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:15.750" style="s2">works at the rules and for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">who have been following our work</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.750" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">recently you&#39;ll know that we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">currently involved in a campaign that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:24.029" style="s2">critical of the sustainable development</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">goals and trying to get at the root</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.029" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">issues that look at the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">causes of poverty and inequality and one</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">of the things that we have realized</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">while running this campaign and in other</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">campaigns in the past is that the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">that we go about this work prompts</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">people to tell us their personal stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">about how they relate to the work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">happening in development and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">sometimes those stories are quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">powerful just at a personal level they</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">really influence us and they bring us</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">inspiration and insight so we realized</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">for this campaign that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">highlight some of those stories and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">this video&#39;s is going to be online</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">accompanying a set of blog posts written</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">by people within the development sector</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">telling their personal stories and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">have right here in our midst a person</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">who has worked extensively in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">development sector and that has gone</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">through a process of radicalization or</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">changing from the norms of what people</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:23.909" style="s2">typically do there and that is our</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">colleague here Martin and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.909" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">his story might be enlightening for</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">others so we&#39;re recording this interview</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">so maybe to get started Martin could you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">just say who you are what is your role</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">at the rules and and then we&#39;ll go from</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">there sure I saw I&#39;m not some kind so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:43.399" style="s2">coordinated strategy for the rules and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">worked with Joe and our other colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.399" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">and one of the things that I think may</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">be helpful for setting some context here</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">for the viewers is too if you could tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">us how did you get into work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">development and poverty in the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">place you know what was the initial</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">feeling the passion that thing that got</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">you started what was that like for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">when you were younger yes I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:05.960" style="s2">doing international drug will work but</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">professionally</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.960" end="00:02:11.930" style="s2">15 years ago and it was an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.560" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">thrill I&#39;ve always wanted to work in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.930" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">this field it was like a natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:16.819" style="s2">placement to gravitate towards and I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:19.880" style="s2">thrilled when I got my first job in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.819" end="00:02:23.660" style="s2">big NGO a big international aid agency</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.880" end="00:02:25.690" style="s2">and I had an absolute blast and I look</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.660" end="00:02:27.950" style="s2">back at that time with a lot of fondness</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.690" end="00:02:32.360" style="s2">so it felt like I was doing something</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.950" end="00:02:34.970" style="s2">that touched my soul that that was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.360" end="00:02:36.350" style="s2">line with the purpose that I that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.970" end="00:02:38.120" style="s2">I have in the world that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.350" end="00:02:40.790" style="s2">interesting thing about the work we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:43.459" style="s2">here at the rules that we often take</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.790" end="00:02:45.800" style="s2">this almost a contrarian position where</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.459" end="00:02:48.380" style="s2">we&#39;re actively external to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.800" end="00:02:50.810" style="s2">development sector in critical of it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.380" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">that might prompt in people&#39;s minds this</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.810" end="00:02:55.550" style="s2">question if you were so happy working</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.880" end="00:02:58.670" style="s2">for big NGOs you know like Save the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.550" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">Children and Oxfam a-- what would what</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.670" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">was that process like for you to realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:06.140" style="s2">that maybe what you were doing wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">all rosy and sunshine and you know were</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.140" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">the first indicators that maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:13.100" style="s2">involved inside of those organizations</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">and inside the sector itself that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.100" end="00:03:16.010" style="s2">you might be complicit in some problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.870" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">you know what were what were you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.010" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">noticing there that first made you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:23.390" style="s2">uncomfortable my first discomfort really</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:25.100" style="s2">starts to come when I look to public</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.390" end="00:03:28.310" style="s2">attitudes of why people believe what</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.100" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">they do about poverty and inequality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.310" end="00:03:32.150" style="s2">it became very apparent relatively</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.549" style="s2">quickly when he starts to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.150" end="00:03:37.220" style="s2">science behind people&#39;s attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:39.799" style="s2">behaviors that they were locked in with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.220" end="00:03:42.019" style="s2">bias by a certain number of or a small</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.799" end="00:03:43.670" style="s2">number of essential stories that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.019" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">talked about global poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.670" end="00:03:48.170" style="s2">inequality particularly by those voices</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:51.530" style="s2">that speak the loudest the big NGOs the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.170" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">UN the World Bank and the very first one</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.530" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">of those stories that start to fall</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:57.769" style="s2">apart for me was the story about charity</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.420" style="s2">and the idea that the best response to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.769" end="00:04:01.790" style="s2">global or believe the legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.420" end="00:04:03.440" style="s2">response to global poverty is for rich</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:05.810" style="s2">people to give a little bit of money to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:08.090" style="s2">poor people and now I know that the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.810" end="00:04:09.769" style="s2">and you know that not all they say but</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.090" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">that is one of the essential story that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.769" end="00:04:15.560" style="s2">underpins their corporate proposition to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">the world and what I started to question</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.560" end="00:04:19.090" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.930" end="00:04:21.190" style="s2">let&#39;s go down the rabbit hole and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.090" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">other story started to unravel for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.190" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">and that eventually led me out of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:29.949" style="s2">NGOs to set up the rules so what was it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">specifically about charity that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.949" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">found so problematic maybe could you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:35.710" style="s2">unpack that a little bit more where</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">there are specific assumptions or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.710" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">beliefs that contradict your values or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">their deficit well with you what were</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:46.600" style="s2">those yes that&#39;s exactly what it was Joe</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:49.720" style="s2">it was a sense that charity propagates</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.600" end="00:04:53.259" style="s2">this idea that there is a moral order</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.720" end="00:04:55.449" style="s2">into the world and that poor people need</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.259" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">to get more like rich people and there</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.449" end="00:05:01.180" style="s2">is a moral equivalence made with virtue</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">being acquainted with wealth and poverty</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.180" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">being acquainted with a lack of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.289" style="s2">now plenty of people in NGOs absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">do not believe that but when we started</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.289" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">to deconstruct the language in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">imagery in the stories are they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:15.250" style="s2">telling what we found from a range of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">sources was that is actually exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.250" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">story that they are telling because they</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:20.889" style="s2">are so hooked on the charity story and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:22.539" style="s2">bear looked on the charity story because</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.889" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">they are from the charity business one</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.539" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">and when I started to realize that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.699" style="s2">started that you know the big divergence</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:32.620" style="s2">started to happen and I my own balance</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.699" end="00:05:35.139" style="s2">and my own understanding of how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.620" end="00:05:36.699" style="s2">world worked made it more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.139" end="00:05:39.099" style="s2">uncomfortable for me to be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.699" end="00:05:41.289" style="s2">within that story and propagating being</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.099" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">a part of an industry that propagated</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.289" end="00:05:47.289" style="s2">that story so over time I became more</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">and more uncomfortable and I found</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.289" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">myself feeling war a war against the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:54.550" style="s2">tide and eventually I was lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:57.370" style="s2">to be given the opportunity to follow</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.550" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">those values and the opportunity to help</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.370" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">set up the rules so I was very lucky but</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:04.300" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a very possible process for</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:05.710" style="s2">quite no I imagine it wasn&#39;t uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.300" end="00:06:08.590" style="s2">actually something I think it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.710" end="00:06:10.599" style="s2">crux of the other personal stories that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.590" end="00:06:12.460" style="s2">will be shared online that accompany</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.599" end="00:06:14.169" style="s2">this video there are people currently</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.460" end="00:06:18.099" style="s2">working with in the development sector</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.169" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">who have similar dissonance between how</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.099" end="00:06:22.300" style="s2">they feel about the work and the work</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">they feel they need to do and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.300" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">curious if you could share what was it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">like for you as you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.180" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">working within like let&#39;s let&#39;s take at</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:32.600" style="s2">the time when I met you when you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:34.430" style="s2">working at oxfam and we started</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.600" end="00:06:37.220" style="s2">deconstructing the language together</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:39.560" style="s2">this was about six years ago and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.220" end="00:06:41.449" style="s2">the rules was formed about three years</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.560" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">ago so there was this intervening period</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.449" end="00:06:46.130" style="s2">of several years where you had a growing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:48.889" style="s2">discomfort but you were still there so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.130" end="00:06:51.800" style="s2">what was that like for you to be him now</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.889" end="00:06:54.039" style="s2">tonight because we were covering we were</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.800" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">asking questions and recovering</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.039" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">realities truths that I thought would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">liberating because I felt liberating to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:03.590" style="s2">me I was like oh that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">feeling so uncomfortable ok now I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.590" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">some empirical well-documented pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:13.190" style="s2">uncontroversial uncontroversial kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:14.570" style="s2">scientific evidence to explain to me why</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.190" end="00:07:17.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve been feeling uncomfortable so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.570" end="00:07:19.310" style="s2">felt elated at first and over time I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.900" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">started to have these conversations more</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.310" end="00:07:23.330" style="s2">war within the sector and within other</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.789" style="s2">agencies and gradually I started become</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.330" end="00:07:28.520" style="s2">aware of the reality that these huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.789" end="00:07:30.440" style="s2">organizations cannot accept these truths</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.520" end="00:07:33.110" style="s2">very easily it&#39;s not that the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.440" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">inside and don&#39;t believe them it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.110" end="00:07:36.409" style="s2">even that there isn&#39;t an intent to move</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:39.020" style="s2">beyond some of these things is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.409" end="00:07:41.300" style="s2">these are huge complex organizations</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.020" end="00:07:43.010" style="s2">complex adaptive systems in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.300" end="00:07:45.560" style="s2">they can&#39;t just turn on a sixpence they</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.010" end="00:07:48.169" style="s2">can&#39;t just change their direction like</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.560" end="00:07:50.300" style="s2">this but where my discomfort really</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.169" end="00:07:52.789" style="s2">reached a peak was when I started to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.300" end="00:07:55.430" style="s2">people rejecting the logic and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.789" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">science because it provided too much of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.430" end="00:07:59.210" style="s2">a challenge water so I didn&#39;t mind that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:00.860" style="s2">it was going to take a long time what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.210" end="00:08:03.169" style="s2">minded that people didn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.860" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">willing to rise to the challenge and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.169" end="00:08:05.900" style="s2">was at that point that i came across</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">colleagues who helped me set up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.900" end="00:08:10.130" style="s2">walls and so i can bring the sigh of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:13.009" style="s2">relief and i could follow my own truths</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.130" end="00:08:16.039" style="s2">rather stay locked in the system that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.009" end="00:08:18.470" style="s2">felt profoundly compromised I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.039" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">this I think gets right at the crux of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.470" end="00:08:22.220" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.590" style="s2">sustainable development goals because</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.220" end="00:08:25.940" style="s2">you know 15 years ago the millennium</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.590" end="00:08:27.830" style="s2">development goals were formed and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.940" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">they&#39;ve had a profound influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.830" end="00:08:30.710" style="s2">trajectory of our planetary scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">economic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.710" end="00:08:35.660" style="s2">systems and political systems and here</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:38.720" style="s2">we are doing something of a reset where</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.660" end="00:08:40.760" style="s2">we are locking ourselves into or</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.720" end="00:08:42.710" style="s2">potentially locking ourselves into a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.760" end="00:08:45.470" style="s2">of conceptualizing economic development</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.710" end="00:08:47.300" style="s2">for another 15 years and the current</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.470" end="00:08:49.490" style="s2">state of the world you know I think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.300" end="00:08:51.290" style="s2">my own background in atmospheric science</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.490" end="00:08:53.270" style="s2">where we don&#39;t deal with the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.290" end="00:08:55.400" style="s2">causing global warming in the next 15</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.270" end="00:08:57.820" style="s2">years the consequences will be very dire</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.400" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">indeed so this is a time of rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.820" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">significant consequences and so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:06.350" style="s2">people are operating within the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.550" end="00:09:08.510" style="s2">that has been established by sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.350" end="00:09:11.030" style="s2">development goals and here we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.510" end="00:09:14.150" style="s2">actively critiquing them making some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.030" end="00:09:15.980" style="s2">our colleagues uncomfortable and and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.150" end="00:09:18.680" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering for the young people out</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.980" end="00:09:20.360" style="s2">there today who are really excited and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.680" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">passionate about changing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.360" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">they&#39;re coming into this moment and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">these are some of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:29.030" style="s2">happening this moment what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:33.080" style="s2">advice would you give to those people as</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.030" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">they uncover their own uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.080" end="00:09:37.100" style="s2">truths what would you say to them from</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">your place you know where you on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.100" end="00:09:42.710" style="s2">journey now yeah I&#39;d say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:44.150" style="s2">don&#39;t take change in the world keep you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.710" end="00:09:45.470" style="s2">on your own shoulders or your changing</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.150" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">your own organizations if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">starting to feel uncomfortable with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.050" style="s2">that passion you have is your greatest</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:52.670" style="s2">weapon so hold on to that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.050" end="00:09:56.330" style="s2">to agree with everybody all of the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:09:58.550" style="s2">in order to be make it stepping powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.330" end="00:10:01.190" style="s2">in your journey of uncovering the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.550" end="00:10:04.100" style="s2">the world works and improving your</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.190" end="00:10:06.590" style="s2">knowledge on that so so be patient with</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.100" end="00:10:09.050" style="s2">yourself be patient with others and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.590" end="00:10:11.270" style="s2">you do feel uncomfortable in your in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.050" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">your organization&#39;s or in your job or or</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.270" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">with the big development story that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:18.590" style="s2">sign of health that&#39;s a good thing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.630" style="s2">might feel bad in the moment because</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.590" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what social norms do to us when</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.630" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">we start the challenge of a question one</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">of the things one of their powers is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:29.750" style="s2">make us feel personally uncomfortable so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:31.340" style="s2">it&#39;s just important to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.750" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">that you understand that discomfort in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.340" end="00:10:35.270" style="s2">the right way that it doesn&#39;t even by</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">examining the social norm but if you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.270" end="00:10:40.130" style="s2">following we own your own true to your</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:41.690" style="s2">own journey of inquiry and exploration</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.130" end="00:10:43.310" style="s2">with integrity then</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.690" end="00:10:45.470" style="s2">that is the most important thing you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.310" end="00:10:49.520" style="s2">do it and these feelings of discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.470" end="00:10:50.960" style="s2">or passing out so stick with it find</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.520" end="00:10:53.450" style="s2">other people who are having the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.960" end="00:10:54.710" style="s2">sort of questions that you are how I got</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.450" end="00:10:57.110" style="s2">the people at the room because there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.710" end="00:10:59.780" style="s2">lots of us around in and around a circle</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.110" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">/ also feel the same way I know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.780" end="00:11:02.960" style="s2">there are lots and lots of other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:05.150" style="s2">an increasing number of people out there</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.960" end="00:11:08.690" style="s2">in the world who out on them saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.150" end="00:11:11.180" style="s2">save this comfort and even five years</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.690" end="00:11:12.830" style="s2">ago 10 years ago get one so many</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.180" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">alternative places you could find it</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.830" end="00:11:16.400" style="s2">good you could have these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:17.990" style="s2">about that these feelings you have there</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.400" end="00:11:19.310" style="s2">are more more of those places now so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">find them joined up with like-minded</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.310" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">photos and you&#39;ll be fine so I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:28.850" style="s2">basic takeaway here is really trust your</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:31.520" style="s2">intuition seek truth even when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.850" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">uncomfortable and for those people out</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.520" end="00:11:34.850" style="s2">there in the world engaged in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:37.490" style="s2">struggle with us realize you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.850" end="00:11:39.580" style="s2">alone and in today&#39;s world of digital</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.490" end="00:11:42.380" style="s2">media as this video is a great example</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.580" end="00:11:45.530" style="s2">we can find each other and we can share</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.380" end="00:11:49.430" style="s2">our stories with each other and that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.530" end="00:11:50.840" style="s2">itself is part of the solution so Martin</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.430" end="00:11:52.310" style="s2">thank you so much for taking the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.840" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">with this interview it&#39;s really a</p>
