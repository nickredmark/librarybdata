<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:04.960" style="s2">funny so john mentioned heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:06.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m really interested really really</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.960" end="00:00:08.480" style="s2">quite interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:09.760" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know why my mind jumped to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">so quickly but</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly chomping at the bit so</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">perhaps it is a good idea to run with it</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:18.080" style="s2">um though i have no particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.560" style="s2">attachment to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.080" end="00:00:21.920" style="s2">following that path at any pace perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s better to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.920" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">yeah totally i i uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">a couple things like yeah heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:33.439" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s a whole world</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:33.439" style="s2">like it&#39;s a whole world that&#39;s i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.719" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:41.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something that heidegger i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:43.360" style="s2">was um</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.870" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">haunted him that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:52.840" style="s2">that reveal the level of thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:54.160" style="s2">you could say the movement of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.840" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.160" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">right that i started to read</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">for reasons i don&#39;t quite understand at</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">the same time that circling</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">was emerging um because my back</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">my background is i don&#39;t have like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">not academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">yeah what just really quick that could</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">you say that another way</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">uh yeah or at all</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if i could paraphrase</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">that completely that was that was um</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">the dropping in of the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">what it would mean to be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">heidegger in the context of a group of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">people in a process that actually could</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">enable that group to have a collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">yeah yeah and what&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">this is what&#39;s telling</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">about i think revealing about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">the world like what heidegger was doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">is i didn&#39;t realize the connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">between the two until like two or three</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">years later</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">where because i didn&#39;t quite understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">why i was reading heidegger because i</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">understand him i mean i&#39;m dyslexic and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t learn how to read until i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">like 11 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">took a heroic teacher to kind of do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">for me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">so my reading comprehension is not like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i didn&#39;t quite understand why</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">i was reading the hardest philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">in like like known to man</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">but there was something about what he</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">was saying about being that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">um that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">to to attempt to understand him</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">what i what i realized was to was to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">to understand him and this is similar to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:33.760" style="s2">my experience of actually being mentored</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">or being with a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.760" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s this quality of um as roka</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">or as as uh verveiki would say a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">right participation in which like with</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">the mentor</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">when my grandfather who was a tailor who</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">was mentored for two years he lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">park in hanover germany when he would</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">talk about stories about being</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">dwelling with his mentor there was his</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">dwelling</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">quality where much of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">much of the learning wasn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">about what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">taylor said about tailoring</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">it was sitting next to him for hours at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">a time</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">right eating all of the sensibility in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">history of taylor hood and his way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">that um you kind of dwell in and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">you kind of come out</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">in some sense mentored fully through</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">right you kind of carry that way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">being right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">i would imagine it&#39;s similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">experience of when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">a another country and you come back home</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">and people tell you you have an accent</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s very much like that like for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">that&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">what heidegger says and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">what he says</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">and and when people summarize heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">there&#39;s positions and stuff he takes</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">really heidegger heidegger is taking you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">on this walk of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">right and the point is mostly this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s the experience of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">that is the thing i was most left with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">because though i would like you read</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">heidegger so you&#39;re like trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">in order to kind of understand what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">saying you have to step</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">so outside of your frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">right to then look</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">back and then kind of get it and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">just okay start all over again right</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">yeah and i would just do that hours and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">hours and hours and hours and then i go</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">and circle</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">and then i do that and i&#39;d circle and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">do that and i&#39;d circle and i do that i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">circle like this back and forth and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">one day</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">somebody said something that had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">vernacular</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">that was just the accent</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">of circling and it was i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">all of a sudden it hit me i&#39;m like very</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">fun very funny grandfather heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">oh i see this betty that what i realized</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">is he taught me actually how to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">um he taught me where like he taught me</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">that there&#39;s like you could say</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">sense is is this this awareness of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">concealment</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">is and that that that which is most</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">concealed is that which is most near</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">and that and that that kind of looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">of getting that sense of a horizon or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">talos</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">and also the background and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">foreground</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">and just having the sense of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">following that back</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">got kind of closer and closer and closer</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">in which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">in i would say encircling started to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">cultivate this deep sense of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">right about what i think the way that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">verveiki talks about is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">transframing this primordial ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">which when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">realize it there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">primordial sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">wonderment that comes up that is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">the very</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">experience of when you participate with</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">each other in that sense of wonderment</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">it seems to it seems to produce the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">that people call wonder and love</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">and affinity and unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">devotion and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">yeah um wow</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">well i&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">was running through my</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">way of making sense of what was what i</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">was perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">um was the sense or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">feeling of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">like a space-time okay okay i can say it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">um i had a real i had it inside a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">time ago where</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">i had realized if you take a look at a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">light at a lightning bolt</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">and from the perspective of a person</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">looking at a lightning bolt it looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">jaggedy but from the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">lightning bolt it&#39;s a perfectly straight</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">because we&#39;re looking at it from what</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">you might call a neutral third person</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">perspective through</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">space it&#39;s perceiving the galvanic</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">potential so it&#39;s proceeding along the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">the uh the gradient of galvanic</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">potential and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">is simply following the straightest path</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">through the gradient galvanic potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">yeah um so from its perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">traversing a straight line</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">yeah and then i was imagining the notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">of a circle</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">the circle ling but a circle and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">has a from a again objective</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">third-person space-time perspective i</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">can say that you&#39;re in a circle when</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">there are a group of people oriented</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">i would imagine in a uh all facing</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">inward</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">geometrically yeah all the same place at</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">the same time yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">yeah but then i was having this flash of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">when i was reading um manuel delanda</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">actually that book right there and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">it connected with</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">a conversation that i had been having in</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">my head of course with</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">je de louis and there was a flash of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">insight as the two connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">and i had this feeling of it being as if</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">we were in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">but mediated through</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">a phenomenology that has a different</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">frame of reference yeah that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">yeah it does can you say more about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">yeah oh man um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">well if we if we just zoom in on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">yeah and i can feel myself getting lost</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">so if i get lost please bring me back</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">um what what we can notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a very fun objective illusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">um in some sense this is as if we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">face to face</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">separated by a couple of feet yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">and yet of course if i notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">happening in reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">fact it&#39;s quite likely that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">the sound waves that are being projected</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">into my microphone electrically and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">converted into</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">digital signals inside my laptop</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">packeted</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">up in tcp packets and then spewed across</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">the internet</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">through the protocol that may in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">jumping through satellites into space</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">and back down</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">which then are emerged converted into</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">analog signals in your laptop</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">um the medium that enables that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">creates a so think about that like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">lightning bolt there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">objective perspective on our point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">view that collapses that entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">complexity of the underlying reality of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">what packet space would perceive as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">hell of a job</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">into something that is isomorphic to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">face-to-face conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">yeah right yeah so if i can run that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">same projection here and simulate a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">face-to-face conversation using a medium</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">you know a variety of different media</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">constructs i could do the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">and i could say oh well it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">the medium of capitalists and producing</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">books and shipping them to me via amazon</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">projecting text into my eyeball that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">glued to paper</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">i uh memetically copying the text that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">was actually scripted by</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">uh in this case de lloys and de landa</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">over a different time frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">same exact thing in reverse and so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">point of fact i am actually in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">with them but that circle is propagating</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">through reality in a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">way and if we can actually grok</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">the consequences of the media on the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">the consciousness is actually able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">form itself as a coherent singularity</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">then we&#39;re doing something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">hey i don&#39;t think i got lost i actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">pulled it off</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">you really did pull it off yeah totally</p>
