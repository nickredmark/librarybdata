<p begin="00:00:02.790" end="00:00:09.150" style="s2">transparency we are open sourcing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.819" end="00:00:10.920" style="s2">entire company and then the world a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:13.380" style="s2">of inefficiencies that exists in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.920" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">current system comes about due to a lack</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.380" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">of transparency our governments spend a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">lot of money and time coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">solutions and then they need to sell</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">those very solutions back to their</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">constituents because they were not</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">designed transparently corporations</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">safeguard their proprietary information</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">so the competition will not get it then</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">they must counteract this lack of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">transparency with expensive advertising</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">to offset some of the Trust&#39;s that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:39.030" style="s2">have lost our global cooperative is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">going to be as transparent as possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.030" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">as transparent as our current technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">allows as we create the technology to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">ever more transparent eventually all</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">information that is available to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:54.270" style="s2">Board of Directors will be available to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">every single member in an organized and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.270" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">easily understood way our finances will</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">be transparent that is where funding</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">comes from and where and how it is spent</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">will be available to all members during</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">and after our first crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">campaign this level of transparency</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">helps in many ways it makes us more</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">efficient more trustworthy and protects</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">us from many of the ways we could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">destroyed our for-profit competition</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.229" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">cannot be this transparent and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">cannot compete with our cooperative it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">makes us more efficient because ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">how to improve or mitigate risk can come</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">from anywhere and everywhere when we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">fail at anything we will have an open</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">and honest conversation and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.470" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">ideas on how to improve this in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:41.189" style="s2">future so it does not happen again for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">example if we have been in existence</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.189" end="00:01:45.390" style="s2">during the financial crash of 2008 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">some of our members were able to foresee</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.390" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">this issue and we did not listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">and so we had the negative effect from</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">the financial crash we could look back</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">with hindsight and ask why didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">listen to those exact people and is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">there a way to make sure those ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">listened to and and heard in the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">before the next financial crash or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">next bubble bursts mistakes made openly</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">lead to faster improvements we are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:12.310" style="s2">silencing dissent we are encouraging it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.310" end="00:02:18.489" style="s2">to make our entire system better this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:20.860" style="s2">what transparency does as a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.489" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">when we make mistakes we will have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.860" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">own them in full public view so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:27.550" style="s2">everyone can see what happened suggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:29.290" style="s2">why it happened and create a system to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.550" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">make it less likely to happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.290" end="00:02:33.730" style="s2">future to facilitate this we need an</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">internal culture that allows mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.730" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">and encourages learning from them we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:39.819" style="s2">going to fail in the right direction as</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:41.739" style="s2">we perfect the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.819" end="00:02:44.500" style="s2">spoiler alert there will never be</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.739" end="00:02:46.600" style="s2">perfect we are using full transparency</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:49.540" style="s2">internally but we are also creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.600" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">systems to create more transparency in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.540" end="00:02:53.830" style="s2">the external world as well as consumers</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:55.810" style="s2">we will demand transparency from</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.830" end="00:02:57.730" style="s2">companies we support and those that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.810" end="00:03:00.340" style="s2">cannot exist within this transparency</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.730" end="00:03:01.810" style="s2">will go out of business as voters we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.340" end="00:03:04.420" style="s2">will demand transparency from our</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.810" end="00:03:05.950" style="s2">politicians so we can better understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.420" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">the decisions they are making and why</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.950" end="00:03:09.610" style="s2">the only way to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:12.099" style="s2">transparency is to become more</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.610" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">transparent yourself if you cannot exist</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.099" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">in a system of transparency you will</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.100" style="s2">probably no longer exist when</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:20.590" style="s2">information is organized and made</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.100" end="00:03:22.900" style="s2">accessible to everyone a whole new level</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.590" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">of transparency is possible because when</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.900" end="00:03:28.870" style="s2">we see it as possible we will demand it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:30.880" style="s2">transparency neutralizes marketing you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.870" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">cannot create a brand that operates on</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.880" end="00:03:35.890" style="s2">spin of a product when we have access to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:37.329" style="s2">the truth it does not matter if you say</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.890" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">your product is environmentally-friendly</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.329" end="00:03:41.709" style="s2">and put on a green label because we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:44.739" style="s2">see the ingredients and track the record</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.709" end="00:03:47.260" style="s2">of the company and easily compare it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.739" end="00:03:49.540" style="s2">the other competing products corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.260" end="00:03:52.150" style="s2">politicians cannot remain in power when</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.540" end="00:03:54.549" style="s2">we can monitor their platform they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:56.889" style="s2">selected on and track the promises kept</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.549" end="00:04:00.130" style="s2">or broken when we create a system to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.889" end="00:04:02.440" style="s2">keep data on our politicians lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.130" end="00:04:06.690" style="s2">lose most of the power that was obtained</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.440" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">in secret pharmaceutical companies in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">the healthcare industry cannot get away</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.310" end="00:04:13.329" style="s2">with harming or poisoning us because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:15.250" style="s2">makes more profit than they have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.329" end="00:04:17.079" style="s2">out in lawsuits when we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">transparently see those lawsuits and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.079" end="00:04:21.729" style="s2">stand behind our fellow fellow consumers</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:24.550" style="s2">it becomes financially risky to be evil</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.729" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">in a transparent system we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.550" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">run our board of directors</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.130" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">corporations could mean somebody steals</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.789" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">as nobody can steal and recreate our</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:26.710" style="s2">idea in secret we can operate with full</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:28.450" style="s2">transparency because we are not in</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.450" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">but are in cooperation with each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:35.590" style="s2">Facebook cannot operate transparently so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:38.130" style="s2">that we can trust them and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.590" end="00:06:40.150" style="s2">they cannot recreate what we will create</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.130" end="00:06:42.690" style="s2">we however</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.150" end="00:06:45.010" style="s2">and reproduce a facebook like platform</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.690" end="00:06:47.200" style="s2">that we designed for the purpose of</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.490" end="00:06:56.890" style="s2">happens if somebody does it first what</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:59.170" style="s2">do we do if a different company creates</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.420" end="00:07:05.200" style="s2">everybody is invited and we solve</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.420" end="00:07:14.830" style="s2">even our competition isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.460" end="00:07:17.170" style="s2">competition because the design fixes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.830" end="00:07:19.750" style="s2">the only people who would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.170" end="00:07:22.150" style="s2">competition are people doing the exact</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.750" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">same thing in which case we join them</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.150" end="00:07:26.980" style="s2">just like they could join us the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:29.230" style="s2">not to have transparency is to hide</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.980" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">something from your members customers</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.230" end="00:07:33.490" style="s2">shareholders or the government we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:36.460" style="s2">nothing to hide so the outside forces</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.490" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">cannot create spin about what we could</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.460" end="00:07:43.420" style="s2">be up to because we are doing it in full</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">view for everyone to see full</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.420" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">transparency helps us problem-solve more</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.490" end="00:07:50.230" style="s2">efficiently the Board of Directors is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">acting as the greater memberships proxy</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.230" end="00:07:54.730" style="s2">for instance if the Board of Directors</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:56.890" style="s2">makes a budget and then goes over it it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.730" end="00:07:58.930" style="s2">is not only the Board of Directors that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.890" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">are responsible as every single member</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.930" end="00:08:03.000" style="s2">had access to the budget and could have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">improved it if they had better ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.000" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">because of this it is a lot easier to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">back to the membership and ask for more</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.600" style="s2">money since we all went over-budget</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:12.910" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.600" end="00:08:14.710" style="s2">similarly if there is a legal</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.910" end="00:08:17.620" style="s2">ramification from a decision that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.710" end="00:08:19.330" style="s2">made we are all equally liable if our</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.620" end="00:08:21.670" style="s2">data is breached in a way that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:23.650" style="s2">foresaw or in a way that we deemed it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.670" end="00:08:26.140" style="s2">was an allowable risk then we are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.650" end="00:08:27.550" style="s2">equally liable this does not mean we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.140" end="00:08:29.230" style="s2">not make these issues right when</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.550" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">mistakes happen it means that they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.230" end="00:08:33.220" style="s2">less likely to occur and when they do</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:35.950" style="s2">they are less likely to have a large</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.220" end="00:08:38.020" style="s2">settlement amount attached to them it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.950" end="00:08:39.390" style="s2">like the difference between suing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.020" end="00:08:41.650" style="s2">restaurant that gave you food poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.390" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2">versus suing a friend who cooked you</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.650" end="00:08:45.340" style="s2">dinner and gave you food poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:48.040" style="s2">the former is expected and the latter</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.340" end="00:08:51.280" style="s2">makes you a bad friend we take the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.040" end="00:08:52.610" style="s2">entire risk together transparency is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.280" end="00:08:54.860" style="s2">key to this revolution</p>
