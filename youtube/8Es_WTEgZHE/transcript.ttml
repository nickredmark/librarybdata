<p begin="00:02:41.209" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">to this space is it&#39;s starting to bubble</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.910" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2">up but it feels like a wildly unstable</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">element and it&#39;s breaking my heart /</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.160" end="00:02:53.810" style="s2">freaking me out</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not concerning me that we our</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">be going so badly so far and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:06.739" style="s2">deeply committed to figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.530" end="00:03:10.310" style="s2">are the rate limiters / Achilles heels</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.739" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">missing links that can help us at least</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">better different mistakes because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.170" end="00:03:20.300" style="s2">feels like our efforts right now are</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:23.989" style="s2">actually just the last half century red</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:25.930" style="s2">ducks with very little go forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.989" end="00:03:28.760" style="s2">learning happening so it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.930" end="00:03:32.620" style="s2">transformational culture is basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.760" end="00:03:36.440" style="s2">just repeating the baby boomer hippie</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.620" end="00:03:38.209" style="s2">new-age traps and just running into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.440" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">running off the roads at exactly all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.209" end="00:03:42.110" style="s2">same places there&#39;s already the skid</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.110" end="00:03:49.610" style="s2">find incredibly valuable on what are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.850" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">big systemic issues what are other ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.610" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">to think of this and how do we help give</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">more people in your terms the generator</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:02.360" style="s2">functions to keep figuring this up</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">together and make newer better more</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:06.820" style="s2">suspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:11.860" style="s2">there is just not the same hole I heard</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.820" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">ridiculous I mean my my patter I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.860" end="00:04:16.540" style="s2">is the in fact it may be identical but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:18.700" style="s2">my experience of it of the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.540" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">even describe is very first person which</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.700" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">is that my path here is through a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">very large number of distinct personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">failures like just running into a wall</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:29.260" style="s2">and going okay well that&#39;s wrong turning</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">a little bit bring into another wall</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.260" end="00:04:32.650" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong turning a little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:36.010" style="s2">into another wall ik the number of times</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.650" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">that I have up is insane like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.010" end="00:04:44.230" style="s2">came in like thousands if not tens of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:46.450" style="s2">thousands it&#39;s crazy and in the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.230" end="00:04:48.250" style="s2">of that for example this is a good case</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.450" end="00:04:49.480" style="s2">study one of the things they ended up</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.250" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">getting a hold it was the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.480" end="00:04:52.660" style="s2">you could actually do things when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:55.090" style="s2">could imagine what the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.660" end="00:04:57.100" style="s2">your actions might be quite a distance</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.090" end="00:04:58.930" style="s2">down the road and you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.100" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">really really good at that to the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.930" end="00:05:02.380" style="s2">you could actually sit there and hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">someone to describe a plan to you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.380" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">you could listen to the plan and go that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">won&#39;t work right and be very confident</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:11.020" style="s2">that in fact that plan is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">plan I mean an example might be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.020" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">going to walk up to the fireplace and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.390" style="s2">point my hands I didn&#39;t say light I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">say well you know that&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.390" end="00:05:19.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a good model of how reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:21.700" style="s2">works I&#39;ve done this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.390" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">before bad plan alright so what I found</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.700" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">though was that as I absorb more and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:27.669" style="s2">more life experience and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:30.040" style="s2">knowledge I began to be noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.669" end="00:05:32.290" style="s2">more and more often more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.040" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">people&#39;s plans were of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.290" end="00:05:35.740" style="s2">and that was like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:37.930" style="s2">interesting so I took that as an object</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.740" end="00:05:41.320" style="s2">of inquiry and by the way again my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.930" end="00:05:43.060" style="s2">being first and foremost so okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.320" end="00:05:45.430" style="s2">long-term planning is not working out so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.060" end="00:05:48.820" style="s2">I got you know kept going okay how can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.430" end="00:05:50.260" style="s2">you actually make effective choices how</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.820" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">can you actually plan at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.260" end="00:05:54.940" style="s2">about what&#39;s gonna happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">and what I began to notice was the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.940" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about like everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:02.770" style="s2">that we currently believe that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.030" style="s2">plan won&#39;t work like none of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:06.070" style="s2">that we have in our tool kit that allows</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.030" end="00:06:07.900" style="s2">us to make plans for the future is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.070" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">work out fill in the blank like pick any</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.900" end="00:06:10.540" style="s2">problem I kept running the situations</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:13.000" style="s2">when people describe a particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.540" end="00:06:15.010" style="s2">problem everything we&#39;re gonna solve</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.000" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">climate we&#39;re gonna solve conflict we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.010" end="00:06:17.780" style="s2">gonna solve education</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:19.190" style="s2">just listen to them talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.780" end="00:06:20.810" style="s2">plan and go well that&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.190" end="00:06:23.660" style="s2">only is that not gonna work it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.810" end="00:06:25.340" style="s2">work like terribly what&#39;s happening so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.660" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">this led me to then finally looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">it okay what might and then that began</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:32.630" style="s2">the process of saying okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">actually get to the point we can begin</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.630" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">to get some level of clarity on what</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:47.180" style="s2">might actually be a meaningful step and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:49.400" style="s2">that leads me here that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.180" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">answer to that question the answer of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.400" end="00:06:55.910" style="s2">recognizing that the question of sense</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:04.840" style="s2">was really effective and that blew all</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.250" end="00:09:11.709" style="s2">so a rock Harare posits basically he</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.010" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">game a this is all right how do I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.710" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">solved the problem of scale while</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.410" style="s2">working together and this is the three</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.410" end="00:09:44.010" style="s2">something where the group is effectively</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.490" end="00:09:50.460" style="s2">from the inside how do I avoid</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.460" end="00:09:55.710" style="s2">that and how do I actually create enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.590" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">power inside that that group that it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.710" end="00:09:58.920" style="s2">actually compete now with other groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">now of course we had the whole story of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.920" end="00:10:02.340" style="s2">game a playing out over time the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:05.060" style="s2">solution the game a comes up with is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.340" end="00:10:07.350" style="s2">this entire store there&#39;s society mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.060" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">paradigms so think of it as like a most</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.350" end="00:10:11.640" style="s2">computational actuation that simplifies</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">human relationships and puts them in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:16.280" style="s2">very simple relationships to have inputs</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:18.690" style="s2">and outputs formal structures money law</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.280" end="00:10:20.010" style="s2">anything that can fit in a semantic</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.690" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">narrative the actually have been really</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:23.520" style="s2">held by a person in teaching if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">written down in a book and repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.520" end="00:10:26.070" style="s2">over and over again it&#39;s simplified</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:28.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to it but I want to mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.070" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t have forever so then we fast</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:32.430" style="s2">forward it&#39;s okay game a has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:35.070" style="s2">bunch of things inside as possibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.430" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">space so it can we deliver on the Ming</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.070" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">Dynasty and Rome and the Prussians and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:42.450" style="s2">21st century us sorry these are all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:44.030" style="s2">inside the thing the game they can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.450" end="00:10:47.580" style="s2">but they&#39;re all variations on that theme</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.030" end="00:10:48.960" style="s2">we come to where we are now the problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.580" end="00:10:50.370" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing or a different set of</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.370" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2">into now is that game a in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.480" end="00:11:00.210" style="s2">can&#39;t ultimately deal with complexity</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:38.970" style="s2">precisely because it is so effective at</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.880" end="00:11:56.170" style="s2">right so a game a runs to the limits of</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.580" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">game B just literally we&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.340" end="00:12:12.610" style="s2">is that the first thing is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.020" end="00:12:13.690" style="s2">why we can name it game B is to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.610" end="00:12:15.850" style="s2">what&#39;s something that is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.690" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">different game altogether all right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.850" end="00:12:20.200" style="s2">go over to the basis it&#39;s something on</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:24.970" style="s2">the order of magnitude of the difference</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.410" end="00:12:35.110" style="s2">then that whole box is different right</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.740" end="00:12:36.520" style="s2">that order of magnitude and it has</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">characteristics that allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.520" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">actually actually address these three</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.670" end="00:13:00.760" style="s2">questioning of this over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.320" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">over again it recognized for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.760" end="00:13:03.940" style="s2">that you have to change the mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">otherwise you just recapitulate this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.940" end="00:13:09.880" style="s2">society is this thing we&#39;ve been calling</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:11.980" style="s2">coherent collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.880" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">coherence specifically is that the very</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.980" end="00:13:18.640" style="s2">center of it but in many ways game be</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">even talked about has a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.640" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">Taoist sense to it as you&#39;re naming it</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:26.650" style="s2">in the context of game a quite often</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:28.060" style="s2">you&#39;re actually importing gaming into it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.650" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">so you have to actually treat it very</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.060" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">very carefully it&#39;s less about being</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:34.330" style="s2">able to describe it than it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:36.340" style="s2">just being able to do it it is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.330" end="00:13:38.680" style="s2">of thing that you do not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.340" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">thing you talk about you can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.680" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">how you can become capable of it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:44.710" style="s2">designing it talking about it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:45.490" style="s2">generally a full fundamental error that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.710" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">does that make sense what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.490" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.520" end="00:13:57.160" style="s2">I mean I think just depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.850" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">taoist we imagine game B to be well</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.160" end="00:14:00.910" style="s2">that&#39;s very odd because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:03.220" style="s2">actually be Taoist interesting enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.910" end="00:14:05.170" style="s2">but it can actually be it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.220" end="00:14:07.960" style="s2">the Taoist insight that points to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.170" end="00:14:09.670" style="s2">Dao I can say very clearly if I could</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.960" end="00:14:12.040" style="s2">articulate it my definition is</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.670" end="00:14:13.570" style="s2">complicated it&#39;s not complicated game B</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.040" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">is not complicated game B must be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.570" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">intrinsically complex so I cannot define</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">it in any finite set of statements</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:25.180" style="s2">because any finite set of statements</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:27.460" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated so it&#39;s not that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.180" end="00:14:29.560" style="s2">of thing so if I&#39;m explaining as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.460" end="00:14:31.660" style="s2">describing it I have to be doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.560" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">something which is essentially poetic</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.660" end="00:14:36.430" style="s2">not a specification or where as daniel</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.290" style="s2">said I&#39;m pointing towards the generator</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.430" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">functions they give rise to something</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.290" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">that is more than the thing that is said</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.320" end="00:14:51.910" style="s2">noticing three distinct things to come</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.520" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">up one is the question of why why did</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.910" end="00:14:56.730" style="s2">this thing which I&#39;ll just call</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:15:05.460" style="s2">coherence that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.730" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">the the second is why does it thus far</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.460" end="00:15:16.450" style="s2">fail to scale and then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:18.640" style="s2">third is how might we do about solving</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.450" end="00:15:21.520" style="s2">that problem all three seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.640" end="00:15:24.430" style="s2">showing up close to each other in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.520" end="00:15:26.950" style="s2">sense do you want to share more what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.430" end="00:15:31.000" style="s2">mean by coherence all right immediately</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.950" end="00:15:32.440" style="s2">what comes up so what is this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.000" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.440" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">talking about it but we might say</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">there&#39;s ah actually interesting it seems</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.460" style="s2">like you actually have to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:45.960" style="s2">in many different ways because it is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.460" end="00:15:50.830" style="s2">kind of thing that cannot be conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.960" end="00:15:53.320" style="s2">effectively in language you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.830" end="00:15:56.140" style="s2">the matrix unfortunately no one can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.320" end="00:15:57.550" style="s2">told what coherence is but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.140" end="00:16:00.130" style="s2">actually tell a lot of different stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.550" end="00:16:02.019" style="s2">it&#39;s become the blonde with the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.130" end="00:16:04.209" style="s2">and after a little while we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.019" end="00:16:06.819" style="s2">might be able to in ourselves grass</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.209" end="00:16:15.939" style="s2">perhaps what is being pointed out so one</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.819" end="00:16:18.879" style="s2">way of describing it is it is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.939" end="00:16:27.389" style="s2">form of collective intelligence that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.879" end="00:16:34.889" style="s2">as a characteristic a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.389" end="00:16:42.489" style="s2">capacity in the space of novelty and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.889" end="00:16:45.639" style="s2">intrinsic antifragility in both human</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.489" end="00:16:51.929" style="s2">and throw Powe complexity and nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.639" end="00:16:54.759" style="s2">complexity another way of saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.929" end="00:16:55.989" style="s2">if you work backwards in taking a look</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.759" end="00:16:59.709" style="s2">at all the different challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.989" end="00:17:04.870" style="s2">problems that we are currently facing we</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.709" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">meaning humanity is the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.870" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">set that contains those problems another</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:18.510" style="s2">way of describing it is it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:22.439" style="s2">like flow since we have that as a nice</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.510" end="00:17:29.320" style="s2">concrete frame then we can invoke that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.439" end="00:17:31.029" style="s2">in an unconstrained way ie we oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.320" end="00:17:33.309" style="s2">associate with flow with flow in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.029" end="00:17:36.639" style="s2">domain a rock-climber isn&#39;t flowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.309" end="00:17:42.059" style="s2">climbing rocks a jazz band isn&#39;t flow</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.639" end="00:17:45.250" style="s2">and playing jazz coherence is flow</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.059" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">absent context absent a particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.250" end="00:17:52.919" style="s2">application you know so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">mentioned he said it has a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.919" end="00:17:59.910" style="s2">with novelty what prompts you to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:02.309" style="s2">that into the mix because if I just hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.910" end="00:18:04.110" style="s2">the word coherent so that just feels let</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.309" end="00:18:06.150" style="s2">you know from physics electronics</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.110" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">whatever it would just be things in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.150" end="00:18:12.419" style="s2">form of sync with each other but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">added in novelty and antifragility the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.419" end="00:18:16.140" style="s2">brothers have seemed interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">they&#39;re not what I would have just</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.140" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2">expected to come from the word so can</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.140" end="00:18:28.169" style="s2">you help unpack either the Y or the how</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.700" end="00:18:30.750" style="s2">you got to those yeah I think also to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.169" end="00:18:33.860" style="s2">begin it&#39;s I think what you bring up is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.750" end="00:18:35.640" style="s2">good we should just say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">different kinds of collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.640" end="00:18:41.429" style="s2">intelligence and some kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:42.630" style="s2">collective intelligence we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.429" end="00:18:44.010" style="s2">different names for with my call them</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.630" end="00:18:47.250" style="s2">different things so in this context</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.010" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to be very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.250" end="00:18:51.690" style="s2">with the notion that word choice is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:54.750" style="s2">oftentimes going to require some careful</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:55.890" style="s2">definition as you just did so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.750" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">for everyone who&#39;s listening just</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.890" end="00:19:00.030" style="s2">recognize that oftentimes I have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:01.710" style="s2">certain vocabulary daniel has vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.030" end="00:19:03.750" style="s2">you have a vocabulary we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.710" end="00:19:06.600" style="s2">operating under what I&#39;ve called rule</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.750" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">Omega which is listen to what is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.600" end="00:19:10.710" style="s2">expressed not what is being said and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">asked good questions until what is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.710" end="00:19:15.630" style="s2">expressed has actually felt it&#39;s landed</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">so if we think about the examples of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.630" end="00:19:21.299" style="s2">flow you&#39;ve provided so well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:23.549" style="s2">things that shows up so commonly is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.299" end="00:19:26.820" style="s2">sense of there being an emergence or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.549" end="00:19:28.710" style="s2">synergy where there&#39;s something about a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:32.460" style="s2">hole that is greater than the sum of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.710" end="00:19:39.710" style="s2">parts and that as it turns out happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.460" end="00:19:39.710" style="s2">to be the best way to respond to novelty</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.150" end="00:19:47.030" style="s2">let me add some words that I think might</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.020" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">add clarity to a question I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.030" end="00:19:54.460" style="s2">asking we&#39;ve discussed offline some</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:57.530" style="s2">different types of coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.460" end="00:19:59.240" style="s2">different contexts and like formal</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.530" end="00:20:01.850" style="s2">models for looking at what coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.240" end="00:20:04.160" style="s2">different contexts means and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.850" end="00:20:04.790" style="s2">mention like physics like things of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.160" end="00:20:07.930" style="s2">same type</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.790" end="00:20:11.030" style="s2">like pendulums or lasers that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.930" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">coherence of sameness they all become</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.030" end="00:20:16.940" style="s2">the same wavelength</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:19.190" style="s2">they have the same periodicity and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.940" end="00:20:22.210" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about humans being able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.190" end="00:20:26.690" style="s2">come into coherence we&#39;re not wanting a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.210" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">homogenizing coherence and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.690" end="00:20:31.580" style="s2">about something like a body liver cells</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.940" end="00:20:33.680" style="s2">and neurons and fat cells are all very</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.580" end="00:20:35.630" style="s2">different types of cells and yet they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.680" end="00:20:38.060" style="s2">operating in a way where the body is an</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.630" end="00:20:39.800" style="s2">emergent property that has capacities</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.060" end="00:20:42.410" style="s2">that none of the cells or organs or</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.800" end="00:20:44.090" style="s2">subsystems they can separately have so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.410" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a coherence of different things</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.090" end="00:20:48.470" style="s2">where the difference is the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:52.430" style="s2">synergy rather than being the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.470" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">an unreconciled or conflict the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.430" end="00:20:57.800" style="s2">difference is a basis for synergy where</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.880" end="00:20:59.150" style="s2">each of them have capacity separately</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.800" end="00:21:01.010" style="s2">and then the whole has capacities</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.150" end="00:21:05.270" style="s2">neither of them have that are found in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.010" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">each of them plus the relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.270" end="00:21:09.680" style="s2">opposed to the differences being a basis</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">for unreconciled will conflict so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.680" end="00:21:16.310" style="s2">interested here in the types of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:17.980" style="s2">coherence that can occur where there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.310" end="00:21:20.840" style="s2">differences right differences of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">experience differences of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.840" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">and yet like so I&#39;ll just tie a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">other words together Jordan said he said</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:30.500" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like flow if we think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:33.130" style="s2">flow from fluid dynamics in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.500" end="00:21:37.010" style="s2">like laminar flow versus turbulent flow</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.130" end="00:21:38.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a more flow is less entropy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.010" end="00:21:42.140" style="s2">actually not just less entropy buts</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.990" end="00:21:44.330" style="s2">entropy the movement towards holes that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.140" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">have greater than some of the parts and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.330" end="00:21:48.020" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.980" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2">interested in collective sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.020" end="00:21:53.750" style="s2">how do we come together in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">that has less friction less entropy</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.750" end="00:22:00.230" style="s2">relationally Moore&#39;s entropy where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:01.820" style="s2">group of us has capacities has emergent</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.230" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">properties that aren&#39;t found in any of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.820" end="00:22:08.870" style="s2">us in isolation the coherence is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">phenomena that emergent properties arise</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.870" end="00:22:14.150" style="s2">from right and then so the the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:19.790" style="s2">distinction was we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.150" end="00:22:21.950" style="s2">examples of this kind that have no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.790" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">actually gonna get pretty nuanced so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.950" end="00:22:24.860" style="s2">may as well just be careful about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:27.080" style="s2">were getting nuanced we have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.860" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">particular kind of coherence I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:32.210" style="s2">gonna label coordination just we have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:34.220" style="s2">label for it and this has a lot of weird</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.210" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">Angels talking about in fact it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.220" end="00:22:39.559" style="s2">emergent properties so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a mathematician having a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.559" end="00:22:46.700" style="s2">conversation with an economist there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:47.750" style="s2">in fact a hole in their conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.700" end="00:22:50.059" style="s2">that is greater than the sum of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.750" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">parts there&#39;s there&#39;s a connection</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.059" end="00:22:53.960" style="s2">between those two ways of thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">toolkits of mathematics that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.960" end="00:22:56.540" style="s2">available as the economist unlocks</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">things the economist wouldn&#39;t have known</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.540" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">about but for example the economists</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.880" style="s2">questions that weren&#39;t things the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:03.169" style="s2">mathematician was thinking about unlocks</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.880" end="00:23:05.419" style="s2">things the mathematician wasn&#39;t thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.169" end="00:23:09.380" style="s2">about right so there&#39;s a synergy value</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.419" end="00:23:10.910" style="s2">to that that&#39;s also not the thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.380" end="00:23:14.299" style="s2">talking about that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.910" end="00:23:16.600" style="s2">really good useful but for very specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.299" end="00:23:20.140" style="s2">reasons which we can go to if we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.600" end="00:23:27.020" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.140" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">to satisfy the requirements of call it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.020" end="00:23:30.110" style="s2">the problems that we&#39;re facing Kant said</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.390" style="s2">if I just satisfy the problems of nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.110" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">natural complexity it can&#39;t satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.390" end="00:23:36.160" style="s2">problems event ropo complexity one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:38.090" style="s2">which is why it keeps breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.160" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">every time you try to build something</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:41.630" style="s2">like this an trope of complexity often</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:45.590" style="s2">times it becomes the primary reason why</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.630" end="00:23:48.020" style="s2">it breaks down yeah I mean it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.590" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">if I&#39;m hearing right the question is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.020" end="00:23:54.820" style="s2">just how how can we get together with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:58.900" style="s2">each other in a way that leaves us</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:24:02.230" style="s2">smarter kind of more creative more</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.900" end="00:24:08.739" style="s2">courageous more resilient</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.230" end="00:24:13.299" style="s2">than any of us are a part and me at</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.739" end="00:24:14.980" style="s2">least as far as terms for me flow is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.299" end="00:24:16.929" style="s2">often a bit of a buzzword and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.980" end="00:24:18.279" style="s2">lot of people project onto it but some</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.929" end="00:24:20.289" style="s2">slightly more precise like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.279" end="00:24:21.789" style="s2">thinking of examples and you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.289" end="00:24:25.299" style="s2">if I&#39;m barking up the right tree or not</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.789" end="00:24:27.639" style="s2">but like examples I think of is Victor</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.299" end="00:24:29.980" style="s2">Turner&#39;s notion at University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.639" end="00:24:31.539" style="s2">community toss which is a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.980" end="00:24:35.739" style="s2">simply a collection it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.539" end="00:24:39.129" style="s2">crowd or a mom it&#39;s a felt presence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.739" end="00:24:41.649" style="s2">coherence among a group and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.129" end="00:24:43.539" style="s2">think about like Quakers use the term a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.649" end="00:24:44.769" style="s2">gathered meeting there&#39;s a regular</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.539" end="00:24:47.529" style="s2">meeting we all shuffle into the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.769" end="00:24:49.269" style="s2">house no one says much and and people or</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.529" end="00:24:50.859" style="s2">even people may say a few things and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.269" end="00:24:52.210" style="s2">that can not be a gathered meeting</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.859" end="00:24:54.009" style="s2">that&#39;s just a physical collection of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.210" end="00:24:57.009" style="s2">humans on a Sunday morning but a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.009" end="00:25:00.429" style="s2">gathered meeting is there you know over</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.009" end="00:25:03.070" style="s2">centuries of really delicate listening</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.429" end="00:25:07.539" style="s2">into that is that place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.070" end="00:25:08.830" style="s2">speaking only when spoken through and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.539" end="00:25:10.600" style="s2">that the collective intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.830" end="00:25:13.779" style="s2">given voice through a given individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.600" end="00:25:18.429" style="s2">but it&#39;s clearly not just their thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.779" end="00:25:20.379" style="s2">ideas or words does that try yes for you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.429" end="00:25:24.100" style="s2">guys okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.379" end="00:25:25.960" style="s2">now I know obviously analogies of humans</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:27.220" style="s2">and brains and minds to computers are</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.960" end="00:25:28.899" style="s2">obviously problematic and a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.220" end="00:25:31.419" style="s2">of different levels but as far as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.899" end="00:25:34.090" style="s2">simple one does this also seem to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.419" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">notion of connecting CPUs or computers</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.090" end="00:25:40.090" style="s2">in serial such that the connected</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:41.559" style="s2">computational power and capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.090" end="00:25:42.879" style="s2">greater than any of the things in</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.559" end="00:25:45.100" style="s2">between and that they might actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.879" end="00:25:47.980" style="s2">even be able to tackle problems that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.100" end="00:25:53.049" style="s2">any individual computer would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.980" end="00:25:54.940" style="s2">uncapable of solving actually no and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.049" end="00:25:58.119" style="s2">that goes back to the in addition of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.940" end="00:26:00.730" style="s2">coordination so that style of connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.119" end="00:26:03.539" style="s2">is coordination and it does have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.730" end="00:26:05.830" style="s2">characteristic of increasing capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.539" end="00:26:08.549" style="s2">and in fact increasing capacity in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.830" end="00:26:08.549" style="s2">fashion that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.390" end="00:26:14.650" style="s2">well at least depending on the specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.250" end="00:26:17.500" style="s2">kind of problem and the physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.650" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">capacity to do compute often times it</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:20.890" style="s2">better to polish if you&#39;re solving</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:24.190" style="s2">particular kinds of problems that make</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.890" end="00:26:25.480" style="s2">sense so much of sin it doesn&#39;t I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.620" end="00:26:35.410" style="s2">but if we connected up enough of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.150" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">together we can actually project a</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.420" end="00:27:25.540" style="s2">analysis perhaps but the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.860" end="00:27:26.950" style="s2">third they talked about in like dyadic</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.540" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">relationships and sometimes they&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:32.350" style="s2">do couples therapy whether it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:34.060" style="s2">like you know a plate for Elijah or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.350" end="00:27:36.250" style="s2">know like you see for Elvis it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.060" end="00:27:39.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the third and the third is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.250" end="00:27:41.590" style="s2">intelligence of the relationship and is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.400" end="00:27:44.470" style="s2">the third you know a working place the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.590" end="00:27:47.500" style="s2">idea that there is between an among us</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.470" end="00:27:51.190" style="s2">but not specific to any of us an</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.500" end="00:27:53.890" style="s2">additional intelligence that can emerge</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.190" end="00:27:56.170" style="s2">and that is that that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.890" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">differentiator between what you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.170" end="00:28:00.670" style="s2">describing is coherence and simply maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:03.130" style="s2">collective intelligence or proper</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.670" end="00:28:08.800" style="s2">coordination your coordination yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.130" end="00:28:12.700" style="s2">very I&#39;m gonna say yes okay yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.800" end="00:28:14.710" style="s2">I&#39;m wanting to translate different</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:18.190" style="s2">ontology listeners might be coming from</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.710" end="00:28:19.300" style="s2">and say there&#39;s a couple at least a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.190" end="00:28:21.240" style="s2">couple different ways we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.300" end="00:28:26.970" style="s2">this both of which are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.240" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s a question of can we come</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.970" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">into a type of relationship as beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">where there is a kind of synergy a kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:38.250" style="s2">of coherence where there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:41.490" style="s2">emergent property of something antek</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.250" end="00:28:43.890" style="s2">that then has a top-down effect in us we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.490" end="00:28:45.510" style="s2">can actually listen to that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.890" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">some interesting kind of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.510" end="00:28:50.549" style="s2">propositions that would make that be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:53.730" style="s2">case and I would say that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.549" end="00:28:58.110" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also the well if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.730" end="00:29:00.570" style="s2">not true and mine is still processing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">separate brains is there still something</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.570" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">we&#39;re intending to listen in to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">group as opposed to just myself and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:15.240" style="s2">having the intention to consider the</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.179" end="00:29:46.470" style="s2">or problematic to consider so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.940" end="00:29:51.630" style="s2">what you just said which is let&#39;s call</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.740" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">right if we&#39;re talking about post</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:31:04.400" style="s2">rational coherence is there a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:06.770" style="s2">is super ordinate to us if so is that</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.770" end="00:31:09.050" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.280" end="00:31:11.680" style="s2">all right we&#39;re landing the mothership</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">or is it problematic because it creates</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.680" end="00:31:16.130" style="s2">magical thinking projections and other</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:17.510" style="s2">stuff well interestingly I think we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.130" end="00:31:23.030" style="s2">actually have a nice self referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.510" end="00:31:24.410" style="s2">that just happens right here because so</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.030" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">the first step might be something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.410" end="00:31:28.280" style="s2">something I call a paradigm mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:30.110" style="s2">Daniel actually did paradigm that many</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.280" end="00:31:32.650" style="s2">moment ago so you take a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.110" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">story that somebody&#39;s telling and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.650" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">point by point map it to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:40.160" style="s2">paradigm so I could describe that in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">terms of cognitive science and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.160" end="00:31:45.230" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:48.560" style="s2">create a proposition that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.230" end="00:31:50.540" style="s2">third what this does in our own minds is</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.560" end="00:31:52.310" style="s2">that it allows us to no longer have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.540" end="00:31:54.410" style="s2">emotional attachment to the rightness or</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.310" end="00:31:56.930" style="s2">the wrongness a particular idea which</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.410" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">gives rise to a cognitive capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.930" end="00:32:01.820" style="s2">more creative more fluid in explorations</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:04.790" style="s2">and therefore is a more generative way</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.820" end="00:32:06.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a form of hack that allows</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.790" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">us to have that cognitive disposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.770" end="00:32:11.240" style="s2">right so I just did a mapping to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:13.190" style="s2">of language in cognitive science that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.240" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">would take somebody who loads and runs</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.190" end="00:32:17.000" style="s2">cognitive science as a sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:19.010" style="s2">framework and make them go okay that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.000" end="00:32:20.450" style="s2">makes sense feels good my I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.010" end="00:32:21.920" style="s2">scared or angry about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.450" end="00:32:25.550" style="s2">right now that feels like a feasible</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.920" end="00:32:28.310" style="s2">thing but of course the meta proposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.550" end="00:32:33.350" style="s2">is that mapping it to a paradigm full</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.310" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">stop at all is the problem so anytime</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.350" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">you&#39;re actually trying to make sense by</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:40.610" style="s2">mapping to a paradigm whether the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">paradigm is a you know Vishnu or the God</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.610" end="00:32:47.480" style="s2">pan or cognitive neuroscience or</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:48.610" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re already recapturing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.480" end="00:32:53.400" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.610" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">in a particular way of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.400" end="00:32:59.170" style="s2">limits its capacity to be the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:02.830" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to actually do so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.170" end="00:33:03.850" style="s2">answer to the question is like if the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.830" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">answer the question like the classic</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.850" end="00:33:07.270" style="s2">Buddhists just whack you in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.590" style="s2">the head like that&#39;s the only real</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.270" end="00:33:11.140" style="s2">response to that kind of a question is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.590" end="00:33:14.740" style="s2">don&#39;t go that direction</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.140" end="00:33:19.299" style="s2">sure okay so so yes and then but he so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.740" end="00:33:22.299" style="s2">if coherence is this ephemeral emergent</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.299" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">property the best never named the never</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.299" end="00:33:27.490" style="s2">subject to reality captured reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">tunnel capture like it&#39;s that thing then</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.490" end="00:33:31.780" style="s2">how the hell do skill it cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.530" end="00:33:34.179" style="s2">storytelling monkeys and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.780" end="00:33:35.380" style="s2">we need recipes to help the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.179" end="00:33:37.809" style="s2">propagate so this good unless</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.380" end="00:33:39.730" style="s2">everybody&#39;s job Yodas then why does it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.809" end="00:33:40.690" style="s2">always break down mm-hmm why do why are</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.730" end="00:33:44.710" style="s2">we to meet we just go doesn&#39;t break down</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.690" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2">one of the reasons is because as our</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.710" end="00:33:49.960" style="s2">friend Lao Tzu discovered and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:52.510" style="s2">also a friend Buddha discovered enter</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.960" end="00:33:54.220" style="s2">friend Jesus discovered every time the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.510" end="00:33:56.200" style="s2">storytelling monkeys try to turn to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.220" end="00:33:58.950" style="s2">story to tell they it up</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.200" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">so let&#39;s be mindful of that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:03.660" style="s2">recognize that the storytelling piece of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:07.690" style="s2">it definitely isn&#39;t the answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.660" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">okay so Sherlock Holmes style now carve</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.690" end="00:34:11.560" style="s2">that out of the available portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:12.850" style="s2">things that we can do how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.560" end="00:34:14.950" style="s2">doing anything at all that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:12.420" style="s2">we&#39;re back to trying to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.570" end="00:35:14.040" style="s2">in the prison-house of language telling</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.420" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">stories and making analogies or</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.040" end="00:35:16.920" style="s2">metaphors so let&#39;s take a distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:20.849" style="s2">think we this distinction I think is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.920" end="00:35:25.260" style="s2">quite helpful there&#39;s at least two</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.849" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">distinct uses of language this one over</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.260" end="00:35:31.859" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:34.950" style="s2">I&#39;ll call semantic reality mapping this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.859" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2">is really good for things like building</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.950" end="00:35:42.089" style="s2">houses or putting together battle plans</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.660" end="00:35:45.290" style="s2">it Orient&#39;s coordinated behavior where</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.089" end="00:35:47.220" style="s2">the checksum of reality is pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.290" end="00:35:50.010" style="s2">science does a lot of this science is</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.220" end="00:35:55.290" style="s2">pretty much this kind of thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.010" end="00:35:57.060" style="s2">is poetry parable where the fingers</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.290" end="00:36:00.290" style="s2">pointing to the moon and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.060" end="00:36:02.220" style="s2">the moon not the finger this we can use</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.290" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">we&#39;re just to be very careful that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.220" end="00:36:05.730" style="s2">not doing this so the problem that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">think happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.730" end="00:36:09.329" style="s2">particular with the folks that wear lots</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:12.599" style="s2">of feathers and like to take too many</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.329" end="00:36:14.490" style="s2">drugs is they do this so they have an</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.599" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">experience and then try to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.490" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">science so pre-scripted versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:21.720" style="s2">descriptive both really they do</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:23.430" style="s2">prescription and description because</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.720" end="00:36:26.210" style="s2">poetry is not really description it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.430" end="00:36:29.609" style="s2">octave figurative versus literal yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.210" end="00:36:31.859" style="s2">yeah so the trick is we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.609" end="00:36:35.339" style="s2">be able to use language is some way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.859" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">creating a resonance frequency or</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.339" end="00:36:40.319" style="s2">protocol match that generates a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:45.569" style="s2">for communication that is not itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.319" end="00:36:48.990" style="s2">specifically semantic which I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.569" end="00:36:50.520" style="s2">propose both parable and poetry do it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.990" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">Orient&#39;s you in the direction of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.520" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">feeling in yourself like think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:57.000" style="s2">poetry when you read a poem you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">understand the poem but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.000" end="00:37:03.930" style="s2">something about the way that the poem</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:07.950" style="s2">coordinates language helps you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.930" end="00:37:11.130" style="s2">in yourself to an experience that feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.950" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2">like the feeling that the poet was also</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.130" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:15.710" style="s2">and so it creates a possibility of there</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:20.099" style="s2">being a connection at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.710" end="00:37:23.390" style="s2">interior feeling not a connection at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.099" end="00:37:27.000" style="s2">level of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.390" end="00:37:30.420" style="s2">well something something you&#39;re I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:33.539" style="s2">it felt like you did have some future</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.420" end="00:37:36.059" style="s2">forward practicality and application in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.539" end="00:37:38.730" style="s2">your initial description you said it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.059" end="00:37:42.150" style="s2">does well with novelty and it&#39;s anti</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.730" end="00:37:43.859" style="s2">fragile and there&#39;s me as you thought of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.150" end="00:37:46.980" style="s2">it feel like timeless qualities but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.859" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">for sure feels important now and going</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.980" end="00:37:54.690" style="s2">forward and and I was wondering because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:56.069" style="s2">if we can&#39;t do the here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.690" end="00:37:58.140" style="s2">instructions on how to get back here</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.069" end="00:37:58.940" style="s2">because then we&#39;ve named a thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.140" end="00:38:03.630" style="s2">not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.940" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">and emergent coherence is kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.630" end="00:38:10.740" style="s2">weird slippery thing to pin down you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.180" end="00:38:12.359" style="s2">have communities of practice like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.740" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">Quakers and others that have spent</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.359" end="00:38:17.010" style="s2">centuries and even you know generations</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.579" end="00:38:28.319" style="s2">folks right and they have an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.539" end="00:38:31.220" style="s2">tradition of we will talk until the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.319" end="00:38:34.920" style="s2">thing that needed to get done emerges</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.220" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">but nor are we on the clock and if this</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.920" end="00:38:43.829" style="s2">takes ten minutes so be it if this takes</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:47.150" style="s2">10 days so be it so is there a version</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.829" end="00:38:52.170" style="s2">of this that is you know kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:39.080" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2">arranged based on the level of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.970" end="00:41:44.780" style="s2">of the type of people more coherence</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:47.600" style="s2">better communication protocols slightly</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.780" end="00:41:50.510" style="s2">bigger number but one way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.600" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">about the Dunbar number is a level at</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.510" end="00:41:57.770" style="s2">which the communication protocols that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">mediate the coherence break down which</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.770" end="00:42:01.640" style="s2">is what you&#39;re asking a scale question</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:05.060" style="s2">as you mentioned we&#39;ll talk it out if it</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.640" end="00:42:07.460" style="s2">takes 10 days if I&#39;ve got less than 150</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.060" end="00:42:10.150" style="s2">people say and there&#39;s a big decision</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.460" end="00:42:12.830" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna affect everybody&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.150" end="00:42:15.020" style="s2">everyone can actually enter a tribal</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.830" end="00:42:17.000" style="s2">conversation and all get to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.020" end="00:42:19.369" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna affect them which</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.000" end="00:42:20.840" style="s2">means everyone sense-making can be held</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.369" end="00:42:22.910" style="s2">together this was your question around</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.840" end="00:42:24.710" style="s2">parallel and series right it&#39;s like both</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.910" end="00:42:26.630" style="s2">those everybody sense making can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.710" end="00:42:28.550" style="s2">heard and then choice making can factor</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.630" end="00:42:29.960" style="s2">everybody sense making but if I met</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.550" end="00:42:32.420" style="s2">thousands of people there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.960" end="00:42:34.460" style="s2">have everybody talk to even hear each</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.420" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">other without some kind of technology -</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.460" end="00:42:40.040" style="s2">and so then tribes got bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:42.740" style="s2">by certain kinds of evolutionary forcing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.040" end="00:42:44.540" style="s2">functions by instituting things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.740" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">command and control hierarchy that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.540" end="00:42:48.650" style="s2">controlled the communication flows where</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:50.030" style="s2">some people were doing choice making not</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.650" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">informed by the sense making of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.030" end="00:42:53.240" style="s2">whole and now you get diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:55.130" style="s2">returns on collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.240" end="00:42:56.510" style="s2">that&#39;s been the only scaling methods</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.130" end="00:42:58.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve had and that was that angry gods</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.510" end="00:43:00.260" style="s2">hypothesis thing that we were sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.850" end="00:43:01.550" style="s2">there&#39;s many different technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.260" end="00:43:03.290" style="s2">maintaining that particular style of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.550" end="00:43:04.970" style="s2">collective intelligence which of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.290" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">I could - is called game a like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.970" end="00:43:10.580" style="s2">whole way of solving that problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:13.369" style="s2">basically game a and scaling</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.580" end="00:43:15.530" style="s2">coordination or that are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.369" end="00:43:17.930" style="s2">synonymous scaling coordination beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.530" end="00:43:20.330" style="s2">the Dunbar number huh meaning all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.930" end="00:43:22.790" style="s2">other additional bells and whistles of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.330" end="00:43:25.670" style="s2">game a you would you would assert</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.790" end="00:43:28.090" style="s2">basically I kind of follow on for how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.670" end="00:43:32.270" style="s2">you how do you control and coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.090" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">resources and humans beyond 100 250 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.270" end="00:43:38.450" style="s2">yeah money formal hierarchy the notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:40.010" style="s2">of formality in general the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.450" end="00:43:42.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a role that somebody fills as</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.010" end="00:43:45.080" style="s2">opposed to humans are just humans and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.650" end="00:43:46.550" style="s2">sometimes like that minute from formal</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.080" end="00:43:48.910" style="s2">subordination to dynamic subordination</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.550" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">that shift</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.150" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">all endeavoring to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.250" end="00:44:02.049" style="s2">shared n group identity like political</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.650" end="00:44:05.740" style="s2">left or nationality or religion or race</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.049" end="00:44:07.480" style="s2">or whatever this allows a coordination</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:13.150" style="s2">game a is basically rival risk game</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.349" end="00:44:15.130" style="s2">theory there&#39;s a way of stating it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.150" end="00:44:16.180" style="s2">sort of it has three distinct challenges</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.130" end="00:44:18.789" style="s2">that it&#39;s always trying to solve for</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.180" end="00:44:21.400" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to solve for is it able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.789" end="00:44:22.990" style="s2">coordinate so as to maintain the</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.610" end="00:48:19.100" style="s2">what&#39;s another kind of mind you might</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.100" end="00:48:22.280" style="s2">run well okay that&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.100" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">tricky question because to think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.280" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">it involves invoking the mind that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:34.490" style="s2">not to be to get rid of itself so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:36.920" style="s2">answer is first slow way the down</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:39.790" style="s2">think developmental right we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.920" end="00:48:42.770" style="s2">actually have to go all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.790" end="00:48:47.570" style="s2">conception in the developmental pathway</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.770" end="00:48:50.690" style="s2">and only do that which is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.570" end="00:48:52.610" style="s2">actually within the coherence that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.690" end="00:48:53.660" style="s2">have in fact actually have achieved this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.610" end="00:48:56.060" style="s2">is why I said you actually have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.660" end="00:48:57.020" style="s2">that Center and then build out so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.060" end="00:49:00.380" style="s2">say you want to say okay we&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.020" end="00:49:04.270" style="s2">coherence and now let&#39;s build a an</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.380" end="00:49:06.980" style="s2">organization that&#39;s like saying I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.980" end="00:49:13.190" style="s2">race car nope sorry</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.500" end="00:49:15.290" style="s2">what can you do maybe you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.190" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">have a conversation that isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.290" end="00:49:23.270" style="s2">into game a maybe sadly but development</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.420" style="s2">has a really cool thing you can get</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.270" end="00:49:28.450" style="s2">better at it so the first is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.420" end="00:49:34.120" style="s2">really recognize the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.450" end="00:49:34.120" style="s2">irreducible necessity of comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.840" end="00:49:42.290" style="s2">rebooting mind all the way down were you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.620" end="00:49:44.570" style="s2">saying all the way down down what down</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.290" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">to childhood and infancy like early</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.570" end="00:49:50.540" style="s2">childhood development as we do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:53.690" style="s2">conception so Jordan&#39;s got infant right</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.540" end="00:49:55.670" style="s2">now and we were so he&#39;s very much in</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.690" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">that active process of watching and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.670" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">supporting development we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:02.990" style="s2">about the other day I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.900" style="s2">true or not but there&#39;s at least a story</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.990" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">of some Native American tribes were when</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.900" end="00:50:10.610" style="s2">they&#39;re teaching language rather than</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.930" style="s2">and the kid first starts asking the what</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.610" end="00:50:13.820" style="s2">questions what&#39;s that what&#39;s that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.930" end="00:50:15.950" style="s2">that rather than say it&#39;s a crow in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.820" end="00:50:18.530" style="s2">mountain and a buffalo they would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.950" end="00:50:20.270" style="s2">that is the great spirit expressed as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.530" end="00:50:22.010" style="s2">crow the great spirit expressed as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.270" end="00:50:25.190" style="s2">mountain great spirit expresses Buffalo</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.010" end="00:50:27.320" style="s2">so their initial semiotic s-- their</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.190" end="00:50:29.450" style="s2">initial ontology had the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.320" end="00:50:32.900" style="s2">interconnectivity of everything first</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.450" end="00:50:34.910" style="s2">and then the distinction and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.900" end="00:50:39.290" style="s2">say all the way down it&#39;s like to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.910" end="00:50:41.990" style="s2">level of do I identify as a separate</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.290" end="00:50:43.640" style="s2">self in my own experience that can get</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.990" end="00:50:47.240" style="s2">the design game-theoretic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.640" end="00:50:50.750" style="s2">to you and identify you as other do I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.240" end="00:50:54.940" style="s2">experience that or do I experience some</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.750" end="00:50:57.740" style="s2">kind of deeper connectivity in which</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.940" end="00:50:59.300" style="s2">synergy is the only thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.740" end="00:51:00.950" style="s2">sense okay so now we&#39;re into an</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.300" end="00:51:02.690" style="s2">interesting neck of the woods right by</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.950" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">the way just practically speaking though</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.690" end="00:51:10.700" style="s2">somewhere around eleven ten eleven is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:13.850" style="s2">good place that&#39;s the level of mind from</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.700" end="00:51:15.380" style="s2">like concrete operational on up noting</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.850" end="00:51:16.790" style="s2">that you have to also deal with all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.380" end="00:51:19.460" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s going on in the body in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.790" end="00:51:21.500" style="s2">that pre period so if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.460" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">resolved childhood trauma or anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.500" end="00:51:25.430" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in terms of even simple</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:26.990" style="s2">things like bilateral integration do not</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.430" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">the right kind of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.990" end="00:51:30.050" style="s2">environment you&#39;re gonna have challenges</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">you have to actually work that whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.050" end="00:51:33.820" style="s2">thing that&#39;s my conception the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:35.840" style="s2">that happens those developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.820" end="00:51:37.340" style="s2">going back and making sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.840" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">instrument is in fact a fully</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:43.580" style="s2">up and then of course when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.730" end="00:51:44.780" style="s2">that childhood adolescence phase that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.580" end="00:51:46.760" style="s2">where a lot of the paradigmatic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.780" end="00:51:48.700" style="s2">starts to begin to layer in and of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.760" end="00:51:51.470" style="s2">course everything that you learn from</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.700" end="00:51:54.920" style="s2">17:18 on you should put go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.470" end="00:51:55.250" style="s2">shelve most of that shelve it in what</p>

<p begin="00:55:04.680" end="00:55:09.130" style="s2">beats me man I mean I feel like to your</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.810" end="00:55:10.930" style="s2">point a little bit like we have to train</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.130" end="00:55:12.280" style="s2">we have to practice you know you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.930" end="00:55:13.540" style="s2">everybody could become a same bull but</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.280" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">like you can&#39;t make a soccer team</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.540" end="00:55:16.180" style="s2">whether you&#39;re saying bow there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:17.320" style="s2">one of those sons-of-bitches and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.180" end="00:55:21.400" style="s2">faster than everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.320" end="00:55:26.280" style="s2">right and so I honest to god don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.400" end="00:55:28.420" style="s2">it feels like there needs I mean as as</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.280" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">like I hear what you&#39;re saying from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.420" end="00:55:32.620" style="s2">kind of full-on like Zen Cohen of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:34.600" style="s2">like don&#39;t name the thing and on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.620" end="00:55:36.510" style="s2">other hand if we are looking to migrate</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.600" end="00:55:39.630" style="s2">people into at least beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.510" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">practice it together however messily and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.630" end="00:55:43.990" style="s2">imperfectly what are the liberating</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.160" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">structures what are the rules to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.990" end="00:55:48.490" style="s2">infinite game right even if baked into</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:52.150" style="s2">the rules of the infinite game or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.490" end="00:55:57.810" style="s2">not the rules either how can we do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.150" end="00:56:00.730" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t have these glimpses of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.810" end="00:56:04.540" style="s2">something more shared between us that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.730" end="00:56:06.700" style="s2">continually seem to unspool and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.540" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">and here&#39;s a few that I&#39;ve seen I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.700" end="00:56:11.680" style="s2">think the key thing is to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:13.180" style="s2">obviously we don&#39;t know how because</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.680" end="00:56:18.610" style="s2">otherwise we already would have and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.180" end="00:56:20.860" style="s2">that&#39;s crucial it&#39;s important so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.610" end="00:56:22.270" style="s2">worth continuing to try which of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.860" end="00:56:23.170" style="s2">all of us know intuitively but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.270" end="00:56:26.050" style="s2">important to keep putting it out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.170" end="00:56:28.930" style="s2">and my sense is at least my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.050" end="00:56:31.240" style="s2">experience is that it&#39;s becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.930" end="00:56:33.010" style="s2">clear like I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.240" end="00:56:34.540" style="s2">wandering in the desert coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.010" end="00:56:36.220" style="s2">the same place now it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.540" end="00:56:37.420" style="s2">actually there is more and more clarity</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.220" end="00:56:42.490" style="s2">so I&#39;ll give you some examples of things</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.420" end="00:56:46.870" style="s2">that seem to be more right than wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.490" end="00:56:48.910" style="s2">one is let&#39;s just take the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.870" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">learning now what I want to do is I want</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.910" end="00:56:53.590" style="s2">to I want to shift and this is not novel</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.060" end="00:56:54.970" style="s2">like this happens there&#39;s Keats I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.590" end="00:56:56.980" style="s2">it&#39;s key is just to hold things in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.970" end="00:57:01.910" style="s2">right order the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.980" end="00:57:06.630" style="s2">teaching and cultivating Epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.910" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">and so teaching is I give you a set of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.630" end="00:57:16.290" style="s2">information I through any particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:17.490" style="s2">means generally rote endeavor to cause</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.290" end="00:57:19.050" style="s2">you to be able to repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.490" end="00:57:20.310" style="s2">information back to me and verify that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.050" end="00:57:22.710" style="s2">you&#39;ve absorbed it in a way that has</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.310" end="00:57:24.390" style="s2">high fidelity alright so that is coding</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.710" end="00:57:26.780" style="s2">its software and I&#39;m creating some sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.390" end="00:57:30.150" style="s2">of software mapping in you in</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.780" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">cultivating epiphany I try to find some</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.150" end="00:57:36.450" style="s2">how to actually generate in you the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:39.090" style="s2">insight they gave rise to that being the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.450" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">thing in the first place all right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.090" end="00:57:46.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not even teach a man to fish but</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:49.830" style="s2">cultivate in a man the the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.530" end="00:57:51.960" style="s2">becoming fisherman in himself fine that</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.830" end="00:57:56.760" style="s2">distinction is definitely one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.960" end="00:57:58.830" style="s2">distinctions generator function more</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.760" end="00:58:03.600" style="s2">than output that&#39;s a way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.830" end="00:58:06.270" style="s2">okay and then we go season now I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.600" end="00:58:08.850" style="s2">some thoughts on how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.270" end="00:58:10.680" style="s2">synthesis you said that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.850" end="00:58:13.560" style="s2">distinctions no I think this this useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.680" end="00:58:15.960" style="s2">thing of saying hey here&#39;s the here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.560" end="00:58:18.690" style="s2">the stuff I found and you know most of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.960" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">it has been a disaster but there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.690" end="00:58:23.310" style="s2">that actually kind of work so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:28.140" style="s2">let&#39;s see what else we got okay so</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.310" end="00:58:30.150" style="s2">here&#39;s a few we talked about coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.140" end="00:58:33.690" style="s2">of difference rather than coherence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.150" end="00:58:37.410" style="s2">sameness like heterogeneous coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.690" end="00:58:39.690" style="s2">correct so when you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.410" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">subordination of the individual versus</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.690" end="00:58:44.450" style="s2">individuality there&#39;s something having</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">to do with that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.450" end="00:58:48.840" style="s2">meaningfulness and a beauty and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.980" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">dignity of the individual that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.840" end="00:58:52.950" style="s2">want to subordinate in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">homogenizing way we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.950" end="00:58:56.490" style="s2">decrease the diversity that leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:59.340" style="s2">resilience of life</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.490" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">right and then the richness of it a my</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.340" end="00:59:04.080" style="s2">own discernment and choice making even</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:06.150" style="s2">as I&#39;m part of a collective that feels</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.080" end="00:59:10.350" style="s2">really important right and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.150" end="00:59:12.450" style="s2">simultaneously there are kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.350" end="00:59:13.880" style="s2">diversity and difference that only lead</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.450" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.880" end="00:59:18.900" style="s2">unreconciled bol entropic conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:22.109" style="s2">so those are not interesting kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.900" end="00:59:24.449" style="s2">diversity and so we want as much</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.109" end="00:59:28.799" style="s2">diversity as we can create synergy</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.449" end="00:59:30.989" style="s2">across we get maximum synergy from</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.799" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">maximum diversity with maximum parallax</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.989" end="00:59:36.029" style="s2">so now think about for a moment with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:38.309" style="s2">idea of parallax and just just to find</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.029" end="00:59:41.849" style="s2">that if it was like so parallax in terms</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.309" end="00:59:44.009" style="s2">of the way the two eyes neither eye has</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.849" end="00:59:47.099" style="s2">depth perception or peripheral vision</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.009" end="00:59:50.099" style="s2">right and when I have both eyes together</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.099" end="00:59:51.329" style="s2">they they have a lot of shared things</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.099" end="00:59:52.709" style="s2">that they see but because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.329" end="00:59:54.449" style="s2">different locations they also have</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.709" end="00:59:56.430" style="s2">slightly different things that they see</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.449" end="00:59:58.380" style="s2">so there&#39;s overlap a difference right</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.430" end="00:59:59.999" style="s2">and this is important so when I put the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.380" end="01:00:01.109" style="s2">two together they&#39;re not competing for</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.999" end="01:00:04.349" style="s2">which one is right that would be</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.109" end="01:00:05.999" style="s2">ridiculous right they&#39;re actually the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.349" end="01:00:07.589" style="s2">optical cortex is putting the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.999" end="01:00:09.089" style="s2">information together in a way where if</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.589" end="01:00:10.589" style="s2">there&#39;s actually an error in this one</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.089" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">it&#39;s corrected by what this one&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.589" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">so they error correct each other and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:18.089" style="s2">then because I can compute the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.079" end="01:00:20.819" style="s2">hypotenuse of the triangle I actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.089" end="01:00:22.949" style="s2">get depth perception and periphery so</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.819" end="01:00:24.660" style="s2">the two eyes together give things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.949" end="01:00:27.299" style="s2">neither of them did separately plus</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.660" end="01:00:28.890" style="s2">aircraft shape so I want them to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.299" end="01:00:30.059" style="s2">some shared reality and I want them to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.890" end="01:00:31.529" style="s2">find their shared reality but I also</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.059" end="01:00:33.229" style="s2">want them to have difference and then I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.529" end="01:00:35.759" style="s2">want them to relate in a deep way and</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.229" end="01:00:38.729" style="s2">then I wouldn&#39;t want my ears to be more</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.759" end="01:00:40.259" style="s2">eyes right like there&#39;s a deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.729" end="01:00:41.910" style="s2">parallax between ears and eyes where</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.259" end="01:00:43.380" style="s2">eyes are giving me location of things</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.910" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">and ears are giving me a different kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.380" end="01:00:47.069" style="s2">of location thing so the ears with each</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.449" style="s2">other give me echolocation and the ears</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.069" end="01:00:49.890" style="s2">and the eyes together give me a</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.449" end="01:00:53.759" style="s2">different kind of sense making in</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.890" end="01:00:56.910" style="s2">3-space so we are mr. Potato Head so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.759" end="01:00:58.589" style="s2">you think about like every imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.910" end="01:01:00.209" style="s2">the ears and eyes were just fighting</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.589" end="01:01:02.309" style="s2">over which was right and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.209" end="01:01:03.509" style="s2">was one was comprehensively right in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.309" end="01:01:04.890" style="s2">complete description of reality and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.509" end="01:01:06.089" style="s2">other was comprehensively wrong that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.890" end="01:01:08.549" style="s2">would be ridiculous we would dissolve</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.089" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">into gibberish right there is a place</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.549" end="01:01:12.869" style="s2">where they all have accurate information</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:14.459" style="s2">about reality and it&#39;s all partial this</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.869" end="01:01:16.499" style="s2">speaks to them that initiatives like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.459" end="01:01:18.059" style="s2">third that you mentioned so in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.499" end="01:01:19.049" style="s2">context when the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.059" end="01:01:22.019" style="s2">the eyes in the ears</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.049" end="01:01:24.479" style="s2">there&#39;s a third we know that third</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.019" end="01:01:27.000" style="s2">that&#39;s our experience our open vote</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.479" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">yeah right so then the question is okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.000" end="01:01:34.410" style="s2">eub eyes over years where&#39;s our third</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:35.370" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t need about that is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.410" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">then you get some very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.370" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">things where on the one hand you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.820" end="01:01:49.740" style="s2">both of us actually have a clear</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.730" end="01:01:56.220" style="s2">awareness in ourselves that we are here</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.740" end="01:02:01.980" style="s2">to with fidelity report what we perceive</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.220" end="01:02:06.170" style="s2">of reality we are deeply cognizant of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.980" end="01:02:06.170" style="s2">the fact that that is not reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.590" end="01:02:14.520" style="s2">we are deeply cogs into the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.060" end="01:02:17.190" style="s2">the other is here to report reality and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.520" end="01:02:19.620" style="s2">that somehow there is something that can</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.190" end="01:02:22.020" style="s2">happen that gives a deeper grasp of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.620" end="01:02:24.210" style="s2">reality and the reason when I&#39;m zooming</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.020" end="01:02:27.690" style="s2">in on that is that it actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.210" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">the characteristics of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.690" end="01:02:34.830" style="s2">place have to do with a a way to fully</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:35.420" style="s2">and deeply honor like all to you</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.830" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.420" end="01:02:42.390" style="s2">without the least bit of attachment to</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:44.340" style="s2">any of it and that&#39;s key you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.390" end="01:02:46.410" style="s2">actually we&#39;re not in the it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.340" end="01:02:49.260" style="s2">priests the trans so we actually want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.410" end="01:02:51.000" style="s2">know lots of stuff I want to have really</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.260" end="01:02:52.230" style="s2">amazing frameworks we want to have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.000" end="01:02:54.630" style="s2">of life experience I want to bring that</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.230" end="01:02:56.430" style="s2">all the way in but then we also didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.630" end="01:02:59.070" style="s2">want to have complete non attachment to</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.430" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">any of it and be able to code of create</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.070" end="01:03:04.230" style="s2">a bespoke since synthetic language in</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:05.760" style="s2">real time if necessary okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.230" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">kind of interesting I mean I loved all</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.760" end="01:03:10.230" style="s2">that okay so I want to add something to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:12.150" style="s2">this because this is actually like this</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.230" end="01:03:14.280" style="s2">is really exciting to me so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.150" end="01:03:16.530" style="s2">lots of senses right and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.280" end="01:03:18.380" style="s2">taking in some true information they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.530" end="01:03:21.180" style="s2">all have error and they&#39;re all partial I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.380" end="01:03:23.940" style="s2">also have lots of actuator I can move</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.180" end="01:03:26.310" style="s2">lots of different muscles and of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.940" end="01:03:28.080" style="s2">the the leg doesn&#39;t want the to compete</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.310" end="01:03:30.540" style="s2">with the arm for which one gets to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.080" end="01:03:32.010" style="s2">the actuator it actually wants to not</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.540" end="01:03:34.590" style="s2">just coordinate but to be in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.010" end="01:03:36.210" style="s2">coherence right and so I&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.590" end="01:03:38.820" style="s2">sensory stuff I got lots of actuator</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.210" end="01:03:40.740" style="s2">stuff why is it that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.820" end="01:03:42.680" style="s2">random splotches of color</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.740" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">and sound but it comes together into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.680" end="01:03:46.920" style="s2">coherence of self and world and self in</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:49.530" style="s2">relationship with world as a coherence</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.920" end="01:03:51.780" style="s2">phenomena so how all the sensing comes</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.530" end="01:03:53.250" style="s2">together inside of me is a coherence</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.780" end="01:03:55.170" style="s2">melena that&#39;s the binding problem in</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.250" end="01:03:57.390" style="s2">neuroscience right and in the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.170" end="01:03:59.550" style="s2">of mind and then the actuator why am I</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.390" end="01:04:01.170" style="s2">not how do all those parts work together</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.550" end="01:04:03.420" style="s2">so well as a coherence phenomenon so if</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.170" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">we think about that every human on their</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.420" end="01:04:09.690" style="s2">own the next level up is sensing making</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:13.589" style="s2">sense and activating but then when we</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.690" end="01:04:17.070" style="s2">come together like I want you sensing</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.589" end="01:04:19.589" style="s2">stuff differently than I am and I trust</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.070" end="01:04:23.400" style="s2">that there is information in that that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.589" end="01:04:24.990" style="s2">actually really want to have access to</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.400" end="01:04:26.880" style="s2">myself and I want the collective to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.990" end="01:04:28.920" style="s2">and I want you actuated differently than</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.880" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">I am but I really want to come into</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.920" end="01:04:35.790" style="s2">coherence so in almost right I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.230" style="s2">wasn&#39;t kind of like that the joke about</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.790" end="01:04:40.859" style="s2">mr. Potato Head is actually kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.230" end="01:04:42.660" style="s2">who is the third right if we personify</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.859" end="01:04:45.690" style="s2">and your sounds like so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.660" end="01:04:46.980" style="s2">different organs bringing different</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.690" end="01:04:49.710" style="s2">perspectives when we come together we</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.980" end="01:04:51.540" style="s2">get dimensionality right we get up</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.710" end="01:04:54.990" style="s2">whether it&#39;s echolocation of binocular</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.540" end="01:04:58.619" style="s2">vision we get more out of aggregating</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.990" end="01:05:00.470" style="s2">and integrating our realities and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.619" end="01:05:02.339" style="s2">then becomes as you said not just</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.470" end="01:05:05.910" style="s2">fragmented data feeds it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.339" end="01:05:09.650" style="s2">Gestalt boom though it becomes a reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.910" end="01:05:12.240" style="s2">for some supersensible</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.650" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">version of us that is greater than the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.240" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.780" end="01:05:17.780" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.750" end="01:05:27.490" style="s2">so you said initial conditions good with</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.880" end="01:05:30.009" style="s2">novelty and Auntie fragile but what and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.490" end="01:05:31.599" style="s2">then you also said hey the mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.009" end="01:05:33.190" style="s2">running like you take the societal</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.599" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">structure off but the mind the mind that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.190" end="01:05:37.420" style="s2">was formatted to support this assisted</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:39.250" style="s2">social structure persists even if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.420" end="01:05:40.900" style="s2">have this experience it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.250" end="01:05:42.819" style="s2">looped back through old with</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.900" end="01:05:47.140" style="s2">fundamentally gamei habits and patterns</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.819" end="01:05:50.680" style="s2">which sounds super fragile this</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.140" end="01:05:53.619" style="s2">right like like right now coherence is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.680" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">highly highly fragile yes and yet you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.619" end="01:05:57.970" style="s2">also saying it either has an inherent</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:01.029" style="s2">property or maybe you just hope that it</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.970" end="01:06:03.190" style="s2">would be ultimately eventually anti</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.029" end="01:06:04.509" style="s2">fragile can we pull that up up because I</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.190" end="01:06:07.059" style="s2">think I wouldn&#39;t be having this</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.509" end="01:06:09.369" style="s2">conversation if it was a done deal</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.059" end="01:06:11.170" style="s2">or if the first time people glimpsed it</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.369" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">we&#39;re like got it let&#39;s go rock</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.170" end="01:06:16.779" style="s2">with this this is actually wildly</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:19.690" style="s2">delicate right now yeah I think this if</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.779" end="01:06:21.490" style="s2">you if you hold in your mind the example</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.690" end="01:06:22.869" style="s2">the game of game that this happens of</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.490" end="01:06:26.890" style="s2">you like the best current example of</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.869" end="01:06:29.259" style="s2">coherence and it really is like in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.890" end="01:06:32.259" style="s2">entire universe as far as we know it by</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.259" end="01:06:35.230" style="s2">the best actual example of coherence and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.259" end="01:06:37.839" style="s2">then we say okay well if we do the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.230" end="01:06:39.339" style="s2">Anthropology and we take a look back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.839" end="01:06:44.140" style="s2">say okay well how long did it take to</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.339" end="01:06:45.549" style="s2">pull that together finding the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.140" end="01:06:49.720" style="s2">member I had that spot in possibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.549" end="01:06:51.970" style="s2">space so imagine a cube and in that cube</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.720" end="01:06:53.529" style="s2">let&#39;s make the cube 1 million by 1</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.970" end="01:06:58.059" style="s2">million by 1 million so it&#39;s a big cube</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.529" end="01:07:01.720" style="s2">ok and all over there are different</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.059" end="01:07:03.099" style="s2">kinds of phenotypes hominids happened to</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.720" end="01:07:06.029" style="s2">be a sphere about a thousand by a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.099" end="01:07:10.029" style="s2">thousand by a thousand in that cute</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.029" end="01:07:12.579" style="s2">mollusks are down here right inside the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.029" end="01:07:14.769" style="s2">sphere of hominid there&#39;s an even</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.579" end="01:07:19.329" style="s2">smaller sphere which is homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.769" end="01:07:21.039" style="s2">which is maybe five by five by five in</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.329" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">terms of the possibility space and</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.039" end="01:07:25.299" style="s2">you&#39;re talking sentient biomass what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:27.250" style="s2">your what&#39;s your million cube my cube is</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.299" end="01:07:28.900" style="s2">the well it&#39;s actually an n-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.250" end="01:07:30.250" style="s2">space but I&#39;m reducing it to three to</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.900" end="01:07:31.430" style="s2">make it work so don&#39;t put indexes on</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.250" end="01:07:32.809" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.430" end="01:07:35.630" style="s2">talk down to the beta for example didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.809" end="01:07:38.599" style="s2">exam doesn&#39;t does it hold it so the how</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.630" end="01:07:40.819" style="s2">do you find in the totality of all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.599" end="01:07:42.609" style="s2">things that are going on a particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.819" end="01:07:46.520" style="s2">complex that hangs together to</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.609" end="01:07:48.170" style="s2">particular homeostatic autocatalytic</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.520" end="01:07:49.630" style="s2">phenomenon that has the thing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.170" end="01:07:53.270" style="s2">necessary for it to actually hold</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.630" end="01:07:54.619" style="s2">coherently all right so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.270" end="01:07:57.050" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.619" end="01:07:59.540" style="s2">exploration around this little place</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.050" end="01:08:03.140" style="s2">just think of it as a place if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.540" end="01:08:04.910" style="s2">not of sapiens right so in hominid you</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.140" end="01:08:07.490" style="s2">got primate and you got hominid and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.910" end="01:08:08.630" style="s2">smaller and smaller in prime in hominid</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.490" end="01:08:10.579" style="s2">there&#39;s all these sort of explorations</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.630" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">of ok how does this thing where the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.579" end="01:08:14.780" style="s2">different ways to play in this hominid</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.839" end="01:08:18.049" style="s2">game and as you kind of get closer to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.780" end="01:08:19.910" style="s2">the the location of Homo sapiens you got</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.910" end="01:08:25.370" style="s2">a little heidelbergensis there&#39;s a some</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.660" end="01:08:27.080" style="s2">things come together but it takes like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.370" end="01:08:29.719" style="s2">million and a half years to actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.080" end="01:08:31.219" style="s2">land on Boop there&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.719" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">actually has all the different elements</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.219" end="01:08:34.910" style="s2">together by the way meta contextual it</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.339" style="s2">has not just the physiological</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.910" end="01:08:40.009" style="s2">capacities but it also has grand mothers</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.339" end="01:08:42.830" style="s2">and fathers who can actually support the</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.830" end="01:08:46.339" style="s2">plus sista to be able to actually emerge</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.390" end="01:08:47.810" style="s2">with culture so there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.339" end="01:08:49.910" style="s2">that&#39;s been put together through</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.810" end="01:08:51.830" style="s2">evolutionary process it&#39;s exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.910" end="01:08:54.529" style="s2">space of possibility and as it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.830" end="01:08:56.029" style="s2">hits there&#39;s enough bending of the space</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.529" end="01:08:58.520" style="s2">of possibility until orbits around that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.029" end="01:09:00.290" style="s2">spot alright now if you take that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.520" end="01:09:03.710" style="s2">looking at something which is inside</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.290" end="01:09:05.299" style="s2">that homo sapiens sapiens spot and my</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.710" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">hypothesized by the way has been there</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.299" end="01:09:09.049" style="s2">the whole time which just finds a meta</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:12.020" style="s2">art coming here but we&#39;re not gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.049" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">into TLT ology that is maybe it&#39;s one by</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.020" end="01:09:18.739" style="s2">one when it&#39;s a small territory but we</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:20.029" style="s2">can notice when so first we can use that</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.739" end="01:09:21.980" style="s2">as an example of saying okay this is how</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.029" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">hard it is so we&#39;re gonna kind of vector</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.980" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">in that direction and what kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:26.989" style="s2">Buddhism will emerge and kind of move</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:28.279" style="s2">the game forward a little bit and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.989" end="01:09:30.410" style="s2">kind of learn some interesting stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.279" end="01:09:31.790" style="s2">then collapse them Christianity will</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.410" end="01:09:33.799" style="s2">happen and look at him do its thing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.790" end="01:09:35.299" style="s2">a big level up occurs and the general</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.799" end="01:09:37.279" style="s2">sort of state of Homo sapiens but we</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.299" end="01:09:38.779" style="s2">don&#39;t quite get there so now we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.279" end="01:09:40.759" style="s2">this point where like all right given</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.779" end="01:09:41.960" style="s2">everything we know and given the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.759" end="01:09:44.150" style="s2">timeframe that we think we may have</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.960" end="01:09:45.170" style="s2">actually to pull this off what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.150" end="01:09:47.540" style="s2">process by which we</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.170" end="01:09:50.449" style="s2">explored and of course again the point</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.540" end="01:09:51.830" style="s2">that I&#39;m saying is to degree to which as</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.449" end="01:09:54.080" style="s2">an individual you can put yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.830" end="01:09:58.370" style="s2">inside the sphere that defines this</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.080" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">location you can get there then in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.370" end="01:10:05.090" style="s2">place can you bring other people into</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:08.300" style="s2">that place and in that place just that</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.090" end="01:10:10.820" style="s2">group what can happen there and this</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.300" end="01:10:13.340" style="s2">then the conception metaphor so now</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.820" end="01:10:14.660" style="s2">we&#39;re moving from the long-term market</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.340" end="01:10:16.300" style="s2">the species level is just took at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.660" end="01:10:22.160" style="s2">long-term are up at the individual level</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.300" end="01:10:24.440" style="s2">the fertilized egg is fragile in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.160" end="01:10:26.690" style="s2">context of once it goes through its</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.440" end="01:10:32.510" style="s2">developmental arc extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.690" end="01:10:35.030" style="s2">resilient being an adult human is kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.510" end="01:10:36.260" style="s2">of a kick-ass animal really really good</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.030" end="01:10:37.670" style="s2">at being animal but of course the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.260" end="01:10:38.330" style="s2">fertilized egg is still extremely</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.670" end="01:10:40.310" style="s2">fragile</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.330" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">so the question when I asked is like</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.310" end="01:10:43.790" style="s2">well what&#39;s our womb well I&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:48.460" style="s2">push back on that I&#39;d say a</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.790" end="01:10:51.020" style="s2">adult human this is a is a weak naked</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.460" end="01:10:52.760" style="s2">kicked by everybody but with culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.020" end="01:10:56.360" style="s2">with the instruction manual he&#39;s badass</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.760" end="01:10:59.060" style="s2">I actually disagree I would point out</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.360" end="01:11:01.010" style="s2">that the the things that just basic</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.060" end="01:11:02.870" style="s2">humans can do like the Roche it</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.010" end="01:11:04.280" style="s2">accurately are actually rather</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.870" end="01:11:06.830" style="s2">astounding in the context of the animal</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.280" end="01:11:08.510" style="s2">kingdom and the plasticity of the design</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.830" end="01:11:11.690" style="s2">parameters with human body can actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.510" end="01:11:13.580" style="s2">be trained to do that is not coded in</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.690" end="01:11:15.860" style="s2">the instinct of a given animal is as</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.580" end="01:11:18.530" style="s2">impressive as the flexibility at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.860" end="01:11:21.830" style="s2">level of ideal space that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.530" end="01:11:22.910" style="s2">Baryshnikov in the animal kingdom and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.830" end="01:11:24.920" style="s2">the egregious there is the prison to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.910" end="01:11:26.780" style="s2">carve that animal cannot also then</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.920" end="01:11:28.850" style="s2">become an Aretha Franklin I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.780" end="01:11:31.070" style="s2">actually pretty intense how much</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.850" end="01:11:34.130" style="s2">plasticity in design parameters in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.070" end="01:11:36.410" style="s2">particular physical body then of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.130" end="01:11:37.760" style="s2">you layer that plug that actuation</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.410" end="01:11:40.460" style="s2">capacity the plasticity of actuation</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.760" end="01:11:43.820" style="s2">capacity in with the plasticity of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.460" end="01:11:46.429" style="s2">perception and ideation obviously that</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.820" end="01:11:49.960" style="s2">thing is got well it gets you to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.429" end="01:11:51.530" style="s2">moon and back but I think the the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.960" end="01:11:54.110" style="s2">proposition that I think you&#39;re hitting</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.530" end="01:11:57.290" style="s2">on like the key question is recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.110" end="01:11:58.070" style="s2">that the definition or the necessary and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.290" end="01:12:00.710" style="s2">sufficient condition</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.070" end="01:12:03.099" style="s2">of coherence that I was describing is</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.710" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">very much the adult form the mature form</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.099" end="01:12:08.300" style="s2">and so it is very much the case in my</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:10.550" style="s2">experience the coherence as it currently</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.300" end="01:12:13.340" style="s2">is able to manifest ever ever actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.550" end="01:12:19.579" style="s2">able to establish it is extremely</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.340" end="01:12:20.960" style="s2">fragile and quite difficult to hold</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.579" end="01:12:22.250" style="s2">together even in just ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.960" end="01:12:24.139" style="s2">conditions much less than quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.250" end="01:12:26.630" style="s2">challenging conditions so the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.139" end="01:12:29.139" style="s2">question of scaling it is a question</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.630" end="01:12:35.570" style="s2">actually of how do we simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.139" end="01:12:38.060" style="s2">increase its let&#39;s call it strength its</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.570" end="01:12:41.389" style="s2">capacity to maintain coherence under a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.060" end="01:12:43.400" style="s2">wide variety of different conditions its</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.389" end="01:12:46.429" style="s2">scope the degree to which it can</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.400" end="01:12:48.949" style="s2">actually bring in more people and its</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.429" end="01:12:54.020" style="s2">depth the degree to which it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.949" end="01:12:55.340" style="s2">able to fully realize the synergy value</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.020" end="01:12:56.679" style="s2">of those people like instead of like a</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.340" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">narrowband</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.679" end="01:13:01.250" style="s2">broadband so the question of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:06.290" style="s2">scale coherence I think is all three of</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.250" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">those simultaneously if you would if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.290" end="01:13:09.460" style="s2">mind if we can go back to the initiative</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:12.949" style="s2">like the little things that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.460" end="01:13:17.810" style="s2">seem to be true one of the other ones</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.949" end="01:13:23.060" style="s2">that I&#39;ve found is that most of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.810" end="01:13:27.790" style="s2">failures to show up seem to actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.060" end="01:13:31.570" style="s2">fail for relatively simple reasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.790" end="01:13:31.570" style="s2">having to do with</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.739" end="01:13:43.950" style="s2">either the particularity zuv how human</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.850" end="01:13:47.580" style="s2">development in world delivers certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.950" end="01:13:49.140" style="s2">kinds of trauma or the particular it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.580" end="01:13:50.969" style="s2">about the coming to being of Homo</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.140" end="01:13:55.469" style="s2">sapiens delivery what you might call a</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.969" end="01:13:56.760" style="s2">species level trauma so either people</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.469" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">who are entering into coherence enter</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.760" end="01:13:59.610" style="s2">into relations of codependency where</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:01.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about you know the victim</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.610" end="01:14:03.510" style="s2">mindset and the savior mindset like</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.200" end="01:14:05.430" style="s2">these are all habitual responses that</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.510" end="01:14:08.489" style="s2">are either hard-coded into homo</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.430" end="01:14:12.500" style="s2">are coded in what humaneness is at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.489" end="01:14:14.989" style="s2">at the more sort of a primal level or</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.500" end="01:14:16.890" style="s2">because we are human beings who</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.989" end="01:14:19.920" style="s2">universally have been developed in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.890" end="01:14:21.780" style="s2">context of society we&#39;ve developed an</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.920" end="01:14:23.550" style="s2">enormous lee large number of blind spots</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.780" end="01:14:28.530" style="s2">bad habits and traumas as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.550" end="01:14:30.330" style="s2">of that so sort of step one of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.530" end="01:14:32.070" style="s2">sort of you know things that seem to</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.330" end="01:14:33.210" style="s2">work is you have to actually gone</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.070" end="01:14:35.550" style="s2">through all the work of actually at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.210" end="01:14:38.670" style="s2">very least resolving yourself out of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.550" end="01:14:39.989" style="s2">trauma of society to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.670" end="01:14:44.600" style="s2">know to pretty high extent to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.989" end="01:14:49.880" style="s2">perfectly honest and then having a</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.600" end="01:14:49.880" style="s2">capacity of being conscious of how</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.230" end="01:14:55.230" style="s2">biological instincts and habits that are</p>

<p begin="01:14:59.370" end="01:15:06.570" style="s2">training and there seems to be a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:15:08.040" end="01:15:14.250" style="s2">along both those kinds of work to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.250" end="01:15:17.640" style="s2">able to enter any coherence at all yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.250" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">and so because now we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.640" end="01:15:23.489" style="s2">obviously there are no folks comfortably</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:25.530" style="s2">camping out in a happy game be land and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.489" end="01:15:28.469" style="s2">anybody who are going to be the trail</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.530" end="01:15:31.050" style="s2">breakers pioneers bridge builders are</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.469" end="01:15:33.270" style="s2">going to have to be shedding game a</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.050" end="01:15:35.790" style="s2">conditioning and potentially accumulated</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.270" end="01:15:36.570" style="s2">traumas and at least but I think you</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.790" end="01:15:38.250" style="s2">know we&#39;ve had some of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.570" end="01:15:40.830" style="s2">conversations to folks that are breaking</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.250" end="01:15:42.810" style="s2">trail and even let&#39;s say folks that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.830" end="01:15:48.110" style="s2">breaking trail and leading the way and</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.810" end="01:15:50.719" style="s2">even fairly often bringing others into</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.110" end="01:15:53.150" style="s2">experiences of coherence themselves</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:55.880" style="s2">suddenly too significantly still</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.150" end="01:16:00.710" style="s2">traumatize the wounded healers right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.880" end="01:16:02.000" style="s2">so and even in an instant specifically</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.710" end="01:16:05.150" style="s2">we people to come across a community</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:06.409" style="s2">that&#39;s dedicated to working on all those</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.150" end="01:16:07.940" style="s2">traumas in fact there&#39;s then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.409" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">quite a few there&#39;s quite a few that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.940" end="01:16:12.830" style="s2">know engaging in their access point to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:15.530" style="s2">communitas is through helping people</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.830" end="01:16:17.239" style="s2">better engage experience catharsis right</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.530" end="01:16:18.170" style="s2">and then you get this ecstatic moment of</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.239" end="01:16:19.580" style="s2">like holy</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.170" end="01:16:20.960" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re healed we&#39;re whole we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.580" end="01:16:25.369" style="s2">connected isn&#39;t this beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.960" end="01:16:27.350" style="s2">amazing and then it unspools right there</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.369" end="01:16:29.690" style="s2">and the question is like well wait is it</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.350" end="01:16:31.489" style="s2">just we need to do more of the thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.690" end="01:16:33.350" style="s2">that these guys are already doing they</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.489" end="01:16:36.369" style="s2">were partial or they weren&#39;t quite there</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.350" end="01:16:38.929" style="s2">yet and do we get into some puritanical</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.369" end="01:16:41.540" style="s2">increasingly high buff or who gets to</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.929" end="01:16:43.580" style="s2">play at the coherence game because you</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.540" end="01:16:47.330" style="s2">know you&#39;re bringing your dirty shoes</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.580" end="01:16:48.830" style="s2">into our pure petri dish like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.330" end="01:16:51.350" style="s2">actually help the transitional</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.830" end="01:16:53.739" style="s2">generations generations well I think you</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.350" end="01:16:56.119" style="s2">already said that key piece so one is</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.739" end="01:16:57.889" style="s2">humility the other is patience I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.119" end="01:17:02.290" style="s2">one of the problems that tends to happen</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.889" end="01:17:05.480" style="s2">is there&#39;s a real significant meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.290" end="01:17:07.670" style="s2">breakthrough which then takes itself up</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.480" end="01:17:11.300" style="s2">set as having been to the breakthrough</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.670" end="01:17:13.670" style="s2">oh we did it awesome we&#39;re there right</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.300" end="01:17:15.380" style="s2">as opposed to a okay this is probably a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.670" end="01:17:18.949" style="s2">three to five maybe six generation</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.380" end="01:17:21.409" style="s2">process so it&#39;s a more like this this</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.949" end="01:17:23.080" style="s2">less like this movement and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.409" end="01:17:25.580" style="s2">directionality with just an</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.080" end="01:17:27.409" style="s2">incomprehensible level of constantly</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.580" end="01:17:31.100" style="s2">going into humility and recognizing that</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.409" end="01:17:35.210" style="s2">no matter how much seems to have been</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.100" end="01:17:40.630" style="s2">done we may only be eight percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.210" end="01:17:40.630" style="s2">way there and so that&#39;s a lot left and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.590" end="01:17:45.800" style="s2">some since that&#39;s that but you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.030" end="01:17:48.139" style="s2">always get you can get closer and and if</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.800" end="01:17:49.159" style="s2">when you are closer this is crucial</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.139" end="01:17:51.590" style="s2">right being able to distinguish the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.159" end="01:17:55.040" style="s2">difference between when you are more</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.590" end="01:17:56.599" style="s2">towards that unless and then being able</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.040" end="01:17:59.239" style="s2">to notice that the choices that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.599" end="01:18:00.889" style="s2">coming from more towards that are the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.239" end="01:18:01.770" style="s2">ones that should be leading your choice</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.889" end="01:18:03.240" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.770" end="01:18:05.330" style="s2">and the choices that are coming from</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.240" end="01:18:08.010" style="s2">less from that other one should be</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.330" end="01:18:10.920" style="s2">trailing and fading so you actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.010" end="01:18:12.720" style="s2">become a vector and so that then you</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.920" end="01:18:15.420" style="s2">become better and better at using that</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.720" end="01:18:18.120" style="s2">sense of more like this that&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.420" end="01:18:19.530" style="s2">in more and more of your choices you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.120" end="01:18:21.330" style="s2">actually begin to get a very nice</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.530" end="01:18:26.040" style="s2">progressive movement in that container</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.330" end="01:18:30.060" style="s2">of humility and patience with enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.040" end="01:18:32.340" style="s2">runway and enough tolerance for creative</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.060" end="01:18:33.150" style="s2">destruction because you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.340" end="01:18:34.890" style="s2">you&#39;d run away</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.150" end="01:18:36.810" style="s2">well time Danny because you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.890" end="01:18:38.190" style="s2">like hey humans are amazing and check us</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.810" end="01:18:39.930" style="s2">out we can figure out living in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.190" end="01:18:42.270" style="s2">Arctic in the deserts well not really</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.930" end="01:18:44.160" style="s2">you drop any single naked monkey in</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.270" end="01:18:47.190" style="s2">either of those places they&#39;re dead in</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.160" end="01:18:49.680" style="s2">72 hours but right right but but enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.190" end="01:18:51.960" style="s2">clothes but no cigars and some lucky</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.680" end="01:18:53.580" style="s2">bastard finally figures it out and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.960" end="01:18:54.870" style="s2">that gets encoded in culture and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.580" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">not everybody has to die and suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.870" end="01:19:00.060" style="s2">where it desert tribe or where did the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.880" end="01:19:03.510" style="s2">Inuit right so so how do we do this if</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.060" end="01:19:06.270" style="s2">right there&#39;s both fragility and not in</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.510" end="01:19:09.630" style="s2">definite time I am reminded of the movie</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.270" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">the Martian what I notice is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.630" end="01:19:14.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a another trap two traps</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:17.370" style="s2">actually one trap is the trap of urgency</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.520" end="01:19:19.740" style="s2">and the other trap is the trap of like</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.370" end="01:19:21.570" style="s2">perceived a responsibility when you say</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.740" end="01:19:23.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a trap of urgency meaning the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.570" end="01:19:26.430" style="s2">perception and then the acting as if or</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.910" end="01:19:28.230" style="s2">do you mean the actual the perception of</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.430" end="01:19:30.900" style="s2">the acting as if which is in fact fully</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.230" end="01:19:35.490" style="s2">accurate fully accurate perception and</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.900" end="01:19:38.100" style="s2">the acting as if is a trap right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.490" end="01:19:40.830" style="s2">the it&#39;s the notion of you know James</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.830" end="01:19:46.050" style="s2">ticking he has to actually be acting as</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.250" end="01:19:59.070" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s another key right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.930" end="01:20:00.900" style="s2">this happens all the time as you get it</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.070" end="01:20:02.370" style="s2">and now you can see it happen I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.900" end="01:20:04.680" style="s2">that happen many times in myself or</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.370" end="01:20:07.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a recognition of the urgency</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.680" end="01:20:10.530" style="s2">which leads to a certain hardening and a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.380" end="01:20:13.080" style="s2">certain willingness to explain moving</p>

<p begin="01:20:14.860" end="01:20:23.730" style="s2">or rationalizing pulling from the game a</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:28.090" style="s2">toolkit oh that&#39;s a doozy you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.730" end="01:20:31.090" style="s2">okay that speaks very much to what you</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.090" end="01:20:34.329" style="s2">are saying in terms of people falling</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.090" end="01:20:36.610" style="s2">out of their state and we could talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.329" end="01:20:38.440" style="s2">about what a stage development take from</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.610" end="01:20:40.630" style="s2">State experience but we could also talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.440" end="01:20:42.670" style="s2">about what are the sources of fragility</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.630" end="01:20:44.110" style="s2">if we want to talk about antifragility</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.670" end="01:20:45.489" style="s2">we should understand the sources of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.110" end="01:20:50.050" style="s2">fragility and what we can do with those</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.489" end="01:20:52.270" style="s2">and so some simple constructs if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.050" end="01:20:55.449" style="s2">endeavoring to create some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.270" end="01:20:57.489" style="s2">coherence we could have that breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.449" end="01:21:00.849" style="s2">from internal forces or external forces</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.489" end="01:21:04.179" style="s2">are both right so external forces means</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.849" end="01:21:05.800" style="s2">rival risks type dynamics which is an</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.179" end="01:21:08.920" style="s2">in-group that is smaller than everything</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.800" end="01:21:11.320" style="s2">given that it is still interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.920" end="01:21:15.099" style="s2">the rest of the world that it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.320" end="01:21:16.270" style="s2">in so I would say all in groups that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.099" end="01:21:20.050" style="s2">smaller than everything have some</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.270" end="01:21:23.020" style="s2">inherent fragility of that kind then we</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.050" end="01:21:24.429" style="s2">can look at dynamics on the inside that</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.020" end="01:21:26.500" style="s2">could cause fragility and breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.429" end="01:21:28.449" style="s2">which is actually going into rival risk</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.500" end="01:21:30.250" style="s2">type dynamics with each other because</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.449" end="01:21:32.380" style="s2">the coherence that brings about the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.250" end="01:21:33.849" style="s2">synergy that brings about the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.380" end="01:21:36.130" style="s2">capacities that actually gets selected</p>

<p begin="01:21:40.420" end="01:21:46.030" style="s2">allows a very deep type of synergy to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.599" end="01:21:50.159" style="s2">occur I&#39;d like to have a proposal meta</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.030" end="01:21:53.230" style="s2">and then meta meta move the meta move</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.159" end="01:21:56.099" style="s2">I&#39;m noticing that the conversation has a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.230" end="01:21:57.820" style="s2">particular topology to it I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.099" end="01:22:01.270" style="s2">why that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.820" end="01:22:02.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s meta because I presume that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.270" end="01:22:09.400" style="s2">answer to that curiosity will have</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.980" end="01:22:12.730" style="s2">something to do with either homos we are</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.400" end="01:22:14.020" style="s2">in fact primates or something about our</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.730" end="01:22:15.790" style="s2">developmental environment this causes</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.020" end="01:22:17.980" style="s2">topology to choose spontaneously emerge</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.790" end="01:22:21.340" style="s2">which is to say that the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.980" end="01:22:23.199" style="s2">a V Daniel&#39;s talking to you I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.340" end="01:22:25.949" style="s2">to you Daniel and I are not talking to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.199" end="01:22:27.989" style="s2">each other and there is no third</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.949" end="01:22:30.540" style="s2">like something right there yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.989" end="01:22:32.310" style="s2">that&#39;s one that&#39;s the meta move why why</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.540" end="01:22:35.550" style="s2">is why did that topology settle in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.310" end="01:22:39.150" style="s2">way that it settled in then the the meta</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.550" end="01:22:41.190" style="s2">meta move they unfortunate oh the meta</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.150" end="01:22:44.190" style="s2">meta move is of course in the act of</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.190" end="01:22:46.710" style="s2">actually contemplating the meta we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.190" end="01:22:48.840" style="s2">in fact endeavor to be doing it rather</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.710" end="01:22:50.610" style="s2">than talking about it and we can notice</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.840" end="01:22:52.170" style="s2">how the doing it informs the talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.610" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">about it in a fashion that resolves the</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.170" end="01:23:01.530" style="s2">question and in addition to the three of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:05.190" style="s2">us and whatever the container or</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.530" end="01:23:08.280" style="s2">emergent is this is also on film and</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.190" end="01:23:10.350" style="s2">there&#39;s the consciousness of the people</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.280" end="01:23:14.460" style="s2">who are watching it which I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.350" end="01:23:19.410" style="s2">sensing into and wanting to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.460" end="01:23:21.660" style="s2">that this is hopefully useful for so</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.410" end="01:23:24.140" style="s2">that&#39;s included in the consideration</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.660" end="01:23:27.480" style="s2">something between comprehensible and/or</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.140" end="01:23:30.239" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s a third to the enth</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.480" end="01:23:31.860" style="s2">I mean I I would at least I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.239" end="01:23:35.870" style="s2">there was never been moments little</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.860" end="01:23:39.480" style="s2">blips where there&#39;s been at least for me</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.870" end="01:23:41.400" style="s2">new or interesting perspectives and our</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.480" end="01:23:43.560" style="s2">house and insights and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.400" end="01:23:45.270" style="s2">whether that&#39;s things I just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.560" end="01:23:50.179" style="s2">heard you guys say before or whether</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.270" end="01:23:50.179" style="s2">those are actually you know imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.770" end="01:23:55.199" style="s2">yes what I&#39;m noticing is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.880" end="01:23:57.330" style="s2">noticing a feeling that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.199" end="01:23:58.500" style="s2">being something coming from Daniel that</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.330" end="01:24:00.179" style="s2">actually creates the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.500" end="01:24:01.679" style="s2">symmetry in the conversation so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.179" end="01:24:04.260" style="s2">interested in getting your perspective</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.679" end="01:24:06.449" style="s2">in a fashion that is not responsive but</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.260" end="01:24:08.870" style="s2">is in fact direct like coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.449" end="01:24:08.870" style="s2">inside out</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.610" end="01:24:23.330" style="s2">the thing that was feeling to share I</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.820" end="01:24:28.020" style="s2">just didn&#39;t hear a spot where it was in</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.330" end="01:24:29.550" style="s2">it was relevant actually very much</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.020" end="01:24:31.230" style="s2">connects to the conversation that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.550" end="01:24:36.270" style="s2">two of you were having but it was what I</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.230" end="01:24:41.130" style="s2">was thinking about anyways which is this</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.270" end="01:24:43.850" style="s2">relationship between the subordination</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.130" end="01:24:48.780" style="s2">of the individual for the collective and</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.850" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">the sovereignty of the individual like</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.780" end="01:24:56.880" style="s2">fractal sovereignty and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:58.890" style="s2">about the body as an analogy of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.880" end="01:25:02.370" style="s2">such a fascinating thing where all of</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.890" end="01:25:05.850" style="s2">the cells are autonomous agents governed</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.370" end="01:25:07.410" style="s2">by their own internal genetic code they</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.850" end="01:25:09.660" style="s2">could grow in a petri dish for some</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.410" end="01:25:12.000" style="s2">period of time but they&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.660" end="01:25:13.620" style="s2">a way that is both in their own good</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.000" end="01:25:15.090" style="s2">interest and in the interest of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.620" end="01:25:17.130" style="s2">other cells around them in the entire</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.090" end="01:25:20.220" style="s2">body simultaneously so there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.130" end="01:25:21.570" style="s2">theory of trade-offs of what is good for</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.220" end="01:25:23.400" style="s2">them is damaging other or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.570" end="01:25:25.950" style="s2">sacrificing themselves for other and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.400" end="01:25:27.870" style="s2">that&#39;s tripped the level of cell-to-cell</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.950" end="01:25:30.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s also true at the level of organ</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.870" end="01:25:34.110" style="s2">to organ and organ systems organ system</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.180" end="01:25:36.720" style="s2">and cell to organ so at vertical levels</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.110" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">and horizontal levels there&#39;s this kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.720" end="01:25:41.970" style="s2">of just radical anti rival risk synergy</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:44.040" style="s2">of sovereign things of things that have</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.970" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">their own self-organizing boundary the</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.040" end="01:25:48.090" style="s2">facha of the organ the cell membrane and</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:51.900" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that at the next</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.090" end="01:25:53.460" style="s2">level of organism to organism and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.900" end="01:25:56.220" style="s2">done that up to tribe and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.460" end="01:25:59.310" style="s2">talking about beyond tribal scale but</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.220" end="01:26:00.480" style="s2">that that kind of process and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.310" end="01:26:05.250" style="s2">thinking about cancer in the body</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.480" end="01:26:07.320" style="s2">because a cancer cell starts doing what</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.250" end="01:26:09.330" style="s2">seems to be in the short-term better for</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.320" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">it it actually replicates it consumes</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.330" end="01:26:14.100" style="s2">and replicates faster but it breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:15.480" style="s2">the coherence of the whole and in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.100" end="01:26:17.340" style="s2">process it ends up killing itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.480" end="01:26:19.140" style="s2">killing its progeny right it suicides</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.340" end="01:26:21.600" style="s2">because it debases the substrate that it</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.140" end="01:26:23.860" style="s2">depends upon in kind of a short term</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.600" end="01:26:31.210" style="s2">small-minded focus</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.860" end="01:26:33.500" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this idea like regard to</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.210" end="01:26:35.300" style="s2">like the there&#39;s an interesting feeling</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.500" end="01:26:38.510" style="s2">even of that way of speaking of it as</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.300" end="01:26:41.060" style="s2">subordinate the individual and I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.510" end="01:26:42.290" style="s2">just thinking of Einstein&#39;s quote that</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.060" end="01:26:44.030" style="s2">it&#39;s an optical delusion of</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.290" end="01:26:46.280" style="s2">consciousness to think there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.030" end="01:26:48.620" style="s2">separate things when in fact there is</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.280" end="01:26:53.680" style="s2">one integrated reality that we call</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.620" end="01:26:56.780" style="s2">universe and so like we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.680" end="01:26:59.810" style="s2">rationally get and something I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.780" end="01:27:01.160" style="s2">about all the time is ok I can think</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.810" end="01:27:04.190" style="s2">about myself as a separate thing but</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.160" end="01:27:06.440" style="s2">what am i without the atmosphere I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.190" end="01:27:08.090" style="s2">even exist what am i without the plants</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.440" end="01:27:09.890" style="s2">that generate the atmosphere I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.090" end="01:27:11.960" style="s2">even exist what am i without the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.890" end="01:27:13.550" style="s2">electromagnetic field without the earth</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.960" end="01:27:15.110" style="s2">without gravity without the other people</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.550" end="01:27:18.140" style="s2">that made the things that I use and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.110" end="01:27:20.540" style="s2">concepts that I use so when I get that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.140" end="01:27:21.820" style="s2">I&#39;m an emergent property of the hole</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.540" end="01:27:24.740" style="s2">that has uniqueness and individuality</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.820" end="01:27:26.770" style="s2">but it&#39;s not separable from that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.740" end="01:27:29.540" style="s2">distinctness doesn&#39;t mean separable &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.770" end="01:27:31.550" style="s2">then I have both distinct and</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.540" end="01:27:34.190" style="s2">inseparable simultaneously so I have</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.550" end="01:27:36.500" style="s2">interconnected with the whole and having</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.190" end="01:27:38.000" style="s2">a unique role to play and so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.500" end="01:27:41.240" style="s2">dialectic there is something that</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.000" end="01:27:43.400" style="s2">increases actually the distinction and</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.240" end="01:27:48.520" style="s2">the uniqueness and increases the synergy</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.400" end="01:27:51.380" style="s2">and interconnectivity simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.520" end="01:27:53.150" style="s2">the first part is to just recognize if</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.380" end="01:27:54.890" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the cancer thing it will end</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.150" end="01:27:57.020" style="s2">up being bad for what I care about too</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.890" end="01:27:59.450" style="s2">even if in the short term it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.020" end="01:28:00.920" style="s2">a good thing and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.450" end="01:28:03.460" style="s2">thing with rivalries game theory that</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.920" end="01:28:06.190" style="s2">we&#39;re at the place where we realize</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.460" end="01:28:09.850" style="s2">exponentially larger extraction and</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.190" end="01:28:13.220" style="s2">pollution and war an information war is</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.850" end="01:28:14.810" style="s2">existential now so we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.220" end="01:28:16.460" style="s2">rationalize that we can keep doing it</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.810" end="01:28:17.500" style="s2">that way I&#39;m noticing understand that</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.460" end="01:28:20.750" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get to the feeling of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.500" end="01:28:23.510" style="s2">which is by the way quite hard but one</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.750" end="01:28:24.800" style="s2">of the places I landed was that you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.510" end="01:28:27.080" style="s2">we still have that nice example of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.800" end="01:28:28.430" style="s2">jazz band fortunately we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.080" end="01:28:31.190" style="s2">concrete examples of what these things</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.430" end="01:28:33.320" style="s2">are like to be in and I&#39;m noticing that</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.190" end="01:28:36.010" style="s2">as a player in the jazz band that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.320" end="01:28:36.010" style="s2">feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.440" end="01:28:42.230" style="s2">not being subordinated to the whole but</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.430" end="01:28:43.970" style="s2">actually somehow being supported in</p>

<p begin="01:28:43.970" end="01:28:48.680" style="s2">individuation is felt so the question of</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.030" end="01:28:50.750" style="s2">course was that feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.680" end="01:28:54.650" style="s2">interesting to notice that while some</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.750" end="01:28:56.720" style="s2">people not many I think try to think</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.650" end="01:28:58.370" style="s2">about that strategically like okay how</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.720" end="01:28:59.140" style="s2">do I make sure that I am in fact</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.370" end="01:29:03.290" style="s2">protected</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.140" end="01:29:05.870" style="s2">most people are in fact proceeding by do</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.290" end="01:29:08.240" style="s2">I actually feel like I am increasing my</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.870" end="01:29:09.740" style="s2">autonomy do I feel more agenting and</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.240" end="01:29:12.920" style="s2">more autonomous and more able to express</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.740" end="01:29:15.890" style="s2">my essence or selfness</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.920" end="01:29:17.840" style="s2">into world symmetries like what does</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.890" end="01:29:19.400" style="s2">that feel like to actually move into</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.840" end="01:29:20.510" style="s2">that place and if we could do it like</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.400" end="01:29:22.160" style="s2">what would actually have felt like for</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.510" end="01:29:24.080" style="s2">this single cell going into the multi</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.160" end="01:29:25.970" style="s2">cell because there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.080" end="01:29:34.160" style="s2">quality of that that we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.970" end="01:29:39.710" style="s2">grasp at that level you&#39;ve done it many</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.160" end="01:29:40.970" style="s2">times it made different modes like</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.710" end="01:29:43.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve done it when you&#39;ve gone like</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.970" end="01:29:45.620" style="s2">creating a team&#39;s doing athletic</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.250" end="01:29:47.810" style="s2">activities together so they flow into</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.620" end="01:29:49.670" style="s2">something but where the place where each</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.810" end="01:29:51.830" style="s2">individual begins to drop into a space</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.670" end="01:29:56.150" style="s2">where they are at their peak as an</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.830" end="01:29:58.610" style="s2">individual so yeah and that feels like</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.150" end="01:30:00.320" style="s2">something you know straight forwardly</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.610" end="01:30:02.240" style="s2">obvious which is basically my</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.320" end="01:30:03.920" style="s2">coordinators are met and I&#39;ve seen in my</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.240" end="01:30:05.810" style="s2">worldview and everything and and my</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.920" end="01:30:08.360" style="s2">needs are validated such that I can then</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.810" end="01:30:10.280" style="s2">drop them in order to play you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.360" end="01:30:12.650" style="s2">going from my five finite game of</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.280" end="01:30:16.310" style="s2">separate self into a more infinite game</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.650" end="01:30:19.130" style="s2">of emergence and it feels like there</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.310" end="01:30:21.350" style="s2">also needs to be a tolerance for</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.130" end="01:30:23.990" style="s2">ambiguity and a willingness to get messy</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.350" end="01:30:27.160" style="s2">so back to the jazz guys I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.990" end="01:30:30.470" style="s2">consistently the most righteous jams</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.160" end="01:30:33.500" style="s2">come out of kind of going in down into</p>

<p begin="01:31:01.940" end="01:31:05.910" style="s2">essential and and I don&#39;t know that when</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.890" end="01:31:08.340" style="s2">you were just kind of cuz I mean as soon</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.910" end="01:31:10.469" style="s2">as you described organisms organs and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.340" end="01:31:12.449" style="s2">was like oh yeah okay so social media</p>

<p begin="01:31:17.160" end="01:31:22.739" style="s2">like the cancerous impulse that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.429" end="01:31:25.230" style="s2">experiencing right now and when we come</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.739" end="01:31:27.870" style="s2">when we glimpse this emergence or of</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.230" end="01:31:30.270" style="s2">coherence it&#39;s sort of like oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.870" end="01:31:31.739" style="s2">you know your life&#39;s work and special</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.270" end="01:31:34.080" style="s2">like the thing you&#39;re uniquely designed</p>

<p begin="01:31:34.080" end="01:31:37.980" style="s2">sense might be called Dhamma you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.850" end="01:31:40.350" style="s2">fits perfectly with the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.980" end="01:31:42.570" style="s2">uniquely here to do and holy I was</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.350" end="01:31:45.060" style="s2">carrying this thing it was lonely it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.570" end="01:31:46.739" style="s2">hard it was scary it was heavy but now I</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.060" end="01:31:48.210" style="s2">think that actually these pieces lay</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.739" end="01:31:49.800" style="s2">down beside each other and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.210" end="01:31:52.949" style="s2">actually beginning to see a picture that</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.800" end="01:31:57.179" style="s2">none of us held and none of us could see</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.949" end="01:31:59.370" style="s2">and that to me is like I think how this</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.179" end="01:32:00.900" style="s2">happens but on the other hand we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.370" end="01:32:02.460" style="s2">having people be like oh that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.900" end="01:32:04.620" style="s2">damn picture let me just scribble it and</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.460" end="01:32:05.610" style="s2">snap a selfie and post it well</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.620" end="01:32:07.830" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting that happens</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.610" end="01:32:09.390" style="s2">there right so as an individual if</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.830" end="01:32:11.870" style="s2">particularly the social environment if</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.390" end="01:32:14.370" style="s2">you take responsibility in yourself</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.870" end="01:32:15.600" style="s2">mmm-me to this right okay so the human</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.370" end="01:32:17.160" style="s2">instrument I think has a really</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.600" end="01:32:19.410" style="s2">fine-tuned ability to discern the</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.160" end="01:32:22.610" style="s2">distinction between those two things so</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.410" end="01:32:25.440" style="s2">you can tell when somebody&#39;s faking it</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.610" end="01:32:26.910" style="s2">in a deep way like something in your gut</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.440" end="01:32:29.400" style="s2">is telling you something&#39;s off they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.910" end="01:32:30.690" style="s2">not connected they&#39;re not expressing</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.400" end="01:32:32.580" style="s2">something that&#39;s coming from their heart</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.690" end="01:32:34.230" style="s2">all right they&#39;re playing somebody</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.580" end="01:32:38.910" style="s2">else&#39;s jam or whatever the phrase is</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.230" end="01:32:43.080" style="s2">that you use if you don&#39;t when that</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.910" end="01:32:47.219" style="s2">happens if you give that attention if</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.080" end="01:32:49.739" style="s2">you give it energy you are up</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.219" end="01:32:52.949" style="s2">everything it is crucial as an</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.739" end="01:32:55.620" style="s2">individual that on the one hand when</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.949" end="01:32:58.800" style="s2">somebody is actually out on the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.620" end="01:33:00.239" style="s2">tightrope in the middle of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.800" end="01:33:01.120" style="s2">figure out how to express something from</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.239" end="01:33:03.160" style="s2">the heart that is very</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.120" end="01:33:06.220" style="s2">chuckles that you actually call it</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.160" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s gold well done awesome and on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.220" end="01:33:11.410" style="s2">other hand when you feel it no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.800" end="01:33:15.610" style="s2">something off about that this guy here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.410" end="01:33:18.190" style="s2">faking it that you also express that</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.610" end="01:33:19.300" style="s2">clearly and so the what happens you</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.190" end="01:33:21.460" style="s2">could have very interesting set of</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.300" end="01:33:23.020" style="s2">feedback loops to degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.460" end="01:33:25.840" style="s2">everybody&#39;s playing the game of both</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.020" end="01:33:28.390" style="s2">participant and curator with</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.840" end="01:33:29.500" style="s2">authenticity and skillfulness you</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.390" end="01:33:31.810" style="s2">actually start getting positive feedback</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.500" end="01:33:36.730" style="s2">loops that move into a space that</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.810" end="01:33:38.830" style="s2">increasingly anti fragile power but if</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.730" end="01:33:43.180" style="s2">there&#39;s defection and the defection here</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.830" end="01:33:44.380" style="s2">I mean things like laziness or bad habit</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.180" end="01:33:45.940" style="s2">or of course obviously just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.380" end="01:33:46.900" style="s2">faction defection like oh I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.940" end="01:33:50.980" style="s2">steal that and run with it</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.900" end="01:33:52.510" style="s2">then it doesn&#39;t come together so but</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.980" end="01:33:53.890" style="s2">this is this this is nice right this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.510" end="01:33:56.770" style="s2">fine like two degree to which Jamie you</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.890" end="01:33:58.090" style="s2">show up consistently every single time</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.770" end="01:34:00.250" style="s2">willing to put it on the line and</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.090" end="01:34:04.780" style="s2">calling what is true true and calling</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.250" end="01:34:07.510" style="s2">what is false false then and I meet you</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.780" end="01:34:08.500" style="s2">there trying to do the same thing what</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.510" end="01:34:10.720" style="s2">ends up happening is that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.500" end="01:34:12.610" style="s2">build a relationship that has resilience</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.720" end="01:34:13.960" style="s2">to it there&#39;s strength to it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.610" end="01:34:16.420" style="s2">strength to it both in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.960" end="01:34:18.640" style="s2">can have confidence in it and in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.420" end="01:34:19.930" style="s2">sense that it can do more than a</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.640" end="01:34:22.900" style="s2">relationship that doesn&#39;t have that in</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.930" end="01:34:25.300" style="s2">it so there is actually a natural like</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.900" end="01:34:27.910" style="s2">orientation towards strength that does</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.300" end="01:34:31.420" style="s2">show up there but is also based on</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.910" end="01:34:33.310" style="s2">skillfulness determined at the bottom to</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.420" end="01:34:34.420" style="s2">be a consumer and a curator because</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.310" end="01:34:38.140" style="s2">otherwise you got the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.420" end="01:34:39.130" style="s2">Burning Man and fire festival yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.140" end="01:34:42.010" style="s2">this is goes back to that problem of</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.130" end="01:34:43.630" style="s2">society so much with discernment is just</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.010" end="01:34:46.510" style="s2">like almost the first thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.630" end="01:34:48.570" style="s2">beaten out is discernment and so being</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.510" end="01:34:51.730" style="s2">able to come back and do things like</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.570" end="01:34:53.830" style="s2">recognize the whole thing here is part</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.730" end="01:34:56.050" style="s2">of discernment and being able to listen</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.830" end="01:34:57.310" style="s2">and say okay my heart aches when</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.050" end="01:34:59.890" style="s2">somebody says something alright well</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.310" end="01:35:01.690" style="s2">that&#39;s probably real deep important true</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.890" end="01:35:04.390" style="s2">learn how to listen to it learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.690" end="01:35:06.630" style="s2">speak what it means with clarity so this</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.390" end="01:35:09.250" style="s2">is I came that minimum ingredient</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.630" end="01:35:11.680" style="s2">discernment is a minimum ingredient and</p>

<p begin="01:35:17.250" end="01:35:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an easy thing to say increase your</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.780" end="01:35:24.820" style="s2">discernment it&#39;s never a bad idea to</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.560" end="01:35:26.740" style="s2">your earlier call there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.820" end="01:35:28.450" style="s2">something that I feel to add the</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.450" end="01:35:33.100" style="s2">yet but actually was feeling into and</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.780" end="01:35:35.520" style="s2">wanted to speak to the kind of topology</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.100" end="01:35:37.510" style="s2">you were noticing because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.520" end="01:35:42.010" style="s2">something that I noticed about I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.510" end="01:35:44.350" style="s2">is actually really nice so we could ask</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.010" end="01:35:45.790" style="s2">is it because Jamie is sitting in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.350" end="01:35:49.030" style="s2">corner and it&#39;s literally just the</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.790" end="01:35:51.670" style="s2">physicality of it there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.030" end="01:35:53.080" style="s2">number of factors but it makes heaps of</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.670" end="01:35:54.520" style="s2">sense that you and I have actually got</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.080" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">to have more conversations on these</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.520" end="01:35:59.350" style="s2">topics more recently than we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:36:01.720" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an assumed knowing we</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.350" end="01:36:03.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t all get to jam before on this or</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.720" end="01:36:05.680" style="s2">prepare this this is real-time</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.040" end="01:36:08.500" style="s2">extemporaneous and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.680" end="01:36:12.870" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever even expressed Rule Omega to</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.500" end="01:36:17.680" style="s2">Jamie but he&#39;s just doing it yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.870" end="01:36:19.240" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of openly inquiring into the</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.680" end="01:36:21.520" style="s2">questions that are really alive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.240" end="01:36:22.840" style="s2">a little bit easier for us to riff off</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.520" end="01:36:24.730" style="s2">what each other saying because we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.840" end="01:36:27.610" style="s2">some recently shared language on these</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.730" end="01:36:29.920" style="s2">things and but the rule Omega is</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.610" end="01:36:32.860" style="s2">actually a really simple practical thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:38.560" style="s2">that I towards coherence that I would</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.860" end="01:36:40.870" style="s2">like everybody here to get is if if</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.560" end="01:36:43.750" style="s2">Jordan mare talking or if you and I are</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.870" end="01:36:45.070" style="s2">talking like we we have this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.750" end="01:36:48.780" style="s2">we naturally have it as worth making</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.070" end="01:36:53.290" style="s2">explicit is if you say something that</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.780" end="01:36:56.110" style="s2">sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.290" end="01:36:59.470" style="s2">or wrong I actually give the benefit of</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.110" end="01:37:01.960" style="s2">the doubt that you might have a reason</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.470" end="01:37:03.790" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t understand first so rather</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.960" end="01:37:08.500" style="s2">than just default into you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.790" end="01:37:10.000" style="s2">wrong ask more questions and and that</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.500" end="01:37:12.040" style="s2">giving the benefit of the doubt that you</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.000" end="01:37:15.730" style="s2">actually might have something useful to</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.040" end="01:37:17.830" style="s2">say increases my making sure that I</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.730" end="01:37:20.140" style="s2">understand you before I&#39;m responding and</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.830" end="01:37:21.220" style="s2">that actually and the disagreeing was</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.140" end="01:37:22.750" style="s2">something that you weren&#39;t even saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.220" end="01:37:25.240" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t seek to understand well</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.750" end="01:37:27.040" style="s2">enough creates very turbulent flow</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.240" end="01:37:27.670" style="s2">rather than laminar flow breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.040" end="01:37:31.000" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.670" end="01:37:33.310" style="s2">right if people could just do that</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.000" end="01:37:34.960" style="s2">towards coherence if they could just</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.310" end="01:37:41.080" style="s2">give the benefit of the doubt that each</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.960" end="01:37:42.520" style="s2">other that everyone has some signal even</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.080" end="01:37:43.990" style="s2">if it&#39;s on a very different part of</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.520" end="01:37:46.240" style="s2">reality than the part they&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.990" end="01:37:49.080" style="s2">and even if there&#39;s noise involved and</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.240" end="01:37:51.700" style="s2">they&#39;re listening for the signal first</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.080" end="01:37:52.630" style="s2">that would change everything that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.700" end="01:37:54.730" style="s2">starting place</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.630" end="01:37:55.630" style="s2">so Daniel expresses something and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.730" end="01:37:57.550" style="s2">see he&#39;s trying to suppose something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.630" end="01:38:00.330" style="s2">hard which by the way the rule make is</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.550" end="01:38:01.930" style="s2">designed for that kind of a thing like</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.330" end="01:38:03.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested in having</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.930" end="01:38:05.710" style="s2">conversations that aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.010" end="01:38:07.120" style="s2">trying to break new ground so okay do it</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.710" end="01:38:10.750" style="s2">dude so you expressing something hard</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.120" end="01:38:12.820" style="s2">and in the expression ninety-eight</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.750" end="01:38:15.070" style="s2">percent is noise and two percent is</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.820" end="01:38:16.780" style="s2">signal like the chance riff but what</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.070" end="01:38:19.690" style="s2">happens is that my job is to actually do</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.780" end="01:38:21.970" style="s2">two things one hold all of it not just</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.690" end="01:38:22.900" style="s2">say that was that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.970" end="01:38:24.670" style="s2">hundred percent right so I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.900" end="01:38:28.090" style="s2">nuke it hold all of it</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.670" end="01:38:30.820" style="s2">then in my self discernment to what</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.090" end="01:38:32.530" style="s2">degree can i express something back that</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.820" end="01:38:35.460" style="s2">gets rid of the fifty fifty percent that</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.530" end="01:38:38.590" style="s2">is noise so now I&#39;ve got six percent</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.460" end="01:38:39.460" style="s2">signal express it back and of course if</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.590" end="01:38:41.680" style="s2">he can then do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.460" end="01:38:43.420" style="s2">and now you three is even better a more</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.680" end="01:38:44.200" style="s2">profound instrument because you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.420" end="01:38:45.490" style="s2">be bringing a different perspective</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.200" end="01:38:47.410" style="s2">perhaps you can take it and actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.490" end="01:38:49.450" style="s2">zoom in on it down to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.410" end="01:38:49.840" style="s2">actually 50 percent signal that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.450" end="01:38:51.670" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.840" end="01:38:53.200" style="s2">right and so one it&#39;s an invitation to</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.670" end="01:38:54.520" style="s2">say hey we&#39;re trying to do some things</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.200" end="01:38:56.140" style="s2">hard let&#39;s all try to do something</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.520" end="01:39:04.180" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to be willing to take the</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.140" end="01:39:06.940" style="s2">risk of not speaking elegantly and on</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.180" end="01:39:10.600" style="s2">the premise that everyone else is doing</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.940" end="01:39:12.970" style="s2">their absolute level best to hear</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.600" end="01:39:15.010" style="s2">that which is trying to speak itself</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.970" end="01:39:17.350" style="s2">through you and listening in is in</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.010" end="01:39:19.300" style="s2">themselves like oh there it is tone got</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.350" end="01:39:21.760" style="s2">it there&#39;s something beautiful and clear</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.300" end="01:39:23.890" style="s2">there here&#39;s what I heard and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.760" end="01:39:26.380" style="s2">real Omega and there&#39;s a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.890" end="01:39:30.040" style="s2">safety that&#39;s created to be able to try</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.380" end="01:39:31.060" style="s2">out new stuff knowing that we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.040" end="01:39:32.770" style="s2">trying out new stuff and we&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.060" end="01:39:34.330" style="s2">the benefit of the doubt so it actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.770" end="01:39:37.090" style="s2">does become more explorative and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.330" end="01:39:38.350" style="s2">where you get more novelty and then I</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.090" end="01:39:39.610" style="s2">imagine I don&#39;t know if this is true for</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.350" end="01:39:40.960" style="s2">Daniel I imagine it&#39;s true for you but</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.610" end="01:39:41.860" style="s2">certainly if it&#39;s true for me is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.960" end="01:39:44.020" style="s2">I&#39;m also noticing</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.860" end="01:39:45.610" style="s2">myself like this constant you know when</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.020" end="01:39:47.380" style="s2">you&#39;re meditating you feel this this</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.610" end="01:39:48.880" style="s2">constant chatter and flow of like all</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.380" end="01:39:51.250" style="s2">the things that are going on internally</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.880" end="01:39:53.619" style="s2">that are either like certain ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.250" end="01:39:55.119" style="s2">popping up or emotional responses some</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.619" end="01:39:56.920" style="s2">of them are like social emotional</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.119" end="01:39:59.170" style="s2">responses some of them are like just</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.920" end="01:40:01.199" style="s2">like I got a P and like being able to</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.170" end="01:40:03.790" style="s2">actually notice all that chatter</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.199" end="01:40:05.619" style="s2">internally and do the disturbing</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.790" end="01:40:07.389" style="s2">interior and say okay of all that</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.619" end="01:40:08.469" style="s2">chatter what&#39;s that it&#39;s actually signal</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.389" end="01:40:10.690" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.469" end="01:40:13.179" style="s2">but listen to all of it you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.690" end="01:40:15.130" style="s2">you&#39;ll make it goes in and out right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.179" end="01:40:17.050" style="s2">listening to myself fully and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.130" end="01:40:18.280" style="s2">listening to the to the others fully and</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.050" end="01:40:20.940" style="s2">trying to use discernment to</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.280" end="01:40:25.900" style="s2">continuously allow that process to turn</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.940" end="01:40:28.570" style="s2">that into gold now there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.900" end="01:40:30.639" style="s2">important distinction that we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.570" end="01:40:31.810" style="s2">something that is different than the way</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.639" end="01:40:34.480" style="s2">that some people think about</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.810" end="01:40:39.940" style="s2">multi-perspective ism which is we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.480" end="01:40:43.420" style="s2">saying I&#39;m not saying all perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.940" end="01:40:45.610" style="s2">are equally valid and I&#39;m also not</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.420" end="01:40:48.610" style="s2">saying that there is no way to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.610" end="01:40:54.540" style="s2">them into higher order understanding I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.610" end="01:40:54.540" style="s2">saying all perspectives have some signal</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.750" end="01:41:00.850" style="s2">generally have some noise and that</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.449" end="01:41:02.440" style="s2">perspective is itself a reduction of</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.850" end="01:41:05.409" style="s2">information on the reality being</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.440" end="01:41:07.570" style="s2">perceived and that&#39;s actually quantum</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.409" end="01:41:10.449" style="s2">foam of it all from just the definition</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.570" end="01:41:13.179" style="s2">actually of observer observing observed</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.449" end="01:41:16.869" style="s2">I can&#39;t to take myself out of reality to</p>

<p begin="01:42:06.510" end="01:42:10.920" style="s2">like an immaturity we have to get over</p>

<p begin="01:43:16.800" end="01:43:19.680" style="s2">paradigm is able to grasp things in a</p>

<p begin="01:43:24.150" end="01:43:28.080" style="s2">that by virtue of getting more and more</p>

<p begin="01:43:28.080" end="01:43:34.590" style="s2">have more possibility of having some</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.330" end="01:43:37.860" style="s2">insight and it&#39;s the insight is the key</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.590" end="01:43:40.680" style="s2">not the sense so you&#39;re actually going</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.860" end="01:43:46.050" style="s2">from sense making into insight which is</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.680" end="01:43:48.450" style="s2">very different meanings you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.050" end="01:43:51.140" style="s2">outside in inside out yeah right that</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.450" end="01:43:55.080" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to actually build a</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.140" end="01:43:58.500" style="s2">capacity to be someone who does rather</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.080" end="01:44:00.360" style="s2">than a knowledge you want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.500" end="01:44:02.520" style="s2">know what&#39;s happening you wanna be able</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.360" end="01:44:04.320" style="s2">to respond to what&#39;s happening so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.520" end="01:44:07.590" style="s2">you become a musician by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.320" end="01:44:11.679" style="s2">having a skillful portfolio of</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.590" end="01:44:14.260" style="s2">sensitive qualities in self and then a</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.679" end="01:44:16.300" style="s2">skillful mapping of that into expression</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.260" end="01:44:17.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t become a musician by being</p>

<p begin="01:44:17.500" end="01:44:25.389" style="s2">music so there&#39;s something the thing</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.559" end="01:44:26.949" style="s2">that I was actually saying that I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.389" end="01:44:32.260" style="s2">to add to the conversation has to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.949" end="01:44:35.860" style="s2">with the rival risk nature of ego so</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.260" end="01:44:38.320" style="s2">like when you talk about falling out of</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.860" end="01:44:39.730" style="s2">it the fact that we exist within a macro</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.320" end="01:44:42.460" style="s2">economy where we have private balance</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.730" end="01:44:43.809" style="s2">sheets and our balance sheets are rival</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.460" end="01:44:46.389" style="s2">risk meaning I can advance mine by</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.809" end="01:44:49.030" style="s2">ripping your stuff off and vice versa we</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.389" end="01:44:51.010" style="s2">have we have structural basis for</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.030" end="01:44:52.539" style="s2">rivalry because they involved in a rival</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.010" end="01:44:55.269" style="s2">risk context we have to change that so</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.539" end="01:44:57.489" style="s2">there&#39;s like not just a new sense making</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.269" end="01:44:59.400" style="s2">and culture and experience but also new</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.489" end="01:45:02.289" style="s2">infrastructure and new social structures</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.400" end="01:45:03.309" style="s2">probably beyond the scope of what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.289" end="01:45:05.440" style="s2">get to today</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.309" end="01:45:08.739" style="s2">but even we take the balance sheet away</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.440" end="01:45:10.840" style="s2">there&#39;s the like is someone wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.739" end="01:45:15.550" style="s2">take up more space in the jam session</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.840" end="01:45:17.079" style="s2">because of unmet identity needs and do</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.550" end="01:45:19.329" style="s2">they actually care about the felt</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.079" end="01:45:21.460" style="s2">experience of somebody else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.329" end="01:45:25.090" style="s2">seeking to express something and we</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.460" end="01:45:27.219" style="s2">actually feel do we actually feel each</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.090" end="01:45:28.840" style="s2">other and are we coming from enough</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.219" end="01:45:30.579" style="s2">wholeness that I&#39;m not relating out of</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.840" end="01:45:32.289" style="s2">need most of the time yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.579" end="01:45:34.659" style="s2">musicians call that cutting right like</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.289" end="01:45:37.389" style="s2">it like if somebody deliberately out</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.659" end="01:45:39.389" style="s2">plays the other person and leaves that</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.389" end="01:45:42.219" style="s2">and leaves their contribution diminished</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.389" end="01:45:44.260" style="s2">versus accretive yeah right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.219" end="01:45:45.880" style="s2">cutting sessions and that&#39;s bad for yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.260" end="01:45:47.170" style="s2">yeah yeah so notice you know if we</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.880" end="01:45:48.909" style="s2">switch this domain I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.170" end="01:45:49.989" style="s2">the folks in this side of the camera so</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.909" end="01:45:51.820" style="s2">let&#39;s take this and make this practical</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.989" end="01:45:57.789" style="s2">in the context of sense making in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.820" end="01:45:59.170" style="s2">world we live in right now almost</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.789" end="01:46:00.909" style="s2">everything that we&#39;re talking about if</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.170" end="01:46:02.380" style="s2">you apply it one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.909" end="01:46:05.050" style="s2">notice of course is that all the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.380" end="01:46:10.750" style="s2">that typically goes under the heading of</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.050" end="01:46:14.559" style="s2">sense making is worse than useless so</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.750" end="01:46:16.090" style="s2">any newspaper any news program pretty</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.559" end="01:46:17.469" style="s2">much every scientific paper to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.090" end="01:46:18.730" style="s2">perfectly frank you know we&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.469" end="01:46:20.229" style="s2">analysis isn&#39;t taking a look at how a</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.730" end="01:46:21.760" style="s2">few of them are replicable</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.229" end="01:46:24.369" style="s2">and how much of an incentive structure</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.760" end="01:46:29.829" style="s2">there is for actually lying to be able</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.369" end="01:46:31.059" style="s2">to generate local selective advantage at</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.829" end="01:46:34.300" style="s2">least misinterpreting yeah or</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.059" end="01:46:39.940" style="s2">overstating or whatever it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.300" end="01:46:41.760" style="s2">mess so game a has a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.940" end="01:46:46.090" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.760" end="01:46:47.260" style="s2">broadly speaking waste of time well that</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.090" end="01:46:48.999" style="s2">opens up some very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.260" end="01:46:50.969" style="s2">challenges alright and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.999" end="01:46:55.269" style="s2">the notion of game be being immature</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.969" end="01:46:59.429" style="s2">infantile no zygotic haha</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.269" end="01:47:07.469" style="s2">but where we are now I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.429" end="01:47:15.309" style="s2">holding yourself a feeling of care for</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.469" end="01:47:18.639" style="s2">everything and then truly act and make</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.309" end="01:47:21.099" style="s2">sense in the direction of your actual</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.639" end="01:47:22.539" style="s2">responsibility which I believe has been</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.099" end="01:47:23.639" style="s2">said more elegantly as what does it</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.539" end="01:47:26.229" style="s2">think globally act locally</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.639" end="01:47:28.659" style="s2">just take that seriously like the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.229" end="01:47:30.999" style="s2">reality is is that everybody&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.659" end="01:47:32.260" style="s2">plenty of work to do at home and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.999" end="01:47:35.079" style="s2">trying well this what I&#39;m saying what</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.260" end="01:47:36.789" style="s2">I&#39;m Ryan articulating is that to do this</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.079" end="01:47:38.650" style="s2">thing to come into coherence to play</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.789" end="01:47:40.030" style="s2">game be there&#39;s a lot of work that has</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.650" end="01:47:43.209" style="s2">to be done in the individual in yourself</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.030" end="01:47:44.769" style="s2">and then the way to learn how to do</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.209" end="01:47:45.849" style="s2">coherence is always going to be with</p>

<p begin="01:48:05.320" end="01:48:11.409" style="s2">takes time for sure and it takes doing</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.670" end="01:48:12.760" style="s2">the hard human stuff so you actually</p>

<p begin="01:48:38.920" end="01:48:44.380" style="s2">the path to get there is this path that</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.900" end="01:48:46.030" style="s2">starts here in yourself and moves out in</p>

<p begin="01:49:06.930" end="01:49:14.800" style="s2">emergent coherence is to actually come</p>

<p begin="01:49:28.150" end="01:49:33.070" style="s2">transformative journey in order to</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.370" end="01:49:34.990" style="s2">remember in fact that cow town</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.070" end="01:49:36.040" style="s2">in Kansas is the best place ever and</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.990" end="01:49:37.930" style="s2">there&#39;s no place like home</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.040" end="01:49:39.130" style="s2">nice so you just joined I get it and</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.930" end="01:49:41.560" style="s2">we&#39;re adding those two together it comes</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.130" end="01:49:43.420" style="s2">clear beautiful yeah yeah that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.560" end="01:49:47.350" style="s2">nice it&#39;s very it&#39;s actually odd how</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.420" end="01:49:48.670" style="s2">simple and like plain things are and of</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.350" end="01:49:50.920" style="s2">course what&#39;s interesting is once you</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.670" end="01:49:53.500" style="s2">grasp that once it lands you begin to</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.920" end="01:49:57.160" style="s2">see how the the bigger challenges begin</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.500" end="01:49:58.420" style="s2">to self resolve there&#39;s a point you made</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.160" end="01:50:00.250" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the main point it was a</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.420" end="01:50:04.660" style="s2">tangent but I think it&#39;s super critical</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.250" end="01:50:06.430" style="s2">so I want to emphasize it which is okay</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.660" end="01:50:07.660" style="s2">so why can&#39;t we trust any of the things</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.430" end="01:50:09.040" style="s2">that normally look like sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.660" end="01:50:12.730" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bunch of reasons but</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.040" end="01:50:14.680" style="s2">basically we learn how to do signaling</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.730" end="01:50:17.380" style="s2">for intentional game theoretic purposes</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.680" end="01:50:19.540" style="s2">and so rather than just share signal</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.380" end="01:50:20.860" style="s2">that is true and representative we share</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.540" end="01:50:24.520" style="s2">signal that will advantage some</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.860" end="01:50:30.010" style="s2">rivalries agenda so most signal ends up</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.520" end="01:50:34.450" style="s2">being that and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.010" end="01:50:36.880" style="s2">you were just saying is a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.450" end="01:50:39.910" style="s2">it is that there&#39;s an ethic to not</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.880" end="01:50:41.320" style="s2">up the information ecology right like in</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.910" end="01:50:43.180" style="s2">the same way that we say don&#39;t pollute</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.320" end="01:50:44.380" style="s2">and most people get pretty comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.180" end="01:50:45.090" style="s2">and don&#39;t throw your cigarette butt on</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.380" end="01:50:49.500" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.090" end="01:50:52.200" style="s2">don&#39;t actually dissing form anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.500" end="01:50:54.480" style="s2">for your own getting ahead or withhold</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.200" end="01:50:56.580" style="s2">information where you can avoid doing so</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.480" end="01:50:58.260" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually disempowering</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.580" end="01:51:00.360" style="s2">the sense making of others in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.260" end="01:51:03.120" style="s2">process and to really be tuned into as</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.360" end="01:51:04.860" style="s2">though as I&#39;m seeking to make sense I</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.120" end="01:51:06.420" style="s2">want to increase other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.860" end="01:51:08.010" style="s2">sovereignty in their capacity to make</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.420" end="01:51:09.510" style="s2">sense so I want to increase the</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.010" end="01:51:10.950" style="s2">intactness of the information ecology</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.510" end="01:51:13.260" style="s2">they&#39;re exposed to rather than decrease</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.950" end="01:51:18.870" style="s2">it right up to but not beyond the point</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.260" end="01:51:23.970" style="s2">of boström and those guys info hazards</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.870" end="01:51:28.230" style="s2">yeah-oh to the degree that someone else</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.970" end="01:51:29.760" style="s2">has clearly rival risks agenda with</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.230" end="01:51:31.410" style="s2">regard to information then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.760" end="01:51:32.850" style="s2">factor that in so far as sharing</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.410" end="01:51:36.360" style="s2">information with them within decreased</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.850" end="01:51:37.920" style="s2">sovereignty for lots of people but glue</p>

<p begin="01:54:42.400" end="01:54:46.540" style="s2">so let&#39;s unpack that because so for sure</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.530" end="01:54:48.640" style="s2">you said hey think globally act locally</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.540" end="01:54:50.860" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t scale fast at all</p>

<p begin="01:54:52.720" end="01:55:00.670" style="s2">timelines and then we discussed the</p>

<p begin="01:55:00.670" end="01:55:06.960" style="s2">of politics of suspicion effectively</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.840" end="01:55:09.190" style="s2">right and and the idea that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:55:09.190" end="01:55:13.840" style="s2">the secret with an inner sanctums outer</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.170" end="01:55:15.760" style="s2">sanctums those kind of things I think</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.840" end="01:55:17.830" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly worked in the past for</p>

<p begin="01:55:17.830" end="01:55:20.560" style="s2">potent linear traditions and the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.450" end="01:55:22.990" style="s2">those sort of things there&#39;s there with</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.560" end="01:55:25.380" style="s2">its filters and gates of who had access</p>

<p begin="01:55:32.200" end="01:55:38.650" style="s2">chemists who you know re popularized</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.560" end="01:55:40.750" style="s2">MDMA created a lot of you know design or</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.650" end="01:55:43.330" style="s2">molecules compounds and psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.750" end="01:55:45.250" style="s2">then was collaborating with the DEA and</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.330" end="01:55:46.600" style="s2">then when the DEA looked like they were</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.250" end="01:55:48.430" style="s2">going to be shutting down and repressing</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.600" end="01:55:51.940" style="s2">that information published his two</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.430" end="01:55:53.050" style="s2">cookbooks where he open sourced I said</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.940" end="01:55:56.260" style="s2">this big thing about open sourcing</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.050" end="01:55:58.780" style="s2">versus closed source and he opened</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.260" end="01:56:01.690" style="s2">source all that information now net</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.780" end="01:56:04.000" style="s2">positive on the world but if we use him</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.690" end="01:56:04.510" style="s2">as an example if he went the open source</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.000" end="01:56:07.600" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.510" end="01:56:09.430" style="s2">now you also ended up with street corner</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.600" end="01:56:11.020" style="s2">chemists being able to do things they</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.430" end="01:56:12.730" style="s2">never would have Anila do without his</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.020" end="01:56:14.860" style="s2">two books published you also ended up</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.730" end="01:56:17.610" style="s2">with the advent and rise of and popular</p>

<p begin="01:56:17.610" end="01:56:23.500" style="s2">did Sasha do the right thing should that</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.410" end="01:56:25.270" style="s2">have been kept and cloistered and how</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.500" end="01:56:28.000" style="s2">does the notion of coz I mean the thesis</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.270" end="01:56:30.750" style="s2">of stealing fire was the only shot we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.000" end="01:56:33.670" style="s2">got to avoid weaponization</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.750" end="01:56:36.790" style="s2">commodification or collapse into</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.670" end="01:56:38.380" style="s2">hedonism and particularly the first two</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.790" end="01:56:40.000" style="s2">are just better funded better focused</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.380" end="01:56:43.720" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna beat our asses every time</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.000" end="01:56:46.360" style="s2">is to open source reliable techniques of</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.720" end="01:56:49.210" style="s2">self initiation effectively right and</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.360" end="01:56:51.640" style="s2">ideally in service of coherence faster</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.210" end="01:56:53.650" style="s2">than efforts to capture it and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.640" end="01:56:55.600" style="s2">know whether that&#39;s true and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.650" end="01:56:57.580" style="s2">even know whether that&#39;s wise but that</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.600" end="01:56:59.620" style="s2">was the best idea I had at the</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.580" end="01:57:03.010" style="s2">time so like what did we think about</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.620" end="01:57:05.320" style="s2">that because you could say just dump it</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.010" end="01:57:06.900" style="s2">all out there publish it let the chips</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.320" end="01:57:10.090" style="s2">fall and hope that the Rebel Alliance</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.900" end="01:57:11.620" style="s2">right somehow hangs on to the plans for</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.090" end="01:57:13.180" style="s2">the Death Star ahead of the instead of</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.620" end="01:57:14.500" style="s2">the empire building even better desktop</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.180" end="01:57:18.000" style="s2">what I was thinking as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.500" end="01:57:19.840" style="s2">that was Lou tick she&#39;s dead metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.000" end="01:57:21.280" style="s2">while the stuff was going through me as</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.840" end="01:57:22.600" style="s2">you were as you were talking and one of</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.280" end="01:57:26.200" style="s2">the things that came to me was</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.600" end="01:57:28.990" style="s2">I feel reasonably confident that there</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.200" end="01:57:32.530" style="s2">are in fact things that are appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.990" end="01:57:34.560" style="s2">to being open source we actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.530" end="01:57:36.730" style="s2">mentioned one earlier discernment so</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.560" end="01:57:40.270" style="s2">discernment is the sort of thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.730" end="01:57:42.700" style="s2">somehow now just uncapturable it&#39;s anti</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.270" end="01:57:44.770" style="s2">capturable so two degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.700" end="01:57:46.840" style="s2">somebody actually goes to the process of</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.770" end="01:57:48.820" style="s2">building their discernment they are in</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.840" end="01:57:51.340" style="s2">fact more likely to become an ally than</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.820" end="01:57:55.560" style="s2">they would otherwise have been for</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.340" end="01:57:58.540" style="s2">example and so the Rebel Alliance</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.560" end="01:57:59.980" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be building or outsourced in</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.540" end="01:58:02.890" style="s2">our open sourcing plans on building</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.980" end="01:58:04.240" style="s2">Death Star&#39;s they should be building an</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.890" end="01:58:06.730" style="s2">open sourcing plans on how to build a</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.240" end="01:58:08.710" style="s2">Rebel Alliance so that if the import</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.730" end="01:58:10.060" style="s2">what about lightsabers hold on it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.710" end="01:58:12.100" style="s2">so if the Empire gets a hold of the</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.060" end="01:58:13.390" style="s2">plans all that happens is the Empire</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.100" end="01:58:13.960" style="s2">becomes more Rebel Alliance unless</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.390" end="01:58:20.080" style="s2">Empire</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.960" end="01:58:22.920" style="s2">so not lightsabers not lightsabers this</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.080" end="01:58:26.080" style="s2">is this is actually really tricky topic</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.920" end="01:58:29.800" style="s2">one relevant concept is the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.080" end="01:58:32.290" style="s2">safe to fail probes and so in you were</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.800" end="01:58:34.900" style="s2">mentioning earlier that the people who</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.290" end="01:58:37.360" style="s2">went into the Arctic like probably most</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.900" end="01:58:38.500" style="s2">of them failed and then some small set</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.360" end="01:58:40.480" style="s2">figured out how to make it and then</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.500" end="01:58:43.270" style="s2">those are the ones that figured it out</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.480" end="01:58:46.690" style="s2">right so and the same with the jazz riff</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.270" end="01:58:48.850" style="s2">where it&#39;s mostly gibberish but some</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.690" end="01:58:52.060" style="s2">beautiful thing comes evolution it has a</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.850" end="01:58:53.350" style="s2">very high fail rate but it&#39;s exploring a</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.060" end="01:58:56.620" style="s2">wide search space and then the things</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.350" end="01:58:57.790" style="s2">that make it through are awesome right</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.620" end="01:58:59.410" style="s2">and one of the things you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.790" end="01:59:02.560" style="s2">about timing is can we do an</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.410" end="01:59:05.800" style="s2">evolutionary process factoring the time</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.560" end="01:59:07.990" style="s2">that we have and can we keep allowing</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.800" end="01:59:11.680" style="s2">failure with exponential failure</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.990" end="01:59:13.210" style="s2">possibilities and so the CDC open</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.680" end="01:59:16.600" style="s2">sourcing everything that it knows about</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.210" end="01:59:17.710" style="s2">bioweapons would be stupid because on</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.600" end="01:59:18.970" style="s2">one hand you could say well it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.710" end="01:59:20.290" style="s2">that they&#39;re open sourcing the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.970" end="01:59:22.420" style="s2">so more people can work on protecting</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.290" end="01:59:23.950" style="s2">against it except you actually have more</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.420" end="01:59:27.460" style="s2">capacity for that knowledge to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.950" end="01:59:29.380" style="s2">harmful than to be beneficial and with</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.460" end="01:59:32.680" style="s2">bioweapons or with anything that can be</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.380" end="01:59:34.810" style="s2">weaponized at that scope with AI with</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.680" end="01:59:36.230" style="s2">nanotech with you really have different</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.810" end="01:59:38.970" style="s2">considerations</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.230" end="01:59:43.680" style="s2">because you can&#39;t really control safe to</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.970" end="01:59:45.090" style="s2">fail probes and say so say that again</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.680" end="01:59:48.330" style="s2">like justjust phrase that a different</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.090" end="01:59:51.270" style="s2">way if the worst thing that can happen</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.330" end="01:59:51.930" style="s2">is your jam isn&#39;t that good like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.270" end="01:59:53.820" style="s2">not that bad</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.930" end="01:59:54.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a bummer and you the next thing you</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.820" end="01:59:56.720" style="s2">have a better Jam if the worst thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.990" end="01:59:58.830" style="s2">that happens is you release a</p>

<p begin="01:59:58.830" end="02:00:03.060" style="s2">kills all life you can&#39;t around</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.360" end="02:00:05.040" style="s2">with like playing with that thing and so</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.060" end="02:00:07.410" style="s2">you you actually have to be much more</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.040" end="02:00:10.980" style="s2">careful that if anyone is exploring how</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.410" end="02:00:13.530" style="s2">to create antifragility to that</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.980" end="02:00:16.080" style="s2">knowledge that should be held carefully</p>

<p begin="02:00:55.800" end="02:01:01.950" style="s2">has protocols for group coherence</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.780" end="02:01:04.620" style="s2">there&#39;s more along the lines of remember</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.950" end="02:01:08.940" style="s2">it&#39;s we were trying to cultivate insight</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.620" end="02:01:15.690" style="s2">not teach so it&#39;s there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.940" end="02:01:18.680" style="s2">generate a in individual humans the ins</p>

<p begin="02:01:18.680" end="02:01:28.800" style="s2">themselves build a capacity to come into</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.890" end="02:01:30.990" style="s2">coherence that then does actually come</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.800" end="02:01:32.640" style="s2">into coherence so if you were to be able</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.990" end="02:01:35.670" style="s2">to again the sermon ISM is the canonical</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.640" end="02:01:37.710" style="s2">point the open source determine great</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.670" end="02:01:39.270" style="s2">open source practices and techniques</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.710" end="02:01:41.040" style="s2">that work in the directionality of</p>

<p begin="02:01:41.040" end="02:01:45.150" style="s2">level but I want to go back to something</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.040" end="02:01:47.400" style="s2">you said earlier because I think this</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.150" end="02:01:48.510" style="s2">ends up being quite key you mentioned</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.400" end="02:01:48.750" style="s2">something that about the like the path</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.510" end="02:01:51.780" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.750" end="02:01:52.410" style="s2">relationality doesn&#39;t scale well for me</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.780" end="02:01:54.270" style="s2">with the addition of how a</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.410" end="02:01:56.700" style="s2">supersaturated solution does it phase</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.270" end="02:01:59.520" style="s2">transition to crystallization that I</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.700" end="02:02:01.710" style="s2">think is the answer if you actually do</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.520" end="02:02:03.180" style="s2">this thing where what your your field</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.710" end="02:02:05.850" style="s2">effect which is to say your open source</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.180" end="02:02:08.730" style="s2">broadcast is bringing more and more</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.850" end="02:02:10.860" style="s2">people into a poised state where their</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.730" end="02:02:13.130" style="s2">ability to move into coherence is</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.860" end="02:02:15.830" style="s2">becoming easier and easier and easier</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.130" end="02:02:17.970" style="s2">then when as up happening is that a</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.830" end="02:02:19.980" style="s2">small amount that actually does drop</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.970" end="02:02:21.480" style="s2">into coherence creates a crystallization</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.980" end="02:02:28.110" style="s2">phase transition that could actually</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.480" end="02:02:30.900" style="s2">scale extremely rapidly and has the</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.110" end="02:02:33.930" style="s2">characteristic of being very strong and</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.900" end="02:02:45.900" style="s2">very precise because it&#39;s starting on a</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.930" end="02:02:48.150" style="s2">basis that has no compromise yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.900" end="02:02:49.650" style="s2">think we&#39;re actually I mean it depends</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.150" end="02:02:51.390" style="s2">on how we&#39;re defining coherence and what</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.650" end="02:02:54.690" style="s2">you&#39;re what you&#39;re perceiving as initial</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.390" end="02:02:56.760" style="s2">conditions okay and your question about</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.690" end="02:02:58.260" style="s2">states and stages basically because it</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.760" end="02:02:59.910" style="s2">feels like you&#39;re emphasizing a stage</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.260" end="02:03:01.500" style="s2">based argument which is that it&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.910" end="02:03:04.230" style="s2">it&#39;s hard work and you have to really</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.500" end="02:03:06.990" style="s2">grow and develop into the person that</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.230" end="02:03:08.490" style="s2">can stay really hold coherence and I</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.990" end="02:03:10.740" style="s2">think what I find notice what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.490" end="02:03:12.960" style="s2">tracking I&#39;m like yeah absolutely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.740" end="02:03:15.690" style="s2">the foundational level the springboard</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.960" end="02:03:18.120" style="s2">from which you leap and obviously the</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.690" end="02:03:20.040" style="s2">higher that is the less hops you gotta</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.120" end="02:03:24.870" style="s2">have right to get to the level of</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.040" end="02:03:27.960" style="s2">coherence and between you know smart</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.870" end="02:03:31.260" style="s2">tech pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.960" end="02:03:33.660" style="s2">you know lineage practices like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.260" end="02:03:37.890" style="s2">enough out there these days that you can</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.660" end="02:03:39.870" style="s2">for sure create at least you know like</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.890" end="02:03:42.150" style="s2">the vomit comment you can create moments</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.870" end="02:03:47.220" style="s2">where everybody is weightless you can</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.150" end="02:03:49.110" style="s2">create a a transient group coherence</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.220" end="02:03:52.590" style="s2">that and there&#39;s it&#39;s a bell curve</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.110" end="02:03:54.570" style="s2">distribution from what I can tell 10% of</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.590" end="02:03:56.010" style="s2">the people lose their don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.570" end="02:03:57.210" style="s2">what to do with that space or you know</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.010" end="02:04:00.060" style="s2">in maybe it&#39;s like 10 it could be more</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.210" end="02:04:00.900" style="s2">but like to say tails you got you got</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.060" end="02:04:02.790" style="s2">the people who</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.900" end="02:04:07.320" style="s2">and lose their and then you got the</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.790" end="02:04:10.170" style="s2">people it doesn&#39;t budge at all and those</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.320" end="02:04:12.420" style="s2">are the psychopaths and they should not</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.170" end="02:04:14.130" style="s2">have been exposed to this and then</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.420" end="02:04:16.469" style="s2">there&#39;s the bell curve in the middle who</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.130" end="02:04:18.090" style="s2">were like oh wow you know the Omega</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.469" end="02:04:20.130" style="s2">principle like oh wow</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.090" end="02:04:23.040" style="s2">I&#39;m an organism I&#39;m in here I&#39;m an AI</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.130" end="02:04:25.679" style="s2">holy we&#39;re seeing in parallax this</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.040" end="02:04:30.690" style="s2">is joyful wondrous amazing</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.679" end="02:04:35.850" style="s2">transformative and so what do we do with</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.690" end="02:04:38.429" style="s2">that I&#39;d like to enter topic we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.850" end="02:04:43.350" style="s2">talked about yet which is the what Trust</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.429" end="02:04:49.580" style="s2">is to coherence it was mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.350" end="02:04:54.770" style="s2">not defecting and so one model that I</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.580" end="02:04:54.770" style="s2">just used personally for trust is I</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.100" end="02:05:01.380" style="s2">trust people as much as I trust them in</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.440" end="02:05:02.880" style="s2">their worst states yeah yeah because if</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.380" end="02:05:04.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a bell curve distribution on the</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.880" end="02:05:08.580" style="s2">states of behavior they&#39;re gonna go into</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.770" end="02:05:09.960" style="s2">maybe which is for most people pretty</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.580" end="02:05:12.659" style="s2">coupled to their emotional states</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.960" end="02:05:13.860" style="s2">unfortunately right I want to uncouple</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.659" end="02:05:15.179" style="s2">those so that even if someone&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.860" end="02:05:16.890" style="s2">shitty emotional state they don&#39;t behave</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.179" end="02:05:19.860" style="s2">shittily that they can witness it and</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.890" end="02:05:22.650" style="s2">not act on it right like I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.860" end="02:05:25.860" style="s2">fetal position right now no smashing and</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.650" end="02:05:27.600" style="s2">crashing things right and then I want to</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.860" end="02:05:29.219" style="s2">help what makes them go into the</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.600" end="02:05:31.350" style="s2">shittiest emotional states which is</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.219" end="02:05:33.659" style="s2">trauma and meaning making patterns I</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.350" end="02:05:35.420" style="s2">want to help heal that right so they</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.659" end="02:05:38.340" style="s2">don&#39;t go into a shitty States as often</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.420" end="02:05:40.739" style="s2">but then also decouple their internal</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.340" end="02:05:45.150" style="s2">state from their behavior but if if</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.739" end="02:05:47.250" style="s2">someone mmm sometimes takes information</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.150" end="02:05:49.409" style="s2">I share with them and uses it in really</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.250" end="02:05:50.790" style="s2">synergistic ways and generally it is at</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.409" end="02:05:54.090" style="s2">least discerning but when they&#39;re pissed</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.790" end="02:05:54.960" style="s2">off uses it as a weapon against me but</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.090" end="02:05:57.360" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.960" end="02:06:00.960" style="s2">well I can&#39;t share certain things with</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.360" end="02:06:03.449" style="s2">them right so there is raising the floor</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.960" end="02:06:05.310" style="s2">of the shittiest behavior you allow of</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.449" end="02:06:08.670" style="s2">yourself in relationship that makes you</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.310" end="02:06:10.980" style="s2">more trustworthy that is actually really</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.670" end="02:06:12.370" style="s2">at the heart of our ability to have anti</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.980" end="02:06:14.440" style="s2">fragile coherence</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.370" end="02:06:15.850" style="s2">that says you know what no matter how</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.440" end="02:06:17.020" style="s2">upset with you I am there are certain</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.850" end="02:06:19.630" style="s2"> of things I&#39;m just never going to</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.020" end="02:06:21.700" style="s2">do as my own standard for myself and</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.630" end="02:06:22.990" style="s2">then part of our discernment is to also</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.700" end="02:06:25.000" style="s2">be able to pay attention to where</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.990" end="02:06:26.950" style="s2">someone is not just in their highest</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.000" end="02:06:29.350" style="s2">states after the state induction methods</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.950" end="02:06:30.820" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about but where they are</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.350" end="02:06:32.440" style="s2">in the shitty parts and one of the</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.820" end="02:06:35.290" style="s2">things I&#39;m really interested in is not</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.440" end="02:06:36.970" style="s2">just making people&#39;s highest state&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.290" end="02:06:38.740" style="s2">higher well what brings them into their</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.970" end="02:06:40.330" style="s2">shittiest states is still anchored and</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.740" end="02:06:42.670" style="s2">now they they actually have a wider</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.330" end="02:06:45.010" style="s2">space to reconcile and they can even get</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.670" end="02:06:47.170" style="s2">bipolar about it it happens a lot yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.010" end="02:06:51.490" style="s2">want to help clean this stuff up for</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.170" end="02:06:53.130" style="s2">sure and it&#39;s recursive I was landing</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.490" end="02:06:57.280" style="s2">there as well I was thinking okay so</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.130" end="02:06:58.360" style="s2">state and stage obviously for me the</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.280" end="02:07:02.440" style="s2">first thing that comes up in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.360" end="02:07:04.000" style="s2">state is there&#39;s the constant recurrence</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.440" end="02:07:05.170" style="s2">of the trap of taking the state for the</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.000" end="02:07:06.460" style="s2">stage all right so let&#39;s carefully</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.170" end="02:07:08.320" style="s2">partition them and say okay they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.460" end="02:07:09.970" style="s2">and to the degree to which you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.320" end="02:07:12.550" style="s2">to burn him in and take taking drugs you</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.970" end="02:07:14.140" style="s2">are not in fact actually else anywhere</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.550" end="02:07:15.370" style="s2">but maybe you saw Michael imps that</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.140" end="02:07:15.850" style="s2">there is somewhere else to go that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.370" end="02:07:19.300" style="s2">neat</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.850" end="02:07:22.120" style="s2">so very carefully so the first is big</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.300" end="02:07:23.530" style="s2">red flag state is not staged the state</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.120" end="02:07:27.370" style="s2">is not going to get you to stage by</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.530" end="02:07:29.440" style="s2">itself take it slow okay so then what</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.370" end="02:07:30.850" style="s2">happens in state and as I was kind of</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.440" end="02:07:33.640" style="s2">just again for some first-person</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.850" end="02:07:35.080" style="s2">experience well a lot of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.640" end="02:07:37.300" style="s2">we were talking about in terms of what</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.080" end="02:07:40.480" style="s2">given individual has to actually be able</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.300" end="02:07:42.580" style="s2">to come into to be able to start</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.480" end="02:07:45.130" style="s2">participating in a direct collaboration</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.580" end="02:07:47.890" style="s2">and getting to stage in my experience</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.130" end="02:07:50.230" style="s2">actually happened in States I you want</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.890" end="02:07:52.770" style="s2">to try to heal trauma trauma healing can</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.230" end="02:07:55.900" style="s2">happen very well with say psychedelics</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.770" end="02:07:57.400" style="s2">art of transparent mind really really</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.900" end="02:08:01.060" style="s2">effectively supported by certain kinds</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.400" end="02:08:02.080" style="s2">of ecstatic states so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.060" end="02:08:03.640" style="s2">things I think I think if you actually</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.080" end="02:08:05.830" style="s2">take the state and think of it as an</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.640" end="02:08:08.680" style="s2">instrument they can be pointed at</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.830" end="02:08:11.830" style="s2">particular capacities that can be moved</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.680" end="02:08:14.020" style="s2">into stage because or through the use of</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.830" end="02:08:15.670" style="s2">that so how do I use a particular state</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.020" end="02:08:17.620" style="s2">experience to actually develop men to</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.670" end="02:08:20.680" style="s2">the level up a stage in my personal</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.620" end="02:08:23.110" style="s2">development and just have iterations</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.680" end="02:08:25.090" style="s2">there then I think we&#39;re good then I</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.110" end="02:08:26.050" style="s2">think it works very nicely but we know</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.090" end="02:08:27.850" style="s2">where the center is</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.050" end="02:08:30.640" style="s2">here we want to develop mature human</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.850" end="02:08:32.260" style="s2">beings and there are many many different</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.640" end="02:08:34.360" style="s2">state experiences that are part of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.260" end="02:08:35.620" style="s2">process of doing that many of which we</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.360" end="02:08:37.270" style="s2">have to use now because our</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.620" end="02:08:38.890" style="s2">developmental environment so us</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.270" end="02:08:40.330" style="s2">up that we&#39;re gonna have to use some</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.890" end="02:08:44.080" style="s2">pretty interesting tools to break stuff</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.330" end="02:08:45.550" style="s2">out yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.080" end="02:08:47.380" style="s2">I mean that would be my sense as well</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.550" end="02:08:51.790" style="s2">it&#39;s just that they are it is a</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.380" end="02:08:55.290" style="s2">beautiful thing that a peak state that</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.790" end="02:08:59.740" style="s2">creates safety security connection</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.290" end="02:09:02.650" style="s2">insight belonging can lend itself very</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.740" end="02:09:05.440" style="s2">strongly to to be the fuel source for</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.650" end="02:09:06.790" style="s2">deep anything we see this with MDMA PTSD</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.440" end="02:09:08.230" style="s2">therapy and a bunch of other things but</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.790" end="02:09:10.660" style="s2">it basically allows you to go back and</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.230" end="02:09:13.090" style="s2">reformat and reintegrate places that are</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.660" end="02:09:16.060" style="s2">currently wounded or traumatized and</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.090" end="02:09:20.530" style="s2">that we do that in relationship with</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.060" end="02:09:22.660" style="s2">others tightens trust tightens bonds and</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.530" end="02:09:25.150" style="s2">then further creates the capacity for us</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.660" end="02:09:28.060" style="s2">to learn to play well with each other</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.150" end="02:09:30.310" style="s2">through all those stages which you know</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.060" end="02:09:32.700" style="s2">surfacer if we can learn to share states</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.310" end="02:09:36.090" style="s2">well with each other and experience</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.700" end="02:09:40.480" style="s2">momentary coherence momentary</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.090" end="02:09:43.380" style="s2">transpersonal sense making and be in in</p>

<p begin="02:09:43.380" end="02:09:48.040" style="s2">supporting each other you know that in</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.670" end="02:09:51.070" style="s2">the the linkage between those two is the</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.040" end="02:09:53.050" style="s2">community oz is like you know to me it</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.070" end="02:09:54.940" style="s2">feels like this you know nothing new</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.050" end="02:09:56.410" style="s2">Under the Sun kind of but like if</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.940" end="02:09:57.880" style="s2">you think of like gospel churches you</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.410" end="02:09:59.230" style="s2">know coming out of the African American</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.880" end="02:10:03.040" style="s2">slave experience it&#39;s like there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.230" end="02:10:05.260" style="s2">sense of they are perfectly designed you</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.040" end="02:10:08.020" style="s2">know vehicles for a lot of this which is</p>

<p begin="02:10:08.020" end="02:10:12.010" style="s2">sealant that the trailer for the new</p>

<p begin="02:10:12.010" end="02:10:15.970" style="s2">like this she did this ripping album</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.870" end="02:10:18.130" style="s2">called Amazing Grace in a Watts Gospel</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.970" end="02:10:19.480" style="s2">Church in like 1974 and then all the</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.130" end="02:10:21.310" style="s2">footage was lost and it&#39;s just come out</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.480" end="02:10:23.290" style="s2">like I literally wept seeing this this</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.310" end="02:10:24.850" style="s2"> trailer was unreal and she</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.290" end="02:10:27.880" style="s2">starts singing the song Amazing Grace</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.850" end="02:10:29.050" style="s2">and she just takes that a and she just</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.880" end="02:10:30.790" style="s2">does her she goes all over the she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.050" end="02:10:33.520" style="s2">like 29 years old at the time and but</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.790" end="02:10:35.260" style="s2">but the Gospel Choir who&#39;s backing her</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.520" end="02:10:36.310" style="s2">up are like giving it up like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.260" end="02:10:37.810" style="s2">feeling the shimmy shakes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.310" end="02:10:39.250" style="s2">feeling the juice they&#39;re giving it up</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.810" end="02:10:39.820" style="s2">for and then they stop praising and</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.250" end="02:10:41.800" style="s2">testify</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.820" end="02:10:44.170" style="s2">like the whole thing just goes through</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.800" end="02:10:45.520" style="s2">the roof and you&#39;re like oh my god and</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.170" end="02:10:47.170" style="s2">then there&#39;s the swaying the clapping</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.520" end="02:10:50.619" style="s2">the dancing the movement and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.170" end="02:10:53.679" style="s2">it is weeping for the humanity of our</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.619" end="02:10:55.659" style="s2">wounding it is praising you know the</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.679" end="02:10:58.239" style="s2">divinity of our possibility and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.659" end="02:11:00.460" style="s2">connecting like literally like church as</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.239" end="02:11:03.310" style="s2">a vote and you&#39;re like ah man we</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.460" end="02:11:05.440" style="s2">got it you know we see the dust that</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.310" end="02:11:08.230" style="s2"> off and like create new versions I</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.440" end="02:11:09.880" style="s2">mean when you imagine the gospel church</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.230" end="02:11:11.980" style="s2">one of the things that makes it so</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.880" end="02:11:15.159" style="s2">powerful is that you&#39;re also noticing it</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.980" end="02:11:17.250" style="s2">is in continuity with a bigger context</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.159" end="02:11:20.530" style="s2">it&#39;s actually part of a real community</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.250" end="02:11:21.699" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s not like you teleport</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.530" end="02:11:24.130" style="s2">to the Gospel Church and then you all</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.699" end="02:11:26.260" style="s2">fly back to your different cities you</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.130" end="02:11:28.150" style="s2">walk out and then you go live with each</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.260" end="02:11:29.560" style="s2">other and it contains the whole of</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.150" end="02:11:31.119" style="s2">humanity it&#39;s got little kids and</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.560" end="02:11:33.880" style="s2">grandmas it&#39;s got grandpas it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.119" end="02:11:36.610" style="s2">whole human family in a single place so</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.880" end="02:11:39.610" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a heuristic if your</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.610" end="02:11:41.280" style="s2">state experience is you and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.610" end="02:11:43.570" style="s2">other 20-something rich white people</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.280" end="02:11:44.619" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not right something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.570" end="02:11:45.760" style="s2">probably off about that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.619" end="02:11:47.889" style="s2">something gonna be missing if it</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.760" end="02:11:49.840" style="s2">contains the whole of humanity turistic</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.889" end="02:11:53.619" style="s2">right not ideology heuristic this you</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.840" end="02:11:55.960" style="s2">know it&#39;s a and you know across</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.619" end="02:11:58.929" style="s2">different a whole community if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.960" end="02:12:01.780" style="s2">continuity if the group is spontaneously</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.929" end="02:12:03.310" style="s2">getting together in bali and then</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.780" end="02:12:04.210" style="s2">everybody&#39;s flying back to their West</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.310" end="02:12:07.690" style="s2">Coast East Coast</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.210" end="02:12:09.250" style="s2">flyover cities again probably not gonna</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.690" end="02:12:11.619" style="s2">get the thing done if on the other hand</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.250" end="02:12:13.570" style="s2">you&#39;re already living in community and</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.619" end="02:12:17.530" style="s2">the state experiences supporting a</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.570" end="02:12:19.659" style="s2">deeper communitas that is lived 24/7</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.530" end="02:12:21.670" style="s2">okay that&#39;s more likely to work so it</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.659" end="02:12:24.579" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re adding state stage in</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.670" end="02:12:26.889" style="s2">place enduring enduring continuity</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.579" end="02:12:29.290" style="s2">wholeness all right think of it think of</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.889" end="02:12:30.280" style="s2">it as part of a whole continuous process</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.290" end="02:12:31.060" style="s2">and then of course what happens is you</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.280" end="02:12:33.849" style="s2">get all kinds of interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.060" end="02:12:35.679" style="s2">because now you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.849" end="02:12:36.909" style="s2">as your particulars you&#39;re talking is</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.679" end="02:12:37.960" style="s2">likely this really interesting thing</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.909" end="02:12:39.880" style="s2">like okay what are the failure</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.960" end="02:12:42.070" style="s2">conditions in the efforts to go here</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.880" end="02:12:43.210" style="s2">again like where does it fail and one of</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.070" end="02:12:46.239" style="s2">the ones was really interesting is like</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.210" end="02:12:50.409" style="s2">the difference between makalah gluing</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.239" end="02:12:52.059" style="s2">together analytics and true synthesis so</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.409" end="02:12:53.559" style="s2">gluing together analytics is this thing</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.059" end="02:12:55.359" style="s2">we&#39;re like okay I&#39;ve got one piece trans</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.559" end="02:12:56.769" style="s2">paramedic of mine I&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.359" end="02:12:58.149" style="s2">pieces that I&#39;ve worked really really</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.769" end="02:13:01.959" style="s2">good in my yoga practice to be able to</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.149" end="02:13:03.280" style="s2">feel peaceful I got another piece where</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.959" end="02:13:04.599" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken a whole lot of drugs to get</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.280" end="02:13:06.339" style="s2">this a bunch of people so we really feel</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.599" end="02:13:08.109" style="s2">close and we work some stuff out of her</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.339" end="02:13:09.519" style="s2">over ayahuasca and then I&#39;m gonna do is</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.109" end="02:13:11.260" style="s2">kind of like put these in the same space</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.519" end="02:13:12.489" style="s2">and pretend that by sticking them</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.260" end="02:13:14.919" style="s2">together really hard I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.489" end="02:13:16.119" style="s2">achieved some new synthesis in fact what</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.919" end="02:13:17.800" style="s2">I have is I have three distinct things</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.119" end="02:13:20.199" style="s2">that aren&#39;t actually actually integrated</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.800" end="02:13:23.169" style="s2">so it&#39;s the difference between a puzzle</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.199" end="02:13:25.719" style="s2">and a photograph or even a puzzle and a</p>

<p begin="02:15:51.619" end="02:15:53.630" style="s2">mean obviously you&#39;re talking you were</p>

<p begin="02:17:45.599" end="02:17:48.479" style="s2">toward the water hole is you&#39;ll it</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.920" end="02:17:49.679" style="s2">up for me or whatever it is then I want</p>

<p begin="02:17:49.679" end="02:17:55.170" style="s2">I also want to dis inform you and tell</p>

<p begin="02:19:19.859" end="02:19:23.909" style="s2">fact just lived relationally it&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.229" end="02:19:26.909" style="s2">that&#39;s why landmark is bigger than the</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.909" end="02:19:28.679" style="s2">pasta right I mean they&#39;ve gone they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.909" end="02:19:30.719" style="s2">gone they&#39;ve diluted to the lowest</p>

<p begin="02:19:30.719" end="02:19:33.200" style="s2">about putting people</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.820" end="02:19:34.340" style="s2">exposed vulnerable states and upselling</p>
<p begin="02:19:33.200" end="02:19:37.370" style="s2">and living up yeah it is</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.340" end="02:19:39.560" style="s2">transactional yeah there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.370" end="02:19:41.360" style="s2">problems if it&#39;s broadcast there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.560" end="02:19:43.280" style="s2">be problems I just have to speak to it</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.360" end="02:19:44.240" style="s2">irony of us talking about this on</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.280" end="02:19:46.340" style="s2">broadcast</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.240" end="02:19:48.620" style="s2">fortunately three white men specifically</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.340" end="02:19:50.170" style="s2">within about roughly the same age I</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.620" end="02:19:51.980" style="s2">think we&#39;re actually the same person</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.170" end="02:19:53.320" style="s2">well I think the beauty of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.980" end="02:19:55.431" style="s2">happening though is that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.320" end="02:19:56.960" style="s2">unlikely that anybody&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.431" end="02:19:58.431" style="s2">to watch this video because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.960" end="02:20:02.471" style="s2">incomprehensible and just hard to follow</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.431" end="02:20:02.471" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s actually not a problem</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.011" end="02:20:06.620" style="s2">the with Tinchy answer is kind of</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.330" end="02:20:10.490" style="s2">thinking about that in terms of like the</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.620" end="02:20:12.261" style="s2">meta is to degree to which this is</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.490" end="02:20:13.910" style="s2">actually interesting at all what I would</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.261" end="02:20:17.120" style="s2">say is that this is genuinely just a</p>
<p begin="02:20:13.910" end="02:20:18.950" style="s2">conversation this is I mean for those</p>
<p begin="02:20:17.120" end="02:20:20.840" style="s2">who happen to be watching this is</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.950" end="02:20:24.101" style="s2">straight-up just exactly what a</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.840" end="02:20:26.870" style="s2">conversation as up as that is</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.101" end="02:20:29.061" style="s2">what we talk about and this is no</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.870" end="02:20:30.141" style="s2">different as far as I can tell I mean</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.061" end="02:20:32.061" style="s2">I&#39;ve had conversations are both of you</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.141" end="02:20:37.070" style="s2">in some conversations the three of us</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.061" end="02:20:39.410" style="s2">together I mean me a little bit more</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.070" end="02:20:41.301" style="s2">formal but not a lot I think was a</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.410" end="02:20:42.530" style="s2">slower start up like we cut it there was</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.301" end="02:20:45.380" style="s2">a little bit of that&#39;s right we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.530" end="02:20:47.811" style="s2">jump into it but this is more or less</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.380" end="02:20:50.931" style="s2">just water conversation with us is like</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.811" end="02:20:52.221" style="s2">so but your point I think is quite quite</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.931" end="02:20:53.931" style="s2">nice okay cool so what do we do</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.221" end="02:20:57.590" style="s2">heuristics like how do we actually</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.931" end="02:20:59.391" style="s2">prevent this from creating unintended</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.590" end="02:21:00.740" style="s2">negative consequences so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.391" end="02:21:04.580" style="s2">something I wanted to enter in that I</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.740" end="02:21:06.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t yet and this was coming in it</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.580" end="02:21:07.851" style="s2">from a completely oblique direction of</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.080" end="02:21:09.950" style="s2">anything we&#39;ve talked about so far but</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.851" end="02:21:13.040" style="s2">it has to do with what the motive for us</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.950" end="02:21:14.721" style="s2">doing any of it is for doing any doing</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.040" end="02:21:17.960" style="s2">actually and so it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.721" end="02:21:22.250" style="s2">nature of desire and this is something I</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.960" end="02:21:25.221" style="s2">I find really fascinating if you look at</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.250" end="02:21:27.110" style="s2">the beginning of if you look at Buddha&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.221" end="02:21:32.480" style="s2">Noble Truths and desire as the source of</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.110" end="02:21:34.570" style="s2">all suffering and as kind of a essential</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.480" end="02:21:38.000" style="s2">Eastern teaching and then you look at</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.570" end="02:21:40.820" style="s2">desire as the cause of passion and</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.000" end="02:21:43.400" style="s2">creativity in Western teaching there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.820" end="02:21:44.590" style="s2">really big dialectic between those</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.400" end="02:21:45.700" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of worth</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.590" end="02:21:49.149" style="s2">navigating and there&#39;s some deep</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.700" end="02:21:52.960" style="s2">ontology as to why and why I model those</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.149" end="02:21:54.370" style="s2">differences and so in a Western model</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.960" end="02:21:58.240" style="s2">made in the image and likeness of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.370" end="02:22:01.750" style="s2">Creator be creative and desire is the</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.240" end="02:22:03.420" style="s2">source of the imagined more beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.750" end="02:22:06.220" style="s2">rich future for us to be creative right</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.420" end="02:22:07.660" style="s2">Eastern model it has us disconnect from</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.220" end="02:22:10.120" style="s2">the fullness of the moment to imagine</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.660" end="02:22:11.620" style="s2">that a future moment could be more full</p>
<p begin="02:22:10.120" end="02:22:13.390" style="s2">and it actually makes us feverish and</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.620" end="02:22:14.920" style="s2"> up and then when we get it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.390" end="02:22:16.500" style="s2">only happy for like a moment and then we</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.920" end="02:22:19.270" style="s2">want something else</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.500" end="02:22:21.609" style="s2">Eastern model focused on being which</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.270" end="02:22:23.979" style="s2">happens in the moment Western model has</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.609" end="02:22:25.899" style="s2">a model of time that is reified focused</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.979" end="02:22:27.189" style="s2">on doing and becoming which is fulfilled</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.899" end="02:22:28.390" style="s2">in the future and so of course I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.189" end="02:22:30.160" style="s2">happy for a moment that I want something</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.390" end="02:22:33.250" style="s2">else because becoming is actually what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.160" end="02:22:36.310" style="s2">relevant becoming more and more full one</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.250" end="02:22:40.120" style="s2">way I think about this is if I think</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.310" end="02:22:42.790" style="s2">about desire as like voltage right like</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.120" end="02:22:46.870" style="s2">a pressure or a gradient for flow a</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.790" end="02:22:48.790" style="s2">basis for movement I can think about the</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.870" end="02:22:51.160" style="s2">low gradient inside of me in the high</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.790" end="02:22:52.870" style="s2">gradient in the world some some lack or</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.160" end="02:22:54.600" style="s2">emptiness and myself that creates a</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.870" end="02:22:58.060" style="s2">desire to get something from the world</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.600" end="02:23:03.600" style="s2">get recognition get money get sex get</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.060" end="02:23:07.180" style="s2">attention get something right and I</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.600" end="02:23:09.760" style="s2">think that Buddha was right to say that</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.180" end="02:23:12.850" style="s2">that is the cause of or at least related</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.760" end="02:23:15.520" style="s2">with suffering and it&#39;s kind of like to</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.850" end="02:23:18.490" style="s2">the degree that I am affirming a sense</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.520" end="02:23:20.189" style="s2">of self that is in lack I get more of</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.490" end="02:23:22.450" style="s2">that sense of self to those who have</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.189" end="02:23:23.800" style="s2">more shall be given to those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.450" end="02:23:26.380" style="s2">have the little they have shall be taken</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.800" end="02:23:28.120" style="s2">away biblical quote but we&#39;re having is</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.380" end="02:23:31.030" style="s2">like a state of experience a state of</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.120" end="02:23:32.740" style="s2">consciousness so then there is a</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.030" end="02:23:35.350" style="s2">different kind of desire that is not</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.740" end="02:23:38.140" style="s2">just no orientation for movement which</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.350" end="02:23:41.350" style="s2">is an inner fullness that actually has a</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.140" end="02:23:43.060" style="s2">imperative to flow into the world so</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.350" end="02:23:44.800" style="s2">there is a desire and there&#39;s a basis</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.060" end="02:23:47.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually coming from wholeness</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.800" end="02:23:49.960" style="s2">not from unholiness is that Molly Bob</p>

<p begin="02:24:34.890" end="02:24:41.319" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah it&#39;s such an interesting</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.270" end="02:24:44.260" style="s2">thing like the yeah I agree with you</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.319" end="02:24:46.810" style="s2">that that teaching is which is say</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.260" end="02:24:48.399" style="s2">useful and works that there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="02:24:46.810" end="02:24:52.950" style="s2">actually recognize that you are capable</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.399" end="02:24:55.359" style="s2">of being full with simply yourself</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.950" end="02:24:58.390" style="s2">there&#39;s no need to have something from</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.359" end="02:25:02.109" style="s2">the outside to fulfill but rather</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.390" end="02:25:05.350" style="s2">through doing something in self and then</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.109" end="02:25:06.430" style="s2">when you&#39;re in that place ah this is</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.350" end="02:25:09.000" style="s2">actually very similar to what you were</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.430" end="02:25:11.859" style="s2">talking about when you talked about the</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.000" end="02:25:13.300" style="s2">the least city to the most to the when</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.859" end="02:25:16.750" style="s2">there is a high low there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.300" end="02:25:22.569" style="s2">okay a way of developing self so as to</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.750" end="02:25:24.450" style="s2">be able to even when the interior the</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.569" end="02:25:28.479" style="s2">self is actually lacking in some way</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.450" end="02:25:29.680" style="s2">still to relate to that as full because</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.479" end="02:25:32.819" style="s2">the reality is is you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.680" end="02:25:36.460" style="s2">need that much very very little really</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.819" end="02:25:39.399" style="s2">minuscule amount really particularly in</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.460" end="02:25:41.319" style="s2">contemporary environment and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.399" end="02:25:42.490" style="s2">a disposition that can be achieved which</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.319" end="02:25:44.200" style="s2">is nice like there&#39;s a disposition that</p>

<p begin="02:25:44.200" end="02:25:50.319" style="s2">where that gradient form desire is not</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.800" end="02:25:52.109" style="s2">have much traction it does not pull for</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.319" end="02:25:54.670" style="s2">me at least I can constantly feel it</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.109" end="02:25:58.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a pole but does not have much</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.670" end="02:25:59.470" style="s2">pull and I should mention by the way for</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.270" end="02:26:01.600" style="s2">me at least the training has also been</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.470" end="02:26:04.840" style="s2">having a noticing when it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.600" end="02:26:05.950" style="s2">build I&#39;m thirsty now okay well I better</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.840" end="02:26:07.859" style="s2">take care of that that actually is</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.950" end="02:26:10.510" style="s2">something that needs to be an actual</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.859" end="02:26:10.990" style="s2">conscious choice to satisfy I need now</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.510" end="02:26:13.540" style="s2">this is the</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.990" end="02:26:16.061" style="s2">thing with your focus on sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.540" end="02:26:19.210" style="s2">starting at home that is so critical is</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.061" end="02:26:21.490" style="s2">because if I&#39;m not tending to my own</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.210" end="02:26:22.811" style="s2">wholeness I I actually can&#39;t do any of</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.490" end="02:26:24.610" style="s2">the stuff we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.811" end="02:26:26.950" style="s2">exactly and then and then what happens</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.610" end="02:26:29.260" style="s2">is in my experiences that is that every</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.950" end="02:26:33.280" style="s2">human being I&#39;ve ever encountered is a</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.260" end="02:26:35.740" style="s2">cup overflowing provided we&#39;re resourced</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.280" end="02:26:39.250" style="s2">right so my sense would be is that is</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.740" end="02:26:40.960" style="s2">that you were describing some element of</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.250" end="02:26:42.101" style="s2">like well if you&#39;re Buddha writing</p>
<p begin="02:26:40.960" end="02:26:43.630" style="s2">you&#39;re completely understanding and</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.101" end="02:26:45.250" style="s2">you&#39;re purely coming from being you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.630" end="02:26:48.221" style="s2">integrated that relation the constant</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.250" end="02:26:49.750" style="s2">you know dialectic between being and</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.221" end="02:26:50.860" style="s2">becoming then that&#39;s how you play the</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.750" end="02:26:52.330" style="s2">game but like you were talking about</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.860" end="02:26:55.660" style="s2">culture architecture and how do we</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.330" end="02:26:59.530" style="s2">actually get humans in culture and in</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.660" end="02:27:01.811" style="s2">game a with all the traumas of life how</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.530" end="02:27:05.200" style="s2">are we helping us you know walk each</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.811" end="02:27:07.721" style="s2">other home then I just keep coming back</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.200" end="02:27:10.210" style="s2">to that ocean notion of you know that</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.721" end="02:27:13.980" style="s2">gospel church which is the idea like if</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.210" end="02:27:18.670" style="s2">we can have momentary provisional</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.980" end="02:27:21.250" style="s2">transient experiences of coherence right</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.670" end="02:27:24.880" style="s2">Church you know the Holy Ghost feeling</p>
<p begin="02:27:21.250" end="02:27:27.010" style="s2">right and we can use that as metronome</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.880" end="02:27:28.840" style="s2">oh yes I was off the one and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.010" end="02:27:30.971" style="s2">back on the one right I remember</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.840" end="02:27:33.010" style="s2">and a tuning fork oh I was banged and</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.971" end="02:27:35.771" style="s2">scraped this week but man I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.010" end="02:27:38.170" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve sweat my prayers I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.771" end="02:27:41.380" style="s2">whatever I&#39;ve done and then training</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.170" end="02:27:44.820" style="s2">wheels now I&#39;d like MDMA therapy right</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.380" end="02:27:47.950" style="s2">now I feel resourced I feel love I feel</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.820" end="02:27:50.141" style="s2">connection I feel coherence and now let</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.950" end="02:27:53.170" style="s2">me go and it might lost me the next hour</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.141" end="02:27:54.971" style="s2">it might lost me all a Sunday it might</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.170" end="02:27:57.030" style="s2">lost me to hump day who the hell knows</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.971" end="02:27:59.920" style="s2">but I get a little further each time</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.030" end="02:28:01.510" style="s2">practicing so rather than just we got to</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.920" end="02:28:03.280" style="s2">do a whole bunch of hard slow grooming</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.510" end="02:28:05.260" style="s2">up to develop to the place where we</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.280" end="02:28:07.480" style="s2">might finally get to start practicing</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.260" end="02:28:08.800" style="s2">can we do these in parallel type of gig</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.480" end="02:28:09.340" style="s2">and a:hover talks about that like well</p>
<p begin="02:28:08.800" end="02:28:11.260" style="s2">which is it</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.340" end="02:28:13.150" style="s2">you know the tops down bottoms up gross</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.260" end="02:28:15.700" style="s2">you know anything it&#39;s both because</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.150" end="02:28:17.820" style="s2">that&#39;s how life happens and if but if we</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.700" end="02:28:19.690" style="s2">and I&#39;d feels to me like the peace that</p>
<p begin="02:28:17.820" end="02:28:22.430" style="s2">socially we&#39;re missing the most these</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.690" end="02:28:24.649" style="s2">days to your point about Bali and but</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.430" end="02:28:26.449" style="s2">you know transformational culture is</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.649" end="02:28:29.029" style="s2">that people that really good at the atom</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.449" end="02:28:31.220" style="s2">bomb peak experiences these days they</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.029" end="02:28:33.260" style="s2">can blow up sky-high their</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.220" end="02:28:36.109" style="s2">they&#39;re terrible at the other 360 days</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.260" end="02:28:37.760" style="s2">of you the simple stuff yeah and right</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.109" end="02:28:39.680" style="s2">sleep right you know like at a daily</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.760" end="02:28:42.170" style="s2">practice and like even like a revival a</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.680" end="02:28:44.359" style="s2">meditate corrective Sabbath elective</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.170" end="02:28:45.949" style="s2">that tone the bell yeah yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.359" end="02:28:48.140" style="s2">actually I noticed it&#39;s such an odd</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.949" end="02:28:53.060" style="s2">thing for me is that I grew up in in</p>
<p begin="02:28:48.140" end="02:28:54.560" style="s2">Texas in the 70s so where prayer at</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.060" end="02:28:57.410" style="s2">mealtimes was actually very commonplace</p>
<p begin="02:28:54.560" end="02:28:58.640" style="s2">but my family didn&#39;t practice that so I</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.410" end="02:29:02.689" style="s2">had this experience of like what the</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.640" end="02:29:04.399" style="s2">heck is that and this was when move into</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.689" end="02:29:06.170" style="s2">secularism and even the New Atheism was</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.399" end="02:29:07.489" style="s2">becoming part of the cultural fabric so</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.170" end="02:29:10.790" style="s2">as would is that and also a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.489" end="02:29:12.859" style="s2">of like that&#39;s not cool alright and as I</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.790" end="02:29:13.910" style="s2">got older that actually kind of</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.859" end="02:29:15.800" style="s2">disappeared but I&#39;ve actually noticed</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.910" end="02:29:17.810" style="s2">over the past what maybe even four years</p>
<p begin="02:29:15.800" end="02:29:20.029" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually been to build a prayer and</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.810" end="02:29:21.859" style="s2">mealtime practice myself but from the</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.029" end="02:29:24.319" style="s2">inside out meaning that it&#39;s not formal</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.859" end="02:29:25.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not imposed I&#39;m not like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.319" end="02:29:28.399" style="s2">reciting a script that I&#39;ve learned I</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.880" end="02:29:31.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t learned it rather I had an</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.399" end="02:29:33.830" style="s2">insight which was oh well there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.279" end="02:29:38.720" style="s2">of basic practices like feeling deep</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.830" end="02:29:41.899" style="s2">gratitude that are crucial and you</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.720" end="02:29:43.520" style="s2">always have to eat yeah so I would</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.899" end="02:29:45.529" style="s2">always forget to have my gratitude</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.520" end="02:29:47.390" style="s2">practice but when I said you know what</p>
<p begin="02:29:45.529" end="02:29:48.739" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do this before I eat I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.390" end="02:29:50.029" style="s2">do my gratitude practice I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.739" end="02:29:52.040" style="s2">bind something that just has this really</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.029" end="02:29:52.729" style="s2">cool characteristic of being really hard</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.040" end="02:29:55.520" style="s2">to forget</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.729" end="02:29:58.279" style="s2">ie eating with something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.520" end="02:30:00.739" style="s2">useful and has a little bit of cultural</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.279" end="02:30:02.449" style="s2">Vectren just combine the two and then it</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.739" end="02:30:05.479" style="s2">just began to expand from there so this</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.449" end="02:30:07.100" style="s2">is of course the recreation of ritual it</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.479" end="02:30:09.620" style="s2">is also part of the story yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.100" end="02:30:11.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of culture hacking we can</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.620" end="02:30:16.069" style="s2">do right I mean I mean grace gratitude</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.720" end="02:30:18.229" style="s2">at dinner Shabbos you know Sabbath day</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.069" end="02:30:19.850" style="s2">down a down day every week to reflect</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.229" end="02:30:23.000" style="s2">and reset like these are simple things</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.850" end="02:30:24.710" style="s2">that are easy to dust off and reanimate</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.000" end="02:30:26.630" style="s2">and I really think again I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.710" end="02:30:27.979" style="s2">a lot that can be open sourced we just</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.630" end="02:30:31.489" style="s2">have to make sure that we&#39;re not open</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.979" end="02:30:33.721" style="s2">sourcing the technology we&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.489" end="02:30:37.440" style="s2">sourcing the technology to</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.721" end="02:30:42.061" style="s2">and bring into insight so don&#39;t open</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.440" end="02:30:44.521" style="s2">source the info open source things that</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.061" end="02:30:47.700" style="s2">build developmental capacity the</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.521" end="02:30:48.960" style="s2">generative process led Tampa so when you</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.700" end="02:30:51.450" style="s2">said you didn&#39;t come back to prayer</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.960" end="02:30:53.940" style="s2">because you were deciding to adopt the</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.450" end="02:30:54.631" style="s2">tradition but you discovered that that</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.940" end="02:30:56.631" style="s2">made sense</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.631" end="02:30:59.011" style="s2">yeah and earlier you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.631" end="02:31:02.820" style="s2">education that is not teaching info but</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.011" end="02:31:04.921" style="s2">that is facilitating Epiphany yeah when</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.820" end="02:31:06.240" style="s2">someone has real epiphany and they</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.921" end="02:31:07.591" style="s2">figure out something that&#39;s useful and</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.240" end="02:31:09.030" style="s2">then they teach other people and the</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.591" end="02:31:10.591" style="s2">other people don&#39;t understand why and</p>
<p begin="02:31:09.030" end="02:31:12.870" style="s2">that happens a few generations the</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.591" end="02:31:15.631" style="s2">Dharma becomes dogma right like the</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.870" end="02:31:16.681" style="s2">thing that that had real wisdom just</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.631" end="02:31:19.110" style="s2">becomes a thing to do because the</p>
<p begin="02:31:16.681" end="02:31:20.460" style="s2">authorities told us and then liberation</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.110" end="02:31:22.740" style="s2">actually looks like rebelling against it</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.460" end="02:31:25.110" style="s2">and even if we&#39;re submitting to it we</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.740" end="02:31:27.061" style="s2">don&#39;t really get the gist and so to not</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.110" end="02:31:30.660" style="s2">have Dharma become dogma and become a</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.061" end="02:31:32.761" style="s2">control system it has to be alive and</p>
<p begin="02:31:30.660" end="02:31:34.561" style="s2">real and rediscovered for everyone and</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.761" end="02:31:36.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a different process than an</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.561" end="02:31:38.610" style="s2">emetic transmission exactly the medic</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.450" end="02:31:41.431" style="s2">transmission well what about a catalytic</p>
<p begin="02:31:38.610" end="02:31:44.311" style="s2">mimetic because that has to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:31:41.431" end="02:31:46.200" style="s2">good syllables doesn&#39;t it sound like no</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.311" end="02:31:48.950" style="s2">truly I mean what would to your point</p>

<p begin="02:31:51.660" end="02:31:57.750" style="s2">disclosure that that could arguably be a</p>

<p begin="02:31:57.750" end="02:32:01.830" style="s2">protocols mmm-hmm yeah yeah no more I</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.910" end="02:32:06.360" style="s2">mean I&#39;m interested like we&#39;re even a</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.830" end="02:32:09.830" style="s2">mythopoetic catalytic mimetic so what is</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.360" end="02:32:12.570" style="s2">the story of how we begin to remember</p>
<p begin="02:32:09.830" end="02:32:15.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to have to be again more</p>
<p begin="02:32:12.570" end="02:32:18.360" style="s2">in the direction of poetry or the</p>
<p begin="02:32:15.030" end="02:32:20.910" style="s2">parable of how we begin to remember so</p>
<p begin="02:32:18.360" end="02:32:23.311" style="s2">that it&#39;s hinting to people in</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.910" end="02:32:26.730" style="s2">themselves moments in their lives but</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.311" end="02:32:28.410" style="s2">they have in fact come across stumbled</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.730" end="02:32:30.631" style="s2">across or opened into beginning to</p>
<p begin="02:32:28.410" end="02:32:32.400" style="s2">remember such that they can find in</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.631" end="02:32:33.540" style="s2">themselves the thread that is there is</p>
<p begin="02:32:32.400" end="02:32:36.271" style="s2">that they can begin to follow with</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.540" end="02:32:40.681" style="s2">greater clarity mmm-hmm yes and then I</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.271" end="02:32:41.851" style="s2">can testify by the fruits right and then</p>
<p begin="02:32:40.681" end="02:32:45.480" style="s2">we have to be very mindful of the fact</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.851" end="02:32:48.150" style="s2">that you this is what the twelfth</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.480" end="02:32:52.410" style="s2">done we&#39;ve kind of gone through this</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.150" end="02:32:56.550" style="s2">cycle on who&#39;s counting which we got the</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.410" end="02:32:58.800" style="s2">axial age we had the Christian Islamic</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.550" end="02:33:00.391" style="s2">era we had you know we have a series of</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.800" end="02:33:02.700" style="s2">points where there&#39;s like okay guys</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.391" end="02:33:04.920" style="s2">here&#39;s a whole new level up you know</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.700" end="02:33:06.570" style="s2">somebody has an epiphany they have a</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.920" end="02:33:08.311" style="s2">real epiphany it&#39;s for real and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.570" end="02:33:11.360" style="s2">like all right this time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.311" end="02:33:13.500" style="s2">turning to Dogma guys let&#39;s get it right</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.360" end="02:33:17.220" style="s2">the trick of course here is that we kind</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.500" end="02:33:18.690" style="s2">of have to okay so this comes to what</p>
<p begin="02:33:17.220" end="02:33:21.840" style="s2">you were saying earlier that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.690" end="02:33:23.820" style="s2">comment on I&#39;m gonna say something that</p>
<p begin="02:33:21.840" end="02:33:26.641" style="s2">will sound like really inspiring or</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.820" end="02:33:31.561" style="s2">depressing or ridiculous I&#39;ll go with</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.641" end="02:33:33.540" style="s2">ridiculous go so I&#39;m gonna speak</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.561" end="02:33:34.860" style="s2">mythopoetic ly about the space that we</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.540" end="02:33:39.300" style="s2">read we&#39;ve talked about it like this</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.860" end="02:33:41.340" style="s2">before is that exponential tech the</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.300" end="02:33:44.851" style="s2">technology extends the power of our</p>
<p begin="02:33:41.340" end="02:33:46.110" style="s2">choice making and but our we have tools</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.851" end="02:33:47.431" style="s2">that give us the ability to make better</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.110" end="02:33:48.630" style="s2">tools that give us the ability to make</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.431" end="02:33:50.400" style="s2">better tools so we have an exponential</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.630" end="02:33:52.110" style="s2">curve it&#39;s just been very slow and now</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.400" end="02:33:55.141" style="s2">it&#39;s not very slow now it&#39;s in the very</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.110" end="02:33:57.720" style="s2">quickly compounding place and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:33:55.141" end="02:33:59.490" style="s2">getting exponentially larger levers on</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.720" end="02:34:02.000" style="s2">our choices but we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.490" end="02:34:04.860" style="s2">exponentially better choice making and</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.000" end="02:34:06.990" style="s2">so we are getting the power of gods</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.860" end="02:34:08.910" style="s2">without getting the love or wisdom of</p>
<p begin="02:34:06.990" end="02:34:12.630" style="s2">gods to wield that power that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:34:08.910" end="02:34:14.700" style="s2">self-determination scenario I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.630" end="02:34:17.311" style="s2">any scenario where we don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.700" end="02:34:20.940" style="s2">power of gods that seems eminent and</p>
<p begin="02:34:17.311" end="02:34:22.771" style="s2">unavoidable and so they&#39;re really like</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.940" end="02:34:26.700" style="s2">there really is this enlightenment or</p>
<p begin="02:34:22.771" end="02:34:29.790" style="s2">bust thing that I see which is if we</p>
<p begin="02:34:26.700" end="02:34:31.681" style="s2">have catastrophic level tech not just</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.790" end="02:34:34.771" style="s2">isolated two state actors but they can</p>
<p begin="02:34:31.681" end="02:34:39.391" style="s2">be radically decentralized who gets to</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.771" end="02:34:40.920" style="s2">be totally up nobody or even not</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.391" end="02:34:43.830" style="s2">be very Omni considerate to can do</p>
<p begin="02:34:40.920" end="02:34:46.740" style="s2">catastrophic stuff on accident so this</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.830" end="02:34:49.230" style="s2">is like the existential Bodhisattva yes</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.740" end="02:34:51.300" style="s2">it is this is the bodhisattva imperative</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.230" end="02:34:53.101" style="s2">actually has to become universal for us</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.300" end="02:34:54.780" style="s2">to make it through this phase and that</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.101" end="02:34:55.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t true in the Bronze Age or Stone</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.780" end="02:34:57.510" style="s2">Age or Iron Age</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.680" end="02:34:59.130" style="s2">the other ages because we could just</p>
<p begin="02:34:57.510" end="02:35:01.140" style="s2">kill a lot of people we could destroy a</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.130" end="02:35:02.580" style="s2">lot of environments and we did now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.140" end="02:35:03.810" style="s2">just kill everybody in all environment</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.580" end="02:35:05.100" style="s2">right so let&#39;s then jump back to the</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.810" end="02:35:07.560" style="s2">story I was trying to tell earlier quite</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.100" end="02:35:10.199" style="s2">poorly so zone of proximal development</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.560" end="02:35:13.109" style="s2">we&#39;ve all got that notion right that</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.199" end="02:35:14.939" style="s2">there&#39;s a place we could get to now</p>
<p begin="02:35:13.109" end="02:35:18.380" style="s2">let&#39;s think about them the level up from</p>
<p begin="02:35:14.939" end="02:35:21.689" style="s2">Homo habilis to homo sapiens and the</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.380" end="02:35:24.420" style="s2">many many different things that all had</p>
<p begin="02:35:21.689" end="02:35:25.939" style="s2">to come together simultaneously for that</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.420" end="02:35:29.010" style="s2">zone of proximal development tool and</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.939" end="02:35:31.080" style="s2">you had to have yet Yatta knee and</p>
<p begin="02:35:29.010" end="02:35:32.430" style="s2">grandmothers and fathers and the</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.080" end="02:35:35.040" style="s2">emergence of the capacity for language</p>
<p begin="02:35:32.430" end="02:35:36.270" style="s2">and a certain affinity to not beat the</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.040" end="02:35:37.500" style="s2"> out of other males as soon as you</p>
<p begin="02:35:36.270" end="02:35:40.859" style="s2">can counter like a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="02:35:37.500" end="02:35:43.020" style="s2">each one of which independently isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:35:40.859" end="02:35:44.580" style="s2">necessary particularly useful and any</p>
<p begin="02:35:43.020" end="02:35:46.229" style="s2">one of which is lacking it the thing</p>
<p begin="02:35:44.580" end="02:35:48.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold together very well right so</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.229" end="02:35:49.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a bunch of like little micro</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.090" end="02:35:50.910" style="s2">versions and if they don&#39;t that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:35:49.470" end="02:35:52.199" style="s2">work and they fall apart until</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.910" end="02:35:54.540" style="s2">eventually get to the zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.199" end="02:35:56.640" style="s2">development and then pop it kind of pops</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.540" end="02:35:58.979" style="s2">together I was thinking about that in</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.640" end="02:36:01.199" style="s2">terms of oK we&#39;ve we&#39;re in this place</p>
<p begin="02:35:58.979" end="02:36:03.270" style="s2">for all right we&#39;re making another run</p>
<p begin="02:36:01.199" end="02:36:04.890" style="s2">at it we&#39;re trying to get we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.270" end="02:36:07.890" style="s2">to get to this spot and the question is</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.890" end="02:36:09.540" style="s2">well was what are the pieces what are</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.890" end="02:36:10.830" style="s2">the pieces of the puzzle and I was</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.540" end="02:36:12.300" style="s2">really interested in like noticing that</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.830" end="02:36:13.979" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a whole bunch and they come</p>
<p begin="02:36:12.300" end="02:36:16.229" style="s2">from lots of different places you know</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.979" end="02:36:19.080" style="s2">you mentioned the Quakers and the Sioux</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.229" end="02:36:20.220" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about like Buddhism has</p>
<p begin="02:36:19.080" end="02:36:22.380" style="s2">stuff like non-attachment</p>
<p begin="02:36:20.220" end="02:36:23.699" style="s2">like one of the interesting traps for</p>
<p begin="02:36:22.380" end="02:36:25.620" style="s2">example I was thinking through in terms</p>
<p begin="02:36:23.699" end="02:36:28.550" style="s2">of like okay if I had an epiphany and I</p>
<p begin="02:36:25.620" end="02:36:30.449" style="s2">want to share it and it turns to Dogma</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.550" end="02:36:33.720" style="s2">one of the reasons when in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.449" end="02:36:36.810" style="s2">Dogma is attachment I want people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.720" end="02:36:38.640" style="s2">attached to the good word and so some</p>
<p begin="02:36:36.810" end="02:36:40.560" style="s2">interesting things about okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:36:38.640" end="02:36:45.300" style="s2">toolkit what are the pieces of this next</p>
<p begin="02:36:40.560" end="02:36:48.750" style="s2">stage that if they come together they</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.300" end="02:36:50.370" style="s2">mutually support each other like the mat</p>
<p begin="02:36:48.750" end="02:36:51.660" style="s2">that when people stand in a circle they</p>
<p begin="02:36:50.370" end="02:36:52.800" style="s2">all kind of like turn and they begin to</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.660" end="02:36:54.870" style="s2">sit down simultaneously</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.800" end="02:36:56.160" style="s2">we&#39;re just perfectly as you begin to</p>
<p begin="02:36:54.870" end="02:36:57.210" style="s2">lose your balance you sit and you land</p>
<p begin="02:36:56.160" end="02:36:58.560" style="s2">on somebody else&#39;s knees and it goes all</p>
<p begin="02:36:57.210" end="02:37:00.840" style="s2">the way around the whole circle like</p>
<p begin="02:36:58.560" end="02:37:02.580" style="s2">what&#39;s that thing where all the pieces</p>
<p begin="02:37:00.840" end="02:37:03.840" style="s2">come together and the stage now has the</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.580" end="02:37:07.850" style="s2">elements that support each other so we</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.840" end="02:37:07.850" style="s2">actually have reached a new place</p>
<p begin="02:37:08.420" end="02:37:13.020" style="s2">and what I notice is this this really</p>
<p begin="02:37:10.680" end="02:37:14.130" style="s2">interesting thing where like if I</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.020" end="02:37:15.990" style="s2">applied non-attachment</p>
<p begin="02:37:14.130" end="02:37:17.670" style="s2">and humility by the way which are really</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.990" end="02:37:18.720" style="s2">interesting cross products if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.670" end="02:37:20.250" style="s2">coming from very different Latin</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.720" end="02:37:21.300" style="s2">lineages and they reinforce each other</p>
<p begin="02:37:20.250" end="02:37:25.080" style="s2">quite nice so say them again</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.300" end="02:37:29.550" style="s2">non-attachment and humility in the</p>
<p begin="02:37:25.080" end="02:37:31.860" style="s2">context of urgency and in the context by</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.550" end="02:37:34.950" style="s2">the way of we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:37:31.860" end="02:37:36.390" style="s2">conversations about the if you really</p>
<p begin="02:37:34.950" end="02:37:38.000" style="s2">really think clearly about the</p>
<p begin="02:37:36.390" end="02:37:40.200" style="s2">circumstances that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.000" end="02:37:42.720" style="s2">even just the simple construction daniel</p>
<p begin="02:37:40.200" end="02:37:45.210" style="s2">did of as you&#39;re becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="02:37:42.720" end="02:37:46.439" style="s2">powerful as you become unlike and to god</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.210" end="02:37:49.439" style="s2">in the direction of destructive capacity</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.439" end="02:37:50.970" style="s2">if there&#39;s not an equivalent like unto</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.439" end="02:37:52.890" style="s2">god then in level of wisdom and care</p>
