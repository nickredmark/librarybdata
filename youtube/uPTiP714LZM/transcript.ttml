<p begin="00:04:47.640" end="00:04:52.920" style="s2">right we are going to be talking today</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.980" end="00:04:56.190" style="s2">as we have been about the developing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.920" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">situation with the Cova da by rescind</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.190" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">the global lockdown that we are all</p>

<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">some business and then some Corrections</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">the business I think involves alerting</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:14.280" style="s2">people to the fact that we are as we did</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">a couple of weeks ago we are still</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.280" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">experimenting with different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:22.950" style="s2">make this all function but we are going</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">to do something on the order of a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.950" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">hour to 45 minutes of live discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:31.410" style="s2">you can file super super chat questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">during that time and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:36.210" style="s2">address those questions in a separate</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">livestream which will be linked in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.210" end="00:05:42.690" style="s2">description to this live stream after a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:44.220" style="s2">few minute break hopefully this will all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.690" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">work out hopefully you won&#39;t face any</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">lag on your end we are still working out</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:53.790" style="s2">the technology behind having the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:55.650" style="s2">here and so if there are any technical</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.790" end="00:05:56.390" style="s2">glitches please bear with us we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.650" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">what we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:06:00.570" style="s2">so just to be just to be clear just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">in our third live stream we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.570" end="00:06:05.370" style="s2">have a conversation with each other here</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:08.669" style="s2">for half an hour to an hour 45 minutes</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.050" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">the scenes and then we&#39;ll take a break</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.900" end="00:06:21.479" style="s2">brief break and then come back with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:24.419" style="s2">second live stream immediately</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.479" end="00:06:26.280" style="s2">afterwards and address hopefully all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.419" end="00:06:28.470" style="s2">the super chat questions that you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.280" end="00:06:31.620" style="s2">asked during this and during the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:33.330" style="s2">Q&amp;A live stream great all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.620" end="00:06:36.280" style="s2">start with two Corrections I have two</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.330" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">Corrections this week and then I have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.280" end="00:06:40.150" style="s2">note about something we just discussed</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:43.090" style="s2">at the end of last week the two</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.150" end="00:06:45.340" style="s2">Corrections are as follows one I said</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.090" end="00:06:48.130" style="s2">that I thought it made sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.340" end="00:06:50.250" style="s2">Pope to issue a decree which I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.130" end="00:06:55.960" style="s2">would be called an encyclical that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:58.510" style="s2">declared cremation to be a viable form</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.960" end="00:07:00.760" style="s2">of body disposal for Catholics and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.510" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">Pope has done this but apparently he did</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.760" end="00:07:05.710" style="s2">so in the 50s so I&#39;m a little bit behind</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:08.290" style="s2">the curve on that now it doesn&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.710" end="00:07:11.140" style="s2">the point very much I still think it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.290" end="00:07:12.910" style="s2">would be wise for the Pope to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.140" end="00:07:16.300" style="s2">something clearer about the desirability</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.910" end="00:07:19.860" style="s2">of dealing with bodies fast enough such</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.300" end="00:07:25.720" style="s2">that even if people in Latin America are</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.860" end="00:07:28.919" style="s2">desiring of a more traditional burial</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">that the priority here probably involves</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.919" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">bending those expectations a bit and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:37.150" style="s2">getting the system back to functioning</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">which could mean larger scale cremation</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.150" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">or it could mean temporary burial of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:47.800" style="s2">bodies in a way that they could be</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:50.290" style="s2">exhumed and reburied later which one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.800" end="00:07:51.580" style="s2">the Ecuador and officials did release a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.290" end="00:07:53.080" style="s2">statement saying that it was very</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.580" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">important that these berries these</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.080" end="00:07:58.990" style="s2">bodies be buried individually with</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:00.820" style="s2">proper ceremony so anyway these two</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.990" end="00:08:03.250" style="s2">things are in tension even if I had the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.820" end="00:08:06.340" style="s2">the cremation point wrong the second</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.250" end="00:08:08.410" style="s2">issue involves the the Theodore</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.340" end="00:08:10.870" style="s2">Roosevelt the aircraft carrier which</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.410" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">docked in Guam and the commanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.870" end="00:08:19.090" style="s2">officer was I believe suspended by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.130" end="00:08:21.310" style="s2">Navy and I had declared him an admiral</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.090" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">which involves two errors he apparently</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.310" end="00:08:24.220" style="s2">was not an admiral he was the captain of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:26.979" style="s2">the Theodore Roosevelt but not an</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.220" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">admiral so that&#39;s one errand the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.979" end="00:08:31.990" style="s2">areas I apparently don&#39;t have the power</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:34.990" style="s2">to promote him so yeah you&#39;re bad yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.990" end="00:08:37.659" style="s2">maybe that can be addressed before the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.990" end="00:08:40.300" style="s2">next podcast but all right the third if</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.659" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">you want to promote a now-cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.300" end="00:08:46.390" style="s2">oh no I want the power to promote I see</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">him to the rank of Admiral I support</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.390" end="00:08:50.230" style="s2">this okay good all right third thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">involves</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.230" end="00:08:56.230" style="s2">a weird bit of happenstance as we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">doing our last livestream Joe Rogan had</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.230" end="00:09:01.000" style="s2">my brother on which I did not know was</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:05.650" style="s2">coming and they had a discussion which</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.000" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2">caused a lot of interest in which Eric</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.650" end="00:09:09.480" style="s2">said something very much like what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.030" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">said about if the Democrats were to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:15.700" style="s2">nominate Biden that we would be unable</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:17.830" style="s2">to vote for Trump but wouldn&#39;t vote for</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:19.630" style="s2">Biden and Joe Rogan said something truly</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.830" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">provocative which is that he in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.630" end="00:09:25.540" style="s2">that event would vote for Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:27.310" style="s2">which which is which is a match for what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.540" end="00:09:31.470" style="s2">you said and what you&#39;ve said to me for</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.310" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">weeks now which is that the DNC</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.470" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">promoting Biden and having Biden be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.530" style="s2">other candidate is perhaps the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:40.630" style="s2">argument that you could see for voting</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.530" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">for Trump yeah I want I won&#39;t do it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.630" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">but you could but you could see it being</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:48.070" style="s2">the only argument that said what I what</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:49.690" style="s2">I said last livestream was that in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.070" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">event that the Democrats make the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.690" end="00:09:54.070" style="s2">incredibly foolish choice to nominate</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:55.750" style="s2">Biden and I realized nomination is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.070" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2">supposed to be a result of the way the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.750" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">party votes but that in effect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:02.980" style="s2">been a very coordinated effort to rally</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:05.860" style="s2">around Biden and to shame Sanders for</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.980" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">example in - it&#39;s supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.860" end="00:10:09.610" style="s2">populist votes but it appeared to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">top-down from the party at some level</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.610" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">top-down from the party and of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:15.910" style="s2">the party is structured to game its own</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:17.700" style="s2">convention and there&#39;s a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.910" end="00:10:21.220" style="s2">behind-the-scenes stuff but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.700" end="00:10:22.960" style="s2">what I said was that in the event they</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">nominated Biden that it would justify</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.960" end="00:10:26.500" style="s2">what I called mutiny and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:27.100" style="s2">deliberately vague about exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.500" end="00:10:33.100" style="s2">that meant</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.100" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">however in in if we put that up next to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.100" end="00:10:35.890" style="s2">Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:38.200" style="s2">statement that he&#39;s going to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.890" end="00:10:41.730" style="s2">Trump in that case I would say voting</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.200" end="00:10:44.080" style="s2">for Trump would be a pointless waste of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.730" end="00:10:47.500" style="s2">the opportunity that we will have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.080" end="00:10:49.270" style="s2">forced into and anyway Joe I&#39;d love to</p>

<p begin="00:10:55.329" end="00:10:59.619" style="s2">put together so they&#39;ll come later if if</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.910" end="00:11:01.149" style="s2">I am if they are brought to my attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.619" end="00:11:04.329" style="s2">all right great</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.149" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">so where should we start well we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.329" end="00:11:11.980" style="s2">to I think spend time today talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:15.189" style="s2">about whether or not Cove at night teen</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.980" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">is being treated the right way and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.189" end="00:11:21.610" style="s2">understood the correct way with regard</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:23.459" style="s2">to its mechanisms of action right yes so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.610" end="00:11:26.559" style="s2">you know it&#39;s some level the question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.459" end="00:11:30.699" style="s2">if this is a this is a respiratory virus</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.559" end="00:11:33.869" style="s2">and it appears to be it it has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.699" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">widely reported as producing pneumonia</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.869" end="00:11:41.199" style="s2">which causes people to be unable to pull</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:44.319" style="s2">enough oxygen into their lungs and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.199" end="00:11:47.829" style="s2">respirators and then ventilators are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.319" end="00:11:50.920" style="s2">go to go to treatment and once people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.829" end="00:11:53.350" style="s2">are put on ventilators the rate of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.920" end="00:11:55.929" style="s2">fatality rate is incredibly high higher</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.350" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">than it is under normal cases of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.929" end="00:11:59.619" style="s2">with pneumonia having to be put on</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">ventilators which just just that single</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.619" end="00:12:02.740" style="s2">observation right there begs this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:05.860" style="s2">question of what what is so different</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.740" end="00:12:07.899" style="s2">about pneumonia caused by SARS co2 than</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.860" end="00:12:11.139" style="s2">other pneumonia pneumonia being a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.899" end="00:12:15.309" style="s2">broad description of a sort of a class</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.309" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">caused by any number of things and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.079" end="00:12:19.869" style="s2">would just you know caveat again as</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:22.449" style="s2">we&#39;ve done in at least a few of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.869" end="00:12:24.009" style="s2">other ones we are both we both have PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.449" end="00:12:25.269" style="s2">and evolutionary biology but we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.699" end="00:12:30.850" style="s2">bit outside of our wheelhouse with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.139" end="00:12:33.069" style="s2">regard to the molecular mechanism here</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.850" end="00:12:36.249" style="s2">but the question the question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.069" end="00:12:40.269" style="s2">being raised is what you know at one</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.249" end="00:12:41.860" style="s2">level why our ventilators proving the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.269" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">thing that is necessary for so many</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.860" end="00:12:45.459" style="s2">people here and yet so much less</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:47.649" style="s2">effective than it is in other cases of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.459" end="00:12:50.529" style="s2">pneumonia therefore is it in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.649" end="00:12:54.669" style="s2">pneumonia and is it acute respiratory</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.120" style="s2">see you in which he says I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this right so I should say</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.120" end="00:13:26.910" style="s2">this was a topic of discussion for us</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:30.430" style="s2">for several days now I not yet this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.910" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">video came to our attention which</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.430" end="00:13:34.780" style="s2">reflected a theme that we were beginning</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.740" end="00:13:37.630" style="s2">to wonder about for other reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.780" end="00:13:39.340" style="s2">that&#39;s doubly confirming that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.630" end="00:13:40.630" style="s2">might be something down this road if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.340" end="00:13:42.550" style="s2">were beginning to think something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.630" end="00:13:44.230" style="s2">the story isn&#39;t right and then we find</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.550" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">another source especially somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.230" end="00:13:48.400" style="s2">on the front lines of treating these</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:50.230" style="s2">patients that that reinforces the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.400" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s something to it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.230" end="00:13:53.650" style="s2">talk about some of how you you first</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:55.090" style="s2">came to be thinking the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.650" end="00:13:56.980" style="s2">want to say is that I think we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.090" end="00:13:59.890" style="s2">to get tangled in this question of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.980" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">pneumonia and we shouldn&#39;t get tangled</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.890" end="00:14:04.780" style="s2">in the question of the monkey the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">is pneumonia is what we might call a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.780" end="00:14:09.310" style="s2">syndrome it is not the result of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.810" end="00:14:11.650" style="s2">particular pathogen or even a type of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.310" end="00:14:13.990" style="s2">pathogen it&#39;s basically defined as</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.650" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">inflammation within the lungs that</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.990" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">interferes with gas exchange and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">can be caused by bacteria can be caused</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:23.110" style="s2">by viruses it can be caused by any one</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:26.080" style="s2">of a number of things but it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.110" end="00:14:28.330" style="s2">more or less as fluid in the lungs which</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.080" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">is more opaque on a scan than the lungs</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.330" end="00:14:37.810" style="s2">should be so a little a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">HIV causes age age HIV causes AIDS but</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.810" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">people generally die of some secondary</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:46.900" style="s2">infection right so SARS Cove 2 causes</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:48.340" style="s2">Cove at 19 but people often are dying of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.900" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">some kind of respiratory distress which</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.340" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">has been often classified as pneumonia</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:55.780" style="s2">right now I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m not very</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">interested in whether it is or isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.780" end="00:15:02.980" style="s2">pneumonia I think the point is there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:05.800" style="s2">severe respiratory symptoms what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.980" end="00:15:09.250" style="s2">important to figure out is in light of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.800" end="00:15:12.400" style="s2">all we don&#39;t know about Kovac 19 the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.250" end="00:15:13.570" style="s2">fact that there seemed to be I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.400" end="00:15:16.150" style="s2">it described as - but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.570" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">really three trajectories there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.150" end="00:15:21.730" style="s2">asymptomatic version</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:23.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a relatively mild symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.730" end="00:15:26.860" style="s2">version and then there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.529" end="00:15:29.860" style="s2">catastrophic decline and if you end up</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.860" end="00:15:32.740" style="s2">in that third category what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.860" end="00:15:35.230" style="s2">you is pretty dire but one question is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.740" end="00:15:38.350" style="s2">is it that at the point that you kick</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.230" end="00:15:41.320" style="s2">over into this third category that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.350" end="00:15:43.269" style="s2">you&#39;re already in such serious shape</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:47.320" style="s2">than a risk that a respirator or</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.269" end="00:15:48.970" style="s2">ventilator can&#39;t help you or is that not</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.320" end="00:15:50.380" style="s2">the right treatment because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.970" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">misunderstood what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.380" end="00:15:54.790" style="s2">characterizes that phase might in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:57.639" style="s2">be counterproductive right of treatment</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.790" end="00:15:59.829" style="s2">right like might as can we just show</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.639" end="00:16:03.190" style="s2">this not the video but if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.829" end="00:16:05.290" style="s2">just put on the screen the thumbnail</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.190" end="00:16:09.010" style="s2">from this video sack so people can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.290" end="00:16:10.750" style="s2">again it&#39;s dr. Cameron Kyle&#39;s Adele his</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.010" end="00:16:14.290" style="s2">argument is that what he&#39;s seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.750" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">eye and his ICU is not people who look</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.290" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">like they have pneumonia with all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:20.920" style="s2">caveats we just made but it&#39;s it looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:24.519" style="s2">to him like people are on a plane at</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.920" end="00:16:26.380" style="s2">30,000 feet and the pressurization on</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.519" end="00:16:29.050" style="s2">the plane is gradually going away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.380" end="00:16:33.820" style="s2">like people are having acute altitude</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.050" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">sickness that they are unable to - they</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.820" end="00:16:39.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have the oxygen that they need as</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">opposed to they cannot they cannot bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.640" end="00:16:45.820" style="s2">up the muscular strength the lung muscle</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:48.699" style="s2">or the neurological ability to to do the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.820" end="00:16:50.050" style="s2">respiratory actions that they need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.699" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">use the oxygen in their body it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.050" end="00:16:55.209" style="s2">they just don&#39;t have the oxygen actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:58.149" style="s2">available and probably it seems this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.209" end="00:16:59.620" style="s2">because the virus itself is grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.149" end="00:17:03.370" style="s2">oxygen but that&#39;s what it&#39;s hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.620" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">well so as a virus it has no need for</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.370" end="00:17:08.770" style="s2">oxygen so it&#39;s not grabbing it for its</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">own purpose hungry exactly yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.770" end="00:17:13.030" style="s2">the picture that is emerging and again I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this picture will turn out</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.030" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">to be false as well but the picture that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.400" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">seems to be emerging is that the virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:24.339" style="s2">as a matter of course is interacting</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">with hemoglobin molecules now for those</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.339" end="00:17:29.429" style="s2">of you who have not studied this</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">hemoglobin is an absolutely stunning</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.279" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">very active and therefore requires a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">of oxygen to do the metabolic work of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:53.820" style="s2">motion but the thing that&#39;s so stunning</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:55.960" style="s2">about hemoglobin is that it has this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.820" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">capacity to have an extremely high</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.960" end="00:18:04.600" style="s2">affinity for oxygen in your in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:07.210" style="s2">environment and then it picks up co2</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.600" end="00:18:09.610" style="s2">with a very high affinity and drops it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.210" end="00:18:12.940" style="s2">off so it&#39;s picking up hema it&#39;s picking</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.610" end="00:18:14.440" style="s2">up co2 in the tissues of the body where</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.940" end="00:18:16.090" style="s2">metabolic work has been done and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.440" end="00:18:18.220" style="s2">dropping it off in the lungs where it</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.090" end="00:18:20.590" style="s2">then picks up a lot of oxygen and moves</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.220" end="00:18:22.779" style="s2">it into the body and so it is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.590" end="00:18:25.149" style="s2">molecular mechanism of gas exchange it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.779" end="00:18:28.059" style="s2">is yeah it is the molecular core of gas</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.149" end="00:18:31.330" style="s2">exchange and the thing is to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.059" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">that that molecule is failing it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.330" end="00:18:39.370" style="s2">predicts a whole slew of other failures</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">downstream including the heart obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.370" end="00:18:42.610" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got this very hard working</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.100" style="s2">muscle that even when the rest of you as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.610" end="00:18:47.080" style="s2">it rest is still pumping away and to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.100" end="00:18:49.929" style="s2">extent that the hemoglobin itself is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.080" end="00:18:51.549" style="s2">under attack that predicts that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.929" end="00:18:53.669" style="s2">heart the lungs and everything else in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.549" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">the body is going to be facing this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.669" end="00:18:57.100" style="s2">extremely difficult problem to solve</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:19:00.159" style="s2">which is how do you do the work of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.100" end="00:19:01.899" style="s2">repair and fighting when work is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.159" end="00:19:03.580" style="s2">slowed down it&#39;s like a supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.899" end="00:19:08.519" style="s2">problem inside the body</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.580" end="00:19:11.610" style="s2">mm-hmm so there&#39;s a question about why</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.519" end="00:19:14.740" style="s2">kovat 19 seems to be interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.610" end="00:19:16.690" style="s2">hemoglobin but what does is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.740" end="00:19:19.149" style="s2">increasingly clear and I must say the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.690" end="00:19:22.450" style="s2">one thing I&#39;m learning is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.149" end="00:19:24.580" style="s2">when normal academic publishing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.450" end="00:19:27.490" style="s2">no time for it and so there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.580" end="00:19:28.990" style="s2">literature evolving that actually has</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.490" end="00:19:30.639" style="s2">done something very interesting which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.990" end="00:19:32.169" style="s2">it is bypassed peer review because</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.639" end="00:19:34.149" style="s2">there&#39;s simply no time and it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.169" end="00:19:36.639" style="s2">happening on these preprint servers</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.149" end="00:19:40.090" style="s2">where papers can be published by anybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.639" end="00:19:41.139" style="s2">within a particular field and you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.090" end="00:19:42.789" style="s2">read them right away</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.379" end="00:19:48.879" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a much healthier</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:57.550" style="s2">surely people know but the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.810" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">that suggest that there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.550" end="00:24:01.390" style="s2">value of injecting is it just plasma</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:03.100" style="s2">that they&#39;ve injected from people who&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.100" end="00:24:07.150" style="s2">or I believe it was blood transfusions</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.870" end="00:24:08.470" style="s2">was it not both have been both have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.150" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">proposed and I don&#39;t know if both have</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.470" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">been enacted</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:15.010" style="s2">so this raises the question if it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:16.630" style="s2">blood transfusions that have shown</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.010" end="00:24:17.919" style="s2">promise in treating people blood</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.630" end="00:24:19.780" style="s2">transfusions from people who have</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.919" end="00:24:21.669" style="s2">recovered it is possible that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.780" end="00:24:23.409" style="s2">misinterpret the reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.669" end="00:24:25.990" style="s2">function it may be that they&#39;re rescuing</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.409" end="00:24:27.640" style="s2">people based on just the simple fact of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:30.850" style="s2">functional hemoglobin that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.640" end="00:24:33.070" style="s2">attacked by the virus yet so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.850" end="00:24:35.049" style="s2">these are you you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.070" end="00:24:36.669" style="s2">experiment on sick patients but how</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.049" end="00:24:39.429" style="s2">would we know right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.669" end="00:24:43.090" style="s2">experiment would be that you give sick</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.429" end="00:24:44.650" style="s2">patients intact blood some of which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.090" end="00:24:45.970" style="s2">from people who have recovered from</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.650" end="00:24:47.470" style="s2">kovat 19 and some of which is from</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.970" end="00:24:49.570" style="s2">people who have never been exposed to Co</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.470" end="00:24:51.250" style="s2">at 19 and the prediction here of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.570" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">hypothesis that it&#39;s not the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.250" end="00:24:55.419" style="s2">but the hemoglobin is that people have</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:57.820" style="s2">no difference in recovery between those</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.419" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">two situations but you know under these</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.820" end="00:25:01.299" style="s2">circumstances you don&#39;t want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:03.460" style="s2">that we should be experimenting on</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.299" end="00:25:06.309" style="s2">patients and yet that is exactly that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.460" end="00:25:08.020" style="s2">the only way to know but I guess unless</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.309" end="00:25:11.650" style="s2">we can use animal models we now know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.020" end="00:25:13.690" style="s2">that for instance cats can get it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.650" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know how good a model right other</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.690" end="00:25:18.340" style="s2">creatures are but I would say this has</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">raised another question which is and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.340" end="00:25:26.830" style="s2">can see this in the debate about about</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:28.330" style="s2">chloroquine is there&#39;s a question and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.830" end="00:25:30.280" style="s2">you know this is a famous and old</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.330" end="00:25:32.260" style="s2">question and there is a relaxed set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.280" end="00:25:35.049" style="s2">standards for people who face dire</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.260" end="00:25:37.000" style="s2">circumstances and you know drugs that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.049" end="00:25:40.179" style="s2">aren&#39;t known to be safe can be utilized</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.000" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">in some cases because the person has</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.179" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">very little to lose so in this case we</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">now have a number of things unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">together that force us to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:54.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t usually ask like what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:56.710" style="s2">when a crisis is facing the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:25:58.840" style="s2">your normal mechanism for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.710" end="00:26:00.280" style="s2">that where you might have too much of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.840" end="00:26:01.630" style="s2">some equipment one place but you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.280" end="00:26:02.890" style="s2">always move it somewhere else you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.630" end="00:26:04.780" style="s2">the way we do with firefighting</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.890" end="00:26:07.390" style="s2">equipment when you know part of the West</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.780" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">catches on fire and crews move in from</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.390" end="00:26:11.020" style="s2">somewhere else you can&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:11.860" style="s2">everywhere is on fire and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.020" end="00:26:16.419" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.860" end="00:26:17.470" style="s2">with this virus I know our governor okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.419" end="00:26:20.289" style="s2">the state of Oregon</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.470" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">and the state of Oregon just arranged to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.289" end="00:26:25.010" style="s2">send</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:28.130" style="s2">a hundred and forty ventilators to New</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.010" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">York I&#39;m told that in exchange we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.130" end="00:26:31.549" style="s2">gonna get the Brooklyn Bridge which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.260" style="s2">think is gonna look great</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.549" end="00:26:34.700" style="s2">across the Willamette River I was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.260" end="00:26:38.630" style="s2">for the Statue of Liberty but really</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.700" end="00:26:39.890" style="s2">yeah okay well either way I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.630" end="00:26:41.779" style="s2">sort of hoping for the bridge it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.890" end="00:26:44.840" style="s2">pretty one but either way I&#39;ve have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.779" end="00:26:46.549" style="s2">lot of images yeah that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.840" end="00:26:48.830" style="s2">anyway we&#39;ve got these new these new</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.549" end="00:26:50.390" style="s2">questions about what you do when a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.830" end="00:26:54.490" style="s2">system is stressed in every place at</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.390" end="00:26:58.460" style="s2">once how you navigate a live-fire</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.490" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">exercise with respect to a health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.460" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">at the same time that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:05.169" style="s2">study this that&#39;s that was that issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.370" style="s2">was raised by the question of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.169" end="00:27:10.279" style="s2">docking of the Theodore Roosevelt and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.370" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">what I argued should have happened with</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.279" end="00:27:15.620" style="s2">this unique isolated group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">apparently had been transmitting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.620" end="00:27:19.100" style="s2">infection and how much we could have</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">learned and how much opportunity cost</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.100" end="00:27:23.809" style="s2">there was for just docking it and not</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">just with I mean just to remind people</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.809" end="00:27:27.830" style="s2">in the last livestream I believe what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:29.809" style="s2">you said was we at least just needed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.830" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">take the data the data that weren&#39;t easy</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.809" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">to take and it would have been great if</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.460" end="00:27:35.750" style="s2">we could have asked for them also to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:38.500" style="s2">report out on who they&#39;d interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.750" end="00:27:41.210" style="s2">over some number of days but even just</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.500" end="00:27:43.549" style="s2">collecting data on who was sick and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.210" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">maybe what rooms they shared yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.549" end="00:27:49.480" style="s2">and I I did more thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:52.309" style="s2">afterwards and I realized you know these</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:53.899" style="s2">nuclear-powered ships especially an</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.309" end="00:27:56.990" style="s2">aircraft carrier offers an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.899" end="00:27:59.779" style="s2">other possibility which is if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.990" end="00:28:03.649" style="s2">who was in the chain of command that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.779" end="00:28:07.220" style="s2">forbid the captain from from docking his</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.649" end="00:28:09.500" style="s2">ship was thinking about the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2">of understanding I doubt it was on their</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.500" end="00:28:12.679" style="s2">minds but if it was on their minds that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.940" end="00:28:16.130" style="s2">this was actually a population worth</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.679" end="00:28:18.049" style="s2">knowing something about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.130" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">the ship didn&#39;t have the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.049" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">properly handle these cases and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">everybody was in tight quarters would</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">have allowed you know the thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:28.100" style="s2">very least has an airport on its surface</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:30.530" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s a floating</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.100" end="00:28:32.360" style="s2">airport that&#39;s nuclear-powered we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.530" end="00:28:33.830" style="s2">have docked it somewhere and we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.360" end="00:28:34.260" style="s2">have brought in resources you could have</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.830" end="00:28:36.690" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.260" end="00:28:38.160" style="s2">Hospital on those decks separate people</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.690" end="00:28:40.500" style="s2">treat them properly you could bring in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.160" end="00:28:42.300" style="s2">whatever medical resources were</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">necessary it could have been done well</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.300" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:51.650" style="s2">information we would have gotten from</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:54.150" style="s2">this population whose limits we knew but</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.650" end="00:28:56.160" style="s2">the opportunity that was lost when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.150" end="00:29:00.350" style="s2">just bypassed that over the human</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.160" end="00:29:03.660" style="s2">concerns alone was large yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.350" end="00:29:07.410" style="s2">one other thing I wanted to add with</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.660" end="00:29:11.540" style="s2">regard to the question of SARS Cove to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.410" end="00:29:14.670" style="s2">attacking basically getting at</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.540" end="00:29:16.980" style="s2">hemoglobin and get getting rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.670" end="00:29:19.470" style="s2">iron and making it more difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.980" end="00:29:22.140" style="s2">gas exchange to happen within humans and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.470" end="00:29:25.320" style="s2">some other mammals too is a prediction</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.140" end="00:29:27.720" style="s2">that if this if this is true that those</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.320" end="00:29:30.090" style="s2">populations of humans who are adapted</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.720" end="00:29:32.310" style="s2">either genetically or otherwise but even</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.090" end="00:29:35.460" style="s2">more so genetically to living at high</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.310" end="00:29:37.530" style="s2">altitude will potentially be less</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.460" end="00:29:40.050" style="s2">susceptible to developing extreme</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.530" end="00:29:41.280" style="s2">symptoms of kovat night team I would not</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.050" end="00:29:45.000" style="s2">predict that they would be less</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.280" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">susceptible to to being infected with</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.000" end="00:29:50.160" style="s2">SARS Cove 2 but that once infected that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:52.020" style="s2">they would be less likely to to show</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.160" end="00:29:53.820" style="s2">extreme symptoms and so we you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.020" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a in in the homologous in</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.290" end="00:30:34.800" style="s2">without it which suggests that absent a</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.800" end="00:30:40.020" style="s2">populations and populations at lower a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.870" end="00:30:41.790" style="s2">lot of lower altitudes rather that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.020" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">would expect this to spread absent</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.790" end="00:30:45.810" style="s2">whatever cost there is right there you</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:53.490" style="s2">case must have some cost else presumably</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:55.020" style="s2">it would have spread through the limited</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.490" end="00:30:56.790" style="s2">gene flow that does exist between the</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.790" end="00:31:01.350" style="s2">the world and we&#39;d all have it so there</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:03.690" style="s2">must be some cost which is unspecified</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.350" end="00:31:06.690" style="s2">but right now it&#39;s probably mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.690" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">benefit again the prediction being that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.690" end="00:31:11.340" style="s2">this would be beneficial in the fight</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:13.830" style="s2">against being highly symptomatic with</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.340" end="00:31:15.930" style="s2">covered 19 so there are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.830" end="00:31:18.510" style="s2">things actually that&#39;s that fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.930" end="00:31:21.480" style="s2">rubric a we can infer that you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.510" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">there must be a cost to this extra</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.480" end="00:31:27.390" style="s2">capacity to deal with low oxygen because</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:29.220" style="s2">we also know that when people who live</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.390" end="00:31:31.710" style="s2">at low altitude go to high altitude over</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.220" end="00:31:33.330" style="s2">time they accumulate the capacity so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.710" end="00:31:36.180" style="s2">must be an efficiency concern that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.330" end="00:31:37.590" style="s2">causes it&#39;s an acclamation process</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.180" end="00:31:41.210" style="s2">rather than a genetic change of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.590" end="00:31:44.370" style="s2">whereas individuals within a lifetime so</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.210" end="00:31:47.820" style="s2">that validates the the point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.370" end="00:31:50.730" style="s2">making it is also likely that this plays</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.820" end="00:31:52.500" style="s2">into the fact of this having originally</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.730" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">apparently come from a bat whether it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.500" end="00:31:59.630" style="s2">came directly from a bat or it came</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:32:02.310" style="s2">through another species like pangolins</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.630" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">the thing about bats one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.310" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">about bats is that the very fact that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:09.090" style="s2">they fly means that they are incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:11.970" style="s2">high throughput with respect to oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.090" end="00:32:14.580" style="s2">and carbon dioxide you can imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.970" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">amount of work that is necessary to keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.580" end="00:32:21.720" style="s2">a you know a small mammal in the air</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:24.810" style="s2">that that requires incredible feats of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.720" end="00:32:27.030" style="s2">both mechanical breathing but also gas</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.810" end="00:32:31.500" style="s2">exchange and in fact if you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.030" end="00:32:33.000" style="s2">the calls of flying echolocating bats if</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.500" end="00:32:37.460" style="s2">you have a detector that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.000" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">listen you wouldn&#39;t you do well sure the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.460" end="00:32:42.570" style="s2">animals echolocate under normal</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:43.770" style="s2">circumstances they echolocate in rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.570" end="00:32:45.900" style="s2">to their flight so you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.770" end="00:32:47.700" style="s2">watch them fly over and you can hear</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.900" end="00:32:48.870" style="s2">them coordinating their breathing</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.700" end="00:32:50.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re basically their flight</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.870" end="00:32:52.290" style="s2">muscles are doing part of the work of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.400" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">this basically functioning like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.290" end="00:32:58.380" style="s2">ventilator or like an accordion in terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:33:00.540" style="s2">of noise making yep so anyway the fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.380" end="00:33:02.490" style="s2">that bats have this very high throughput</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.540" end="00:33:05.400" style="s2">oxygen and that when this virus has</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.490" end="00:33:07.020" style="s2">gotten into people it has caused what</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.400" end="00:33:10.740" style="s2">appears to be a kind of oxygen oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.020" end="00:33:13.110" style="s2">starvation may not be they may be two</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.740" end="00:33:15.180" style="s2">sides of the same coin and it may</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.110" end="00:33:19.410" style="s2">suggest things that we should research</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.180" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">about it about the virus even farther</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.410" end="00:33:25.700" style="s2">afield and I really don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.970" end="00:33:28.290" style="s2">make of it but it is conspicuous that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.700" end="00:33:30.390" style="s2">chloroquine or hydrochloric Lane is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.290" end="00:33:32.610" style="s2">it&#39;s hydroxychloroquine chloroquine has</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.390" end="00:33:36.180" style="s2">been implicated as a potentially useful</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.610" end="00:33:39.030" style="s2">drug against kovat 19 which is at first</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.180" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">pass not it seemed like it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.030" end="00:33:45.180" style="s2">completely out of left field because</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:47.400" style="s2">malaria which is the drug for which this</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.180" end="00:33:51.540" style="s2">is usually used is not a virus</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.400" end="00:33:53.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a Plasmodium and so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.540" end="00:33:55.170" style="s2">these two drugs that the drug would and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.550" end="00:33:56.700" style="s2">sorry to interrupt but other than fever</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.170" end="00:34:00.300" style="s2">it seems to have nothing in common</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.700" end="00:34:03.660" style="s2">really right very little but on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.300" end="00:34:05.670" style="s2">other hand you will maybe remember from</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.660" end="00:34:08.550" style="s2">a biology course you took at some point</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.670" end="00:34:11.090" style="s2">that people who are heterozygous for</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.550" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">sickle-cell anemia so this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.090" end="00:34:15.830" style="s2">common trait in African derived</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:19.230" style="s2">populations people who are heterozygous</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.830" end="00:34:21.419" style="s2">that means they have one gene one allele</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.230" end="00:34:25.500" style="s2">for and one allele for the normal</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.419" end="00:34:28.890" style="s2">wild-type for sickle cell anemia are</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.500" end="00:34:30.870" style="s2">actually resistant to malaria so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.890" end="00:34:33.570" style="s2">just spell it out that most most people</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.870" end="00:34:36.419" style="s2">who don&#39;t derive from African</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.570" end="00:34:41.640" style="s2">populations within the last 30,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.419" end="00:34:45.660" style="s2">or so are homozygous and do not have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.640" end="00:34:48.150" style="s2">gene for in quotes and some people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.660" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">are homozygous for it and have both</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.150" end="00:34:55.830" style="s2">copies those people tend not to survive</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:57.540" style="s2">into into adulthood and reproduction but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.830" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">people who are heterozygous who got a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.540" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">copy of the allele from one of their</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.130" end="00:35:02.780" style="s2">parents but got a copy of the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.290" end="00:35:06.390" style="s2">wild-type allele from their other parent</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.780" end="00:35:07.020" style="s2">have increased resistance to sickle-cell</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.390" end="00:35:08.610" style="s2">anemia</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.020" end="00:35:10.770" style="s2">yeah wild-type is the wrong yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.610" end="00:35:12.750" style="s2">totally their function of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.770" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">type would yeah the way to say it but</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.750" end="00:35:18.690" style="s2">the reason that this is important</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:20.910" style="s2">is that sickle-cell disease is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.690" end="00:35:22.680" style="s2">named after something you can see in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.910" end="00:35:24.840" style="s2">regular light microscope which is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.680" end="00:35:26.430" style="s2">distortion of the shape of red blood</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.840" end="00:35:30.120" style="s2">cells as a result I believe of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.430" end="00:35:32.700" style="s2">hemoglobin molecule actually gumming up</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.120" end="00:35:35.220" style="s2">the cell in a way that looks sickle</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.700" end="00:35:37.410" style="s2">shaped so it creates these sickle cells</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.220" end="00:35:39.180" style="s2">now if all of your blood cells look that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.410" end="00:35:41.820" style="s2">way because you have two copies of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.180" end="00:35:43.560" style="s2">sickle cell allele you can&#39;t transport</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.820" end="00:35:45.990" style="s2">enough oxygen to survive into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.560" end="00:35:49.080" style="s2">but if you only have part of your blood</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.990" end="00:35:50.940" style="s2">compromised then you find yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.080" end="00:35:52.740" style="s2">situation where you would pay a cost</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.940" end="00:35:54.690" style="s2">under normal circumstances but in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.740" end="00:35:56.670" style="s2">place where there&#39;s malaria your blood</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.690" end="00:35:58.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t carry enough oxygen to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.670" end="00:36:01.710" style="s2">the Plasmodium so you&#39;re effectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.680" end="00:36:03.390" style="s2">immune to malaria so what the connection</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.710" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">means I don&#39;t know so I think I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.390" end="00:36:08.520" style="s2">misspoke when I was talking earlier how</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:11.640" style="s2">being heterozygous for sickle-cell gives</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.520" end="00:36:13.140" style="s2">you a slightly increased chance of being</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.640" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">sick from sickle cell anemia than if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.140" end="00:36:18.210" style="s2">have no copies but it creates a great</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:21.690" style="s2">advantage with regard to fighting off</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:23.940" style="s2">malaria I think it creates a sub</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.690" end="00:36:26.040" style="s2">symptomatic sickle cell disease which</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.940" end="00:36:29.970" style="s2">means if you were to measure the ability</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.040" end="00:36:31.830" style="s2">like you might actually gonna be a star</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.970" end="00:36:34.380" style="s2">yeah but under normal circumstances you</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.830" end="00:36:36.870" style="s2">can move enough oxygen to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.380" end="00:36:40.170" style="s2">functional so what then is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.870" end="00:36:44.580" style="s2">connection between hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.170" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">which is fighting malaria and the oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.580" end="00:36:48.360" style="s2">capacity of the blood which is manifest</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:51.720" style="s2">at a low level which is protective</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.360" end="00:36:55.620" style="s2">against malaria in heterozygous sickle</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.720" end="00:36:58.620" style="s2">cell carriers and this novel coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.620" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">effect where it is apparently depleting</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.620" end="00:37:04.410" style="s2">or seems to be depleting blood of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:06.420" style="s2">functional hemoglobin the connection I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.410" end="00:37:09.980" style="s2">couldn&#39;t spell it out but there does</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">seem to be something in that grouping of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.980" end="00:37:18.090" style="s2">observations that suggests a potential</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:20.540" style="s2">mechanism for addressing this and raises</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.090" end="00:37:23.550" style="s2">real questions about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.540" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">ventilators being applied to the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.550" end="00:37:27.700" style="s2">sick are doing more more good than harm</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.580" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">or more harm than</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.700" end="00:37:34.300" style="s2">good that&#39;s right yeah so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:38.920" style="s2">very interesting puzzle I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.300" end="00:37:40.089" style="s2">it&#39;s incredibly interesting boy I feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.920" end="00:37:44.349" style="s2">like there are a number of things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.089" end="00:37:46.359" style="s2">we wanted to go to but maybe well</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.349" end="00:37:49.869" style="s2">there&#39;s one more thing I wanna okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.359" end="00:37:53.619" style="s2">I was doing a little reading on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.869" end="00:37:55.990" style="s2">mechanistic side of Co of 19 and I ran</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.619" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">across a bunch of stunning facts about</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.990" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">how it functions it&#39;s really how the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.730" style="s2">disease functions how the virus function</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:05.980" style="s2">SARS comes to function how it gets into</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.730" end="00:38:08.230" style="s2">your cells what it does once it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.980" end="00:38:12.010" style="s2">it&#39;s really you know if you can put</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.230" end="00:38:15.869" style="s2">aside the the massive damage it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.010" end="00:38:18.190" style="s2">to humanity you have to marvel at what</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.869" end="00:38:21.339" style="s2">gorgeous feat of engineering this thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.190" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">is I mean it&#39;s just stunning and when</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.339" end="00:38:24.369" style="s2">you say engineering you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:27.070" style="s2">suggesting that it was engineered by</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.369" end="00:38:28.810" style="s2">nope engineering without an engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.070" end="00:38:32.500" style="s2">evolutionary probably this is an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.810" end="00:38:35.079" style="s2">ancient object this thing is a machine</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.500" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">that has been traveling with mammals</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.079" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">presumably for who knows how many</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">million years but probably tens maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:47.140" style="s2">hundreds of millions of years it is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">amazing object just in terms of what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.140" end="00:38:52.210" style="s2">is capable of doing automatically upon</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:55.900" style="s2">coming in contact with a cell for which</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.210" end="00:38:59.319" style="s2">it has the correct apparatus to invade</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.900" end="00:39:00.760" style="s2">but among the weird things about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.319" end="00:39:04.119" style="s2">an RNA virus which we&#39;ve talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.760" end="00:39:07.050" style="s2">bit about before it is a it carries the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.119" end="00:39:09.910" style="s2">sense strand of RNA which means that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.050" end="00:39:12.280" style="s2">genetic material inside the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.910" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">directly readable by the ribosomes of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.280" end="00:39:17.560" style="s2">the cells that it invades it has a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:20.349" style="s2">of tricks for how to take this long</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.560" end="00:39:22.900" style="s2">genome and get it transcribed by these</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.349" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">ribosomes which in general limit their</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.900" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">transcription to one protein at a time</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:27.609" style="s2">so it has to fool the ribosome into</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:29.470" style="s2">doing its bidding</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.609" end="00:39:32.710" style="s2">which it has all these elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.470" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">mechanisms for doing but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.710" end="00:39:37.670" style="s2">struck me most was apparently this thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.190" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">has an in</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:41.720" style="s2">ibly large genome for a virus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:43.519" style="s2">actually right at the limit of what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.720" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">think is possible for an RNA virus</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.519" end="00:39:47.750" style="s2">without it succumbing to so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">mutation that it can&#39;t be coherent so</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.750" end="00:39:55.220" style="s2">somehow this thing is full of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">information and why it&#39;s so full of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.220" end="00:40:01.160" style="s2">information I don&#39;t think we know yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:03.380" style="s2">but that raises all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.160" end="00:40:05.299" style="s2">possibilities about what it will do in</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.380" end="00:40:07.400" style="s2">response to the evolutionary environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.299" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">it has just discovered that is us how</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.400" end="00:40:12.230" style="s2">will it evolve and as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.700" end="00:40:15.289" style="s2">earlier you know how will it evolve both</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.230" end="00:40:17.180" style="s2">with regard to in our bodies but also in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.289" end="00:40:19.400" style="s2">the environments in which it finds us</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.180" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">you know will it become seasonal will it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.400" end="00:40:22.549" style="s2">become inversely seasonal in the north</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:25.910" style="s2">and northern and southern hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.549" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">will it do better in say humid</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.910" end="00:40:31.490" style="s2">environments than dry environments etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:33.380" style="s2">and maybe most importantly at the point</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.490" end="00:40:36.380" style="s2">that we do come up with some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.380" end="00:40:38.420" style="s2">vaccine will it be a vaccine that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.380" end="00:40:40.460" style="s2">actually addresses this virus or will it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.420" end="00:40:43.730" style="s2">be like the flu where we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.460" end="00:40:46.190" style="s2">chasing it because it has a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.730" end="00:40:47.809" style="s2">for morphing so that it is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.190" end="00:40:50.119" style="s2">effectively dealt with by the vaccine we</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.809" end="00:40:52.119" style="s2">come up with which maybe this is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.119" end="00:40:56.799" style="s2">last point I should make on on these</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.119" end="00:40:59.569" style="s2">technical side but it appears that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.799" end="00:41:01.789" style="s2">remember it&#39;s an RNA virus which means</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.569" end="00:41:05.000" style="s2">one strand which means there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.789" end="00:41:07.819" style="s2">built-in automatic mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">correcting mutational errors right if</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.819" end="00:41:11.240" style="s2">you have two strands you can always</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:13.220" style="s2">rebuild the strand based on what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.240" end="00:41:16.009" style="s2">inverse strand says in an RNA virus</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.220" end="00:41:17.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not true but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.009" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">contained in this very long genome</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.660" end="00:41:22.009" style="s2">apparently is a mechanism that is now</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:25.339" style="s2">thought to be an error correction</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.009" end="00:41:27.099" style="s2">mechanism so there&#39;s a lot to be said</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.339" end="00:41:29.990" style="s2">for what might happen if that mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.099" end="00:41:33.289" style="s2">is sometimes turned off in other words</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.990" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">for a virus there&#39;s really some moments</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.289" end="00:41:37.160" style="s2">at which it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:40.069" style="s2">to go into a high rate of change mode in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.160" end="00:41:43.250" style="s2">order to evade a successful strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.069" end="00:41:44.890" style="s2">a successful counter strategy so is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.250" end="00:41:47.509" style="s2">is there a switch to turn it on and off</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.890" end="00:41:50.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know oh that&#39;s so beautiful and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.509" end="00:41:51.390" style="s2">just it points it points once again to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:54.570" style="s2">our arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.390" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">right that that we imagined we imagined</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.570" end="00:42:00.180" style="s2">in the 1950s that with the discovery of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:03.960" style="s2">DNA the shape of DNA that we had it we</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.180" end="00:42:04.290" style="s2">knew what was going on and and that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.960" end="00:42:07.230" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.290" end="00:42:10.680" style="s2">DNA to RNA to protein boom and done</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.230" end="00:42:12.570" style="s2">right and and because DNA is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.680" end="00:42:15.090" style="s2">double-stranded and therefore has this</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.570" end="00:42:17.010" style="s2">error correction that we can all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.090" end="00:42:19.580" style="s2">Intuit that you know if you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.010" end="00:42:22.260" style="s2">strands that match each other basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.580" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">that if one mutates you can it can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.260" end="00:42:26.430" style="s2">corrected with the other I know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:29.190" style="s2">there are people who have been working</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.430" end="00:42:32.220" style="s2">on this further but at least in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.190" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">you know biology textbooks outside of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.220" end="00:42:36.300" style="s2">the research on that in particular like</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:38.010" style="s2">that&#39;s error correction that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.300" end="00:42:41.010" style="s2">is that&#39;s all that&#39;s all you need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.010" end="00:42:43.650" style="s2">know but the idea that within an RNA</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.010" end="00:42:46.440" style="s2">virus there is an error correction</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.650" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">mechanism the likes of which we can&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.440" end="00:42:52.110" style="s2">the moment neither of us can describe</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:54.150" style="s2">particularly and it may be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.110" end="00:42:57.780" style="s2">switched on and off at particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.150" end="00:42:59.580" style="s2">moments for particular situations the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.780" end="00:43:01.710" style="s2">world is stranger than we can believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.580" end="00:43:03.330" style="s2">and imagining that we are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.710" end="00:43:05.700" style="s2">simple systems that will have simple</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.330" end="00:43:08.360" style="s2">solutions will be our downfall we need</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.700" end="00:43:11.940" style="s2">to recognize the complexity and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.360" end="00:43:15.020" style="s2">admire it and work hard to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.940" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">well the other thing I would say is you</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.020" end="00:43:19.590" style="s2">discover that such a creature I used the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:21.240" style="s2">term creature loosely but you discover</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.590" end="00:43:24.540" style="s2">that such a creature exists at the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:27.060" style="s2">it starts making people sick the proper</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.540" end="00:43:28.340" style="s2">thing to do is to manage these things so</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.060" end="00:43:30.510" style="s2">they don&#39;t get into the human population</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.340" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">once the thing is loose in the human</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.510" end="00:43:36.120" style="s2">population and we&#39;re spreading it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:37.950" style="s2">each other this is a you know we are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.120" end="00:43:40.830" style="s2">going to win this battle we might</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.950" end="00:43:43.560" style="s2">eventually drive this virus to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.830" end="00:43:45.720" style="s2">extinction but well we will have lost</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.560" end="00:43:47.430" style="s2">many many people before that occurs i</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.720" end="00:43:49.890" style="s2">mean i think as you said on maybe our</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.430" end="00:43:52.200" style="s2">very first live stream it doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.890" end="00:43:54.660" style="s2">to kill us right that is that is not its</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.200" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">goal and so what would win mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.660" end="00:43:59.550" style="s2">if win for us if the only possible way</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:01.890" style="s2">that win looks for us is driving it into</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.550" end="00:44:03.750" style="s2">extinction that is a that is a much</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.890" end="00:44:09.390" style="s2">harder situation</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.750" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">to to do whereas if living with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.390" end="00:44:14.850" style="s2">extent for some number of its</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:17.940" style="s2">generations such that we can come to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.850" end="00:44:19.800" style="s2">coexist peaceably ish hopefully more</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.940" end="00:44:22.650" style="s2">like we do with the cold and less likely</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.800" end="00:44:25.020" style="s2">we less like we do with say the flu and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.650" end="00:44:29.850" style="s2">certainly far less like we do with say</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.020" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">HIV or Ebola then it was is that a win</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.850" end="00:44:34.920" style="s2">you know can can we really imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.119" style="s2">the only way to beat pathogens is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.920" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">drive them into extinction</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.119" end="00:44:40.590" style="s2">it is really unlikely and even if we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:42.690" style="s2">that with one or two we will never do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.590" end="00:44:45.840" style="s2">with all of them well therefore we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.690" end="00:44:47.220" style="s2">to rethink what our relationship is with</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.840" end="00:44:49.350" style="s2">them we do need to rethink our</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.220" end="00:44:51.450" style="s2">relationship I still say the the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.350" end="00:44:54.570" style="s2">bargain is always to keep these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.450" end="00:44:57.540" style="s2">from jumping the gap true fronts there</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.570" end="00:44:59.640" style="s2">once they&#39;re with us we&#39;re managing them</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.540" end="00:45:01.800" style="s2">at great cost to ourselves so the gap</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.640" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">that you mean it&#39;s the host gap yes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.800" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been thinking a lot I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:08.250" style="s2">been through so many discussions now</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:13.410" style="s2">about whether a bandana is an effective</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.250" end="00:45:15.810" style="s2">remedy not an effective remedy and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.410" end="00:45:17.460" style="s2">has got me thinking a ton about this now</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.810" end="00:45:22.010" style="s2">as I mentioned you know I think our</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.460" end="00:45:25.560" style="s2">first live stream before the covered 19</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.010" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">phenomenon years ago I had wanted to run</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.560" end="00:45:30.030" style="s2">this experiment with a class of students</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:32.070" style="s2">where I had them wear bandanas over the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.030" end="00:45:33.810" style="s2">winter to see if we could manage you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.070" end="00:45:36.840" style="s2">know reduce the level of common colds</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.810" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">and flu and I never did it but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.840" end="00:45:43.560" style="s2">realizing that okay I&#39;m now finally</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.570" style="s2">weeks after I started wearing this thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.560" end="00:45:47.940" style="s2">I&#39;m finally seeing other people wearing</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.570" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">them and other kinds of masks as we</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.940" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">interact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.990" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">I am wondering what this will do to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">the flu and the common cold but I also</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:02.070" style="s2">think what I really don&#39;t want to see is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">we win against kovat 19 and we forget</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.070" end="00:46:05.310" style="s2">everything we learned about how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:08.280" style="s2">been transmitting viruses to each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.310" end="00:46:10.310" style="s2">you know every winter for you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:13.350" style="s2">longer than any of us have been alive so</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.310" end="00:46:15.480" style="s2">why are we not talking about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.350" end="00:46:17.310" style="s2">this into future winters in order to</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.480" end="00:46:20.490" style="s2">just reduce the level of transmission</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.310" end="00:46:24.360" style="s2">of the flu to as close to zero as we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.490" end="00:46:26.360" style="s2">get it I really think it&#39;s a an avenue</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.360" end="00:46:29.030" style="s2">we should be thinking about reduce</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.360" end="00:46:31.560" style="s2">transmission of the flu but increase</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.030" end="00:46:36.330" style="s2">stick ups at liquor stores well of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.560" end="00:46:39.060" style="s2">course this has me thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.330" end="00:46:41.820" style="s2">something else though which is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.060" end="00:46:43.590" style="s2">seeing now a lot of people talking the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.820" end="00:46:46.230" style="s2">CDC is now talking about make your own</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.590" end="00:46:48.690" style="s2">masks they&#39;re bought there lots of hotel</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.230" end="00:46:51.000" style="s2">instructions out there I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.690" end="00:46:52.500" style="s2">it took people so long it was obvious</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.000" end="00:46:54.510" style="s2">from the very beginning that to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.500" end="00:46:56.550" style="s2">extent that anybody was saying masks</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.510" end="00:46:59.100" style="s2">don&#39;t work that they were telling you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.550" end="00:47:00.600" style="s2">that they either didn&#39;t understand or</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.100" end="00:47:02.040" style="s2">weren&#39;t being honest it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.600" end="00:47:04.890" style="s2">possibly be true that they don&#39;t work at</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.040" end="00:47:07.320" style="s2">all well or they or the argument</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.890" end="00:47:09.750" style="s2">actually was we know there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.320" end="00:47:11.850" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the capacity to make more</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.750" end="00:47:13.230" style="s2">we need them saved for the health</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.850" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">professionals who need them more than</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.230" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">you do but instead of telling you the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.690" end="00:47:21.650" style="s2">truth that you should cover your face</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:24.300" style="s2">but you should not buy or hoard these</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.650" end="00:47:27.480" style="s2">because we need them for someone else we</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.300" end="00:47:29.730" style="s2">got fed a overly simplistic and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.480" end="00:47:31.560" style="s2">wrong message but they don&#39;t work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.730" end="00:47:34.440" style="s2">but she serves no one that&#39;s covered by</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.560" end="00:47:34.860" style="s2">they&#39;re either uninformed or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:37.080" style="s2">lying</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.860" end="00:47:40.230" style="s2">that&#39;s lie and the fact is that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.080" end="00:47:42.990" style="s2">just lying that&#39;s lying that kills so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.230" end="00:47:45.150" style="s2">have no sympathy for anybody who fed us</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.990" end="00:47:46.530" style="s2">some kind of garbage message in order to</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:49.170" style="s2">preserve those masks for the health care</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.530" end="00:47:52.110" style="s2">professionals I would far prefer that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.170" end="00:47:53.610" style="s2">they had said look somehow we got caught</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.110" end="00:47:55.830" style="s2">off guard we don&#39;t have enough of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.610" end="00:47:57.780" style="s2">things their very nature is that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.830" end="00:47:59.070" style="s2">are disposable we can preserve them a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.780" end="00:48:02.220" style="s2">little bit but they&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.070" end="00:48:04.170" style="s2">enough so let&#39;s do a crash course on how</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.220" end="00:48:06.900" style="s2">you can make your own mask and protect</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.170" end="00:48:10.170" style="s2">yourself so that&#39;s on the professional</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.900" end="00:48:12.330" style="s2">side on the side of the public I have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.170" end="00:48:17.970" style="s2">say and I&#39;ll say this is gently as I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.330" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">but I believe that we have a crisis when</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.970" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">it comes to extrapolation that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.690" style="s2">have lived in circumstances where</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.690" style="s2">they&#39;re so used to having what they need</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.690" end="00:48:30.540" style="s2">delivered to them that they have in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.690" end="00:48:34.710" style="s2">sense forgotten what to do when</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.540" end="00:48:38.010" style="s2">nobody shows up to help and I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.710" end="00:48:41.490" style="s2">them bootstrap those capacities but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.010" end="00:48:43.800" style="s2">late you know weeks late on in the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.490" end="00:48:45.750" style="s2">of the most basic protections that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.800" end="00:48:47.130" style="s2">already have the materials in your house</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.750" end="00:48:50.130" style="s2">there&#39;s no question about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.130" end="00:48:52.290" style="s2">so how many people will die because it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.130" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">took weeks for it to catch on that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.290" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">could actually make your own mask and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:49:00.750" style="s2">that it had some value I&#39;m reminded and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">you saying that of one of the many</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.750" end="00:49:04.380" style="s2">bullet points that I used to go over</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:06.030" style="s2">with my students before running study</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.380" end="00:49:07.860" style="s2">abroad trips and which we did with our</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.030" end="00:49:10.770" style="s2">students on the final study abroad trip</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.860" end="00:49:14.760" style="s2">the first and only one that we ever did</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.770" end="00:49:18.360" style="s2">together in 2016 one of the points was</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.760" end="00:49:19.500" style="s2">you know sort of advising people as to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.360" end="00:49:22.320" style="s2">whether or not this was really a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.500" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">fit for them is spending five eight</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.320" end="00:49:28.620" style="s2">eleven weeks and sometimes pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:30.210" style="s2">challenging situations at field stations</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.620" end="00:49:32.490" style="s2">without regular electricity but you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.210" end="00:49:35.330" style="s2">it&#39;s really really quite comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.490" end="00:49:38.460" style="s2">compared to how most of the world lives</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.330" end="00:49:40.950" style="s2">it is this right for you one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.460" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">things I would say to them was you need</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.950" end="00:49:45.510" style="s2">to be the sort of person who when</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:46.740" style="s2">something goes wrong or when you feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.510" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">like a problem needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.740" end="00:49:52.850" style="s2">your first thought is how can I fix this</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">if your first thought is who can I ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.850" end="00:49:57.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.310" style="s2">to be more of a burden than a help here</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.120" end="00:50:00.870" style="s2">and so all of us you know this that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.310" end="00:50:03.240" style="s2">started with saying we have a we have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.870" end="00:50:04.890" style="s2">crisis of extrapolation we have a we</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.240" end="00:50:07.320" style="s2">have a crisis of self sufficiency as</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.890" end="00:50:10.920" style="s2">well people people need to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.320" end="00:50:12.300" style="s2">assume that they can have the tools on</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:15.300" style="s2">board and if they don&#39;t yet they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.300" end="00:50:16.860" style="s2">develop the tools on board themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.300" end="00:50:19.050" style="s2">address many of the problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.860" end="00:50:20.520" style="s2">are dealing with on their own and this</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.050" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">is not to say that we aren&#39;t deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.520" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">social creatures who need other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:27.330" style="s2">around us to solve problems but if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:30.330" style="s2">first thought always when encountering a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.330" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">problem is who&#39;s going to help me you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.330" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">are going to be up a creek without a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.650" style="s2">paddle which which is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:40.170" style="s2">situation to be in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.650" end="00:50:42.780" style="s2">no so the crisis has learned</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.170" end="00:50:43.799" style="s2">helplessness yeah and unfortunately it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.780" end="00:50:46.599" style="s2">runs pretty deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.799" end="00:50:49.059" style="s2">yeah I kept thinking okay what if</p>

<p begin="00:50:49.059" end="00:50:52.869" style="s2">with all its various idiosyncrasies</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.710" end="00:50:54.700" style="s2">you&#39;d been somewhere and a dirty bomb</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.869" end="00:50:57.960" style="s2">had gone off where somebody had released</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:51:00.279" style="s2">a weaponized virus in a crowded place</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.960" end="00:51:01.809" style="s2">you have a shirt would you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.279" end="00:51:03.460" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to use it would you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.809" end="00:51:05.170" style="s2">understand that pulling it over your</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.460" end="00:51:09.880" style="s2">head is not protective but it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.170" end="00:51:13.289" style="s2">better than nothing and so I also think</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.880" end="00:51:15.519" style="s2">I&#39;m watching people put out these</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.289" end="00:51:18.059" style="s2">instruction sets on how to modify your</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.519" end="00:51:20.890" style="s2">bandana so that it you know has elastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.059" end="00:51:23.499" style="s2">what the heck is this why are people so</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.890" end="00:51:25.989" style="s2">focused on a device that you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.499" end="00:51:28.390" style="s2">for a medical purpose looking like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.989" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">medical mask the fact is those medical</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:33.910" style="s2">masks are designed the way they are to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:35.920" style="s2">be disposable the whole purpose of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.910" end="00:51:38.019" style="s2">is so you have a sacrificial layer that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.920" end="00:51:39.460" style="s2">you can dispose of you&#39;re not living in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.019" end="00:51:41.769" style="s2">that circumstance you&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.460" end="00:51:43.569" style="s2">circumstance where you have a washing</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.769" end="00:51:46.119" style="s2">machine and you don&#39;t have the materials</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.569" end="00:51:47.769" style="s2">to make a high-quality disposable mask</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.119" end="00:51:50.019" style="s2">and why would you go through the effort</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.769" end="00:51:51.849" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a square of cloth and even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.019" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have this surely you have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.849" end="00:51:55.329" style="s2">bedsheet you&#39;re not using you could cut</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">it out okay right and you know I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.329" end="00:52:01.089" style="s2">people have forwarded me this this paper</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:04.029" style="s2">that says I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.089" end="00:52:06.969" style="s2">because the model they used to test how</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.029" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">effective it was was I believed not at</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.969" end="00:52:12.249" style="s2">all accurate for a situation like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:14.130" style="s2">virus that travels you know through the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.249" end="00:52:17.049" style="s2">air and water Moloch what a droplet s--</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.130" end="00:52:18.869" style="s2">but even if the worst were true in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.049" end="00:52:21.849" style="s2">paper were right and a bandana were only</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.869" end="00:52:24.009" style="s2">20% effective that&#39;s not really the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.849" end="00:52:26.589" style="s2">question the question is first of all</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.009" end="00:52:28.299" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s 20 percent effective when</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.589" end="00:52:30.430" style="s2">you&#39;re doing nothing you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.299" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">around normally nobody else is wearing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.430" end="00:52:35.049" style="s2">one how effective does it become when</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:38.049" style="s2">everybody&#39;s wearing one you know you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.049" end="00:52:39.969" style="s2">take the 20% on the intake side and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.049" end="00:52:42.130" style="s2">take everybody who&#39;s coughing has one</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.969" end="00:52:44.739" style="s2">between them and the environment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.130" end="00:52:46.509" style="s2">gonna be way up closer to 80 or 90</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.739" end="00:52:50.140" style="s2">percent for those two things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.509" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">before you get to regular hand washing</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.140" end="00:52:56.290" style="s2">before you get to having a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">a regular cycle where when you get in</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.290" end="00:53:00.520" style="s2">your car from the place you&#39;ve gone to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:02.260" style="s2">buy your food you come in and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.520" end="00:53:05.020" style="s2">sanitize your hands before you touch the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.260" end="00:53:07.020" style="s2">wheel so the more of these things you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.020" end="00:53:10.540" style="s2">the safer you are they&#39;re additive and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.020" end="00:53:13.780" style="s2">with each thing that you do that is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.540" end="00:53:15.640" style="s2">brings less efficacy there is less value</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.780" end="00:53:18.630" style="s2">and so at some point everyone makes a</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:21.490" style="s2">decision about the limits of their own</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.630" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">behavioral modifications but everyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.490" end="00:53:24.220" style="s2">needs to be washing their hands</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:25.840" style="s2">carefully well everyone a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.220" end="00:53:27.880" style="s2">percent probably everyone should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.840" end="00:53:31.740" style="s2">wearing face coverings when they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.880" end="00:53:35.140" style="s2">and you know the enemy is the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.740" end="00:53:37.270" style="s2">the perfect is the enemy of the good so</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.140" end="00:53:38.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t have an n95 mask as most</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.270" end="00:53:39.820" style="s2">people on the streets probably don&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.830" end="00:53:41.109" style="s2">this point because there aren&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.820" end="00:53:43.330" style="s2">to go around for the people who really</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.109" end="00:53:45.609" style="s2">really really need them you wear</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.330" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">something and it gives you an additional</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.609" end="00:53:53.140" style="s2">boost of production yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:57.100" style="s2">very hard to understand what people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.140" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">psychological orientation is especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.100" end="00:54:03.970" style="s2">in light of the fact that let&#39;s face it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:09.720" style="s2">civilization has come as close to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.970" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">as it can that is an amazing level of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.720" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">shift from normalcy so simply getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:21.609" style="s2">everybody to wear something to block</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:24.850" style="s2">what they may be exhaling is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.609" end="00:54:26.950" style="s2">change compared to nobody&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.850" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">work who&#39;s not in an essential job so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.950" end="00:54:31.900" style="s2">we&#39;re already making all kinds of shifts</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:35.260" style="s2">in order to prevent the spread of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.900" end="00:54:36.850" style="s2">but to me the most obvious one which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.260" end="00:54:38.440" style="s2">let&#39;s I&#39;ve meant the value of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.850" end="00:54:40.450" style="s2">masks people are wearing by getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.440" end="00:54:43.480" style="s2">everybody to wear a mask you know just</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.450" end="00:54:45.100" style="s2">as it is now impolite to shake hands or</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.480" end="00:54:48.070" style="s2">stand too close to somebody it should be</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.100" end="00:54:50.560" style="s2">impolite not to be wearing a mask of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.070" end="00:54:52.150" style="s2">some type as you walk around how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.560" end="00:54:58.290" style="s2">more effective would we be if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.150" end="00:54:58.290" style="s2">was doing it good all right</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.940" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">so other matters that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.339" end="00:55:07.160" style="s2">covering I think maybe we should sign</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:09.109" style="s2">off come back in a few minutes and do QA</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.160" end="00:55:11.480" style="s2">alright I&#39;ve got something more no so</p>
