<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:16.400" style="s2">to the migrant crisis of 2015 where he</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">a sense that the story has run out at a</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">quite reminiscent like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">has soared to public consciousness over</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:55.530" style="s2">the last couple of years with a very</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.530" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">is something that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">now waking up to once they&#39;re waking up</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">to I think they&#39;re intuiting it I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">have been for a long time and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">it takes a little bit of time to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">willing to sort of voice it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">as I said not just you may be wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">it&#39;s embarrassing to be wrong on such a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:22.970" style="s2">big thing but it&#39;s not so much that as</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.229" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">well what are you going to do about it I</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.970" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">try to just diagnose where I think we</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">are I&#39;m not particularly prescriptive of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">what I think happens now I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:41.450" style="s2">various instincts about it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">that that unmooring and more illness is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.450" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not also not the only person to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">pointed it out there are problems about</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">pointing it out because a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to accept the premise that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">I&#39;m saying there that we that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">divorced ourselves and the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve got where we have because they</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s a way to open up the door for</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">religion to come back in or unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">forms of religion to come back in or</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">very prescriptive forms of religion to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">come back in or they think you might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">doing something else</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:19.930" style="s2">there all sorts of motives you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.750" end="00:02:22.250" style="s2">ascribe to anyone pointing this out</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.930" end="00:02:25.460" style="s2">something you&#39;re you&#39;re up to secretly</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.250" end="00:02:26.870" style="s2">behind the scenes and I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.460" end="00:02:30.140" style="s2">just among some of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.870" end="00:02:32.960" style="s2">people are wary about allowing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.140" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">conversation to begin because where will</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.960" end="00:02:39.860" style="s2">it take us and I&#39;m into that one my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:42.020" style="s2">answer is I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.860" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">probably worth it&#39;s probably worth</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.020" end="00:02:50.440" style="s2">risking it with our eyes as wide open as</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:52.990" style="s2">possible rather than pretending it away</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.440" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">but yes there are the people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.990" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed similar things</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:02.300" style="s2">doubtless others you could name from</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:07.130" style="s2">Nietzsche onwards yeah I mean Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.300" end="00:03:10.880" style="s2">foresaw a lot of this as did various</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.130" end="00:03:12.890" style="s2">others I mean occasionally I get it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.880" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">happened recently in and in a BBC</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.890" end="00:03:19.190" style="s2">interview about Oswald Spengler</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">the centenary of publication of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.190" end="00:03:23.510" style="s2">great masterwork and an interviewer said</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:26.209" style="s2">well you know Spangler said some of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.510" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">you&#39;re saying a hundred years ago I said</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.209" end="00:03:30.380" style="s2">well you know there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">inevitability to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.380" end="00:03:36.350" style="s2">civilizations become unmoored and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">die or crash within say a four or five</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.350" end="00:03:44.150" style="s2">year parliamentary term you know these</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:46.700" style="s2">things may take a lot of time the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:49.250" style="s2">thing is that as it were the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.700" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">positive interpretation of what I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.250" end="00:03:52.670" style="s2">saying and the most positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">interpretation of the fact that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.670" end="00:03:56.780" style="s2">other people have said some of it before</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.410" end="00:03:58.100" style="s2">the most positive interpretation you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.780" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">could take from that would be to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.100" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">well maybe it&#39;s the case that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">often having bad diagnoses like this as</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.530" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">it were almost terminal diagnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">yet we survived and therefore maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:18.049" style="s2">this is this is it were the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2">positive point that you could make</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.049" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">against what I&#39;m saying maybe in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">case premature or possibly premature</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:31.700" style="s2">diagnosis of our own mortality as</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:36.230" style="s2">civilizations maybe something that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.700" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">us healthy could be it&#39;s not such a bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.230" end="00:04:41.330" style="s2">thing to bear in mind but I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the best-case scenario of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.330" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">in the debates with Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">Jordan Peterson you said we may be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:48.980" style="s2">the midst of discovering that the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">thing worse than religion is its absence</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.980" end="00:04:53.480" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:56.600" style="s2">is this a little bit I&#39;m reminded of GK</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.480" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">Chesterton&#39;s idea that if a man stops</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.600" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">believing in God he starts believing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">anything is what you&#39;re saying there</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:06.620" style="s2">that we we have the capacity for very</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:07.850" style="s2">fundamentalist ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:09.710" style="s2">world and we will attach them to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.850" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2">anything part of what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.710" end="00:05:14.630" style="s2">through at the moment is the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.450" end="00:05:18.950" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have very much to hold on</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.630" end="00:05:21.800" style="s2">to and by that I mean among other things</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.950" end="00:05:26.780" style="s2">that we can no longer even agree on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.800" end="00:05:28.910" style="s2">facts seems this is worse in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:30.890" style="s2">countries and others I&#39;d have thought at</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.910" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">this stage in its development America</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:37.130" style="s2">has this worst but as the Irish</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:41.270" style="s2">journalist Kevin Myers said a few years</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.130" end="00:05:43.460" style="s2">ago something I&#39;m fond of quoting he</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.270" end="00:05:45.380" style="s2">said in his memoir watching the door he</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.460" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">described a moment where he said the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:50.750" style="s2">truth had become whatever you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">having yourself now we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:05:54.740" style="s2">reaching a similar stage it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.200" style="s2">certainly Morocco is already at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.740" end="00:05:59.690" style="s2">stage you can you can see it everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.200" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">nobody can agree on what&#39;s true nobody</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">can even agree on what&#39;s happened not</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">just historically where everyone has now</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:10.940" style="s2">got their own view of history regarding</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:14.540" style="s2">their own political side but also what</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:17.030" style="s2">happened today even today&#39;s facts are</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.540" end="00:06:19.820" style="s2">disputed and not as if they ever reach a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.030" end="00:06:23.780" style="s2">conclusion now they just they just go</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.820" end="00:06:26.090" style="s2">off in different directions and and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.780" end="00:06:27.890" style="s2">think that that is a version of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.090" end="00:06:31.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a part of what I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.890" end="00:06:33.260" style="s2">when I say that that we may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.400" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">discovering that the only thing worse</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.260" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">than religion is its absence is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">people seem to be finding it extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:42.620" style="s2">hard and I don&#39;t absolve myself from</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:44.360" style="s2">by the way I&#39;m not saying that I sit in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.620" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">some unique position where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.360" end="00:06:48.139" style="s2">suffer from this I think we all do to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:49.580" style="s2">some extent but I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.139" end="00:06:52.610" style="s2">finding it very hard to know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.580" end="00:06:54.410" style="s2">you do hold on to what you can hold on</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.610" end="00:06:58.940" style="s2">to what art but is another way fixed</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.410" end="00:07:01.580" style="s2">certainties now religion in among many</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.940" end="00:07:04.570" style="s2">other things provides people erroneously</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.310" end="00:15:55.140" style="s2">underlying thing is this I think which</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2">Jordan in London gave a very moving and</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.150" end="00:25:25.850" style="s2">point I was trying to make was is that a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.300" end="00:25:28.130" style="s2">plausible attempt to reassert a set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.850" end="00:25:30.290" style="s2">very basic truths and claims that</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.290" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">ripe firt at the moment and my own view</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.260" end="00:25:40.690" style="s2">is that were quite lucky that some total</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">charlatan and shit hasn&#39;t come along</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.690" end="00:25:47.059" style="s2">with enormous power already to do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.950" end="00:25:48.410" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s less possible in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.059" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">Information Age that would have been</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.430" end="00:27:59.920" style="s2">grateful lucky but so I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.110" end="00:28:06.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s wrong to think of it as</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.040" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">an establishment anti-establishment</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.540" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">thing or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.140" end="00:28:20.419" style="s2">I&#39;m not certain that there&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:24.100" style="s2">difference between America and Europe or</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.419" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">American the UK in in terms of this I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.100" end="00:28:29.570" style="s2">know that in in Europe and the UK the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:31.159" style="s2">culture wars are fought slightly</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.570" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">differently than they are in America</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.159" end="00:28:36.049" style="s2">because the the area of contestation is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:38.630" style="s2">different and the width of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.049" end="00:28:39.890" style="s2">conversation is different and now after</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.630" end="00:28:43.000" style="s2">all there&#39;s a lot of stuff that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.890" end="00:28:45.559" style="s2">sort of pretty much for good and for ill</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.000" end="00:28:51.049" style="s2">agreed upon in Europe that is not agreed</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.559" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">upon in America so I&#39;m not certain there</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.049" end="00:28:57.080" style="s2">is any kind of transatlantic divide what</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:28:58.460" style="s2">are you thinking of if what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.080" end="00:28:59.539" style="s2">in the u.s. at the moment is that the</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.539" end="00:29:04.130" style="s2">there is a kind of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.159" end="00:29:06.350" style="s2">polarization and a lack of agreement as</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.130" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">to what even the facts consist of in</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.350" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">some sense in the UK we have a bit we</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">have the BBC we have some sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:16.340" style="s2">Civic space that is not completely</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.289" end="00:29:23.390" style="s2">so at the moment that the BBC is coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.690" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">in for endless attack and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.390" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">actually feeling the attack and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">it probably is</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.830" end="00:32:12.580" style="s2">probably is the case in Britain there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.980" end="00:32:30.250" style="s2">are you very pessimistic about this kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.810" end="00:32:32.530" style="s2">of increasing polarization or do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.250" end="00:32:37.140" style="s2">have any sense of how we pull out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.530" end="00:32:39.340" style="s2">this spiral I&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.140" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">well I&#39;m in this cause for optimism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.340" end="00:32:44.560" style="s2">pessimism isn&#39;t there as a restraint in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:47.500" style="s2">everything um I&#39;m pessimistic in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.560" end="00:32:50.370" style="s2">fact that I think that people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.500" end="00:32:55.470" style="s2">becoming so incredibly embedded and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.370" end="00:32:59.380" style="s2">irrational in their embeddedness and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.470" end="00:33:02.650" style="s2">mean I just able to say it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.380" end="00:33:04.570" style="s2">absolutely thing now I&#39;m very I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.650" end="00:33:06.760" style="s2">pessimistic about that I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.570" end="00:33:08.530" style="s2">pessimistic about what I describe as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.760" end="00:33:11.260" style="s2">tendency to talk about each other and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.530" end="00:33:13.720" style="s2">not to each other I spent part of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.260" end="00:33:17.860" style="s2">summer touring Australia and New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.720" end="00:33:20.380" style="s2">with dr. Cornel West the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.860" end="00:33:22.600" style="s2">engagements for me at any rate being</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.380" end="00:33:25.060" style="s2">that and I think for Cornell as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.600" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">being to demonstrate that people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.060" end="00:33:33.280" style="s2">totally different political traditions</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.530" style="s2">could sit on stage for hours at a time</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.280" end="00:33:37.900" style="s2">night after night talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.530" end="00:33:42.610" style="s2">important things not not dodging things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.900" end="00:33:46.360" style="s2">not ducking but being able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.610" end="00:33:48.970" style="s2">rich and meaningful dialogue and sorting</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.360" end="00:33:52.300" style="s2">some things out you know which I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.970" end="00:33:56.350" style="s2">we did actually between ourselves if not</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.300" end="00:33:59.020" style="s2">for anyone else and I&#39;m very struck by</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.350" end="00:34:00.340" style="s2">how few people do that and as obvious</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.020" end="00:34:02.170" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of reasons for why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.340" end="00:34:03.820" style="s2">happened we all know and I&#39;m afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.170" end="00:34:10.080" style="s2">the mainstream media has been a massive</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.820" end="00:34:12.340" style="s2">component of that strange degrading</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.080" end="00:34:14.260" style="s2">tendency but the thing that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.340" end="00:34:15.700" style="s2">optimistic about in it is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.260" end="00:34:19.120" style="s2">obvious that new things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.700" end="00:34:22.750" style="s2">through I mean and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.120" end="00:34:26.130" style="s2">always the way isn&#39;t it I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.750" end="00:34:31.149" style="s2">you can berate and be well as I do the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.130" end="00:34:36.850" style="s2">YouTube ization of discussion that means</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.149" end="00:34:39.870" style="s2">that the BBC or ITV or let alone some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.850" end="00:34:43.050" style="s2">the American networks will get on</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.870" end="00:34:44.940" style="s2">one absolutely shouty crazy nutter from</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:47.160" style="s2">one direction then one apps he shouted</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.940" end="00:34:54.810" style="s2">crazy nutter from another and call that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.160" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">a discussion and that I believe embeds</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.810" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">itself with a new generation of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:02.730" style="s2">who think that is discussion you can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">wailing boom own that but look what</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.730" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">we&#39;re doing now is the demonstration of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:09.030" style="s2">the opposite which as it turns out yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">that can happen and it also turns out</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.030" end="00:35:14.340" style="s2">that there&#39;s a reaction to that which</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:17.490" style="s2">means that there&#39;s an audience for long</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.340" end="00:35:22.020" style="s2">form often multi-hour discussions I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.490" end="00:35:26.070" style="s2">this so there&#39;s always there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.020" end="00:35:30.690" style="s2">both reason for optimism and pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.070" end="00:35:36.150" style="s2">in this I the thing I&#39;m most nervous</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.690" end="00:35:39.990" style="s2">about is is that we need we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.150" end="00:35:48.060" style="s2">find some way to agree on certain tent</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.990" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">pegs certain lines it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.060" end="00:35:50.840" style="s2">just very difficult as you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:54.890" style="s2">through it</p>
