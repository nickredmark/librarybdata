<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">some of the topics that came out today</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">uh so let&#39;s get right into it um peter</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">uh so one thing we&#39;re kind of wondering</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">about is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">like before we really get into like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">nitty-gritty of your philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">i was feeling kind of curious like how</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">you how you got to know nihilism like</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">what was your journey to getting there</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">right well um i guess um nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">mostly responsible for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">so i um you know started studying nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">when i was 18 in my bachelor&#39;s degree</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">and it sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">along with some of the other great</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">philosophy sort of blows your mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">completely and just makes you question</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">all the axioms</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">and um so that&#39;s the beginning of it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">also reading hume of course uh either</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">philosophy bachelors i should say</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">and um and then in london i was working</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">at college where i was teaching and each</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">is beyond good and evil his</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">one of his last books for six years and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">on top of that i was teaching um</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">um and then a nice kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">a nice kind of um connection occurred</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">where a lot of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">20th century epistemologies on ethics</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">that i was teaching sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">cohered with nietzsche&#39;s view views on</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">good good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">and um and i decided to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">just write a quick essay in a very um</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">kind of um you know forceful manner so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of style of writing which i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">don&#39;t normally do it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t normally speak like that but i</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">thought i&#39;d try a bit of hyperbole</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">but keep it as concise as possible just</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">to express</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">the fundamental aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">nature hume as you say actually from</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">schopenhauer because a lot of niches</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">works based on shopping hours</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">so i um yeah so i just wrote this quick</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">essay it was ten what eleven thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">words or so</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">put it online and um and then it became</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">a chapter in my book numerous a year</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">later or so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">um and i didn&#39;t think much of it it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">just really to put</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think it would be you know red</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">or anything but but um then out of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">blue yeah</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">writer or an ellis um he sort of based</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">recreation of karnak this this um</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">comic character superhero partly on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">animalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">and then it became uh yeah more popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">after that but then i personally sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">moved on from that as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">peter limberg was saying i sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:47.199" style="s2">then got into um</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">more shopping hours pan psychism um and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.199" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">then ultimately whitehead and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">and then i took some magic mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">which kind of changed my interests quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">considerably</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">and i got into psychedelic philosophy um</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s basically the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">cool cool thank you so what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:11.280" style="s2">neo-nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">what is neo-nihilism well okay so uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">um it&#39;s ultimately the doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">that um and this is really nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">new this was i mean you find this in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">plato with</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">characters like throughout the maccas</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">and galaxies but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">the the argument that there are there</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">are no such things as objective</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">morals objective values um but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">a sort of traditional analysis which</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">says that there are no values there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">no meaning to life and there is no truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why i added the prefix neo it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">compatible with the multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">values in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">and one&#39;s own self evaluation but</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">ultimately the ultimate point of it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">before you get into</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">all the details that any moral</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">proposition or any normative moral</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">proposition in other words when you tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">or people what they ought to do when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">issue a command or an imperative</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">um ultimately that cannot be based uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">that cannot be a truth statement it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">can&#39;t be true</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">um it&#39;s ultimately a means of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">okay cool do you want to elaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">the power bit a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">like how neo-nihilism connects to power</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">um well this is the nietzschean bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">so um there are in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">there were a number of philosophers who</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">said that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">that moral propositions like i ought not</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">to lie i know what not to steal one will</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">not steal</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">um these are either meaningless or they</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">are false</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">or non-cognitive or whatever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">different versions of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">um but they were never based on those</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">were mostly based on a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">an empiricism or a logical positivism</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">which could never like metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">uh substantiate those claims so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">in neo nihilism is i&#39;ve linked this kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">of epistemological view that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">ethical propositions don&#39;t have truth</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">value ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">to a metaphysics of power based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s will to power willism act</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">which was um which for those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">know is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">um a view that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">um at the fundamental level of all</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">and there are different interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">of this nature but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">as you find out especially in from 1886</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">onwards from beyond good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">onwards</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">um there&#39;s this notion that at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">of reality below matter even</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">there is everything strives for power</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t mean greed</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean conscious greed or power as</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">we understand it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s more akin to sort of growth but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">as as we understand it either it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">it&#39;s nietzsche calls it a pathos</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">a feeling there&#39;s a feeling a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">develop basically this is how i see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">world of power this is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">nietzsche sort of um spoke about more</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">and more as</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">as he got older and he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">going to name a book the will to power</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">then he changed it and then his sister</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">and other editors created this book of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">late</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">notes and they called it the will to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">power so this is not the book that he</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">was really planning</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">well this was not the book he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">planning to write because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">notebooks</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">but nonetheless he was planning to write</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">a book on the world to power</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">um but of course in 1889 he went</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">he suffered a mental breakdown he went</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">you know insane and colloquial</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">and uh never completed that but i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">he was on</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">he was on a mission to create this sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">of metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">of power which could substantiate</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">uh moral truth claims and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">you know and politics and and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">so i suppose yeah the po ultimately when</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">you say i mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">coming back to neonatalism then when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">say something like um</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">you know one or not to lie or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">like that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">what this is based on is power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">ultimately a person or a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">trying to tell other people um how they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">should behave</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">they&#39;re not stating a fact they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">saying you know if i said like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">table is made of wood</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">that could be that could be verified and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">or falsified and um</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">it would be a statement of fact but if i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">said one or not to lie</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">proposition is very similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">statement but of course it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">um and it&#39;s very hard ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">to substantiate that and of course there</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">are very many normative ethics</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">utilitarianism deontology so on so forth</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">but ultimately when you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">fundamental question of you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">why do you believe this if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">believe in god</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">importantly um then it comes to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">so this is in a way a continuation</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">or a kind of expression of nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">claim that god is dead because what he</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">meant by that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">not simply the fact that we you know we</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">the chris judeo christian god but rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">the important part of that expression is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">if you don&#39;t believe in this um</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">biblical god then you have if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">believe in the christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">god he says explicitly you have no right</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">to christian morals</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">and even nietzsche&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">really is criticism western culture is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">christianity explicitly most people</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">still assume</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">christian morals because they&#39;ve had two</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">thousand years to sort of embed</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">themselves within the western mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">um but ultimately this is based on god</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">as both law giver</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">and as um a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">creator that gives humanity a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">and gives each human a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">if you take away that creator and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:05.519" style="s2">law giver</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">um you&#39;re sort of left in this abyss you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.519" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">sort of 20th century existentialists</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">consider this sort of negative in a way</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">or liberating depending on who you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">but ultimately um nietzsche&#39;s point is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">if you don&#39;t believe in the christian</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">god you&#39;ve got no right to christian</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:22.600" style="s2">morals</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">and for him christian morals included</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.600" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">utilitarianism and socialism and so on</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">um and in fact any ism any ideology</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">capitalism or marxism whatever have you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve got no right to that so where</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">does that leave you</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">well if you think that values are only</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">those christian values that legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">christian values that we have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">then of course it&#39;s very negative and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">then you get into this kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">into this um melancholy abyss where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">think everything&#39;s pointless</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">but this is of course only based on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">belief that these are the only values</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">this is why nietzsche also speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">you know this distinction between master</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">and slave morality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">um you know christianity is the epitome</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">of slave morality</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">and this has been so influential that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve assumed that to be morality itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">but of course nietzsche speaks about you</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">know former moralities other moralities</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">around the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">um so it&#39;s not as if destroying these</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">western values means there are no values</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">it rather emancipates person to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.639" style="s2">number one</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">one can create the values one pleases</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.639" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">and secondly it&#39;s kind of emancipatory</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">it one doesn&#39;t take any kind of moral</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">impositions as truthful you know someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">says you should do this</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">you wonder what to do that or society</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">should be like this or we must get rid</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">or this is evil and so on you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">it makes you well immediately makes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">say why you know what what&#39;s the basis</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">upon which standard you know of morality</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">and if it is based on a normative</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">morality which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">rare but then you ask well</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">can you ultimately find this objective</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">moral upon which</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">it is based um</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">yeah so um so that&#39;s more nature but</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s implementing that it&#39;s also also</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:15.519" style="s2">i should say</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">you know you read nietzsche nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.519" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">very critical of shopping now in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">later works but then when you reach open</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">now you realize how much shopping now it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">actually influenced nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">and um anyway like so shopping how are</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">bringing in alice and bringing shopping</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">as well because he said</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">you know he was an ethicist but he</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a normative</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">ethicist and this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">distinction in that i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">in um neo-nihilism and chauvinal said</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">um the morals that we have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">are um imperative morals you know can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">criticizes can&#39;t those sort of post</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">canteen he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">criticized can&#39;t for just simply</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">assuming that morals must be in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">imperative form</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">thou shalt you know um as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">descriptive form</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">which i&#39;ll explain in a minute and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">shopping now even uses the term slave</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">morals which people just</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">attribute to nietzsche but um it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">shop an hour already</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">but nietzsche&#39;s criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">schopenhauer is that he still assumes</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">the kind of christian legacy</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">because because he thinks that well</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">these these christian values are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">greatest values and they&#39;re not true so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:22.959" style="s2">one should just simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">fall into pessimism but let me just um</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.959" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">explain this difference this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">difference then between prescriptive and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">descriptive ethics</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">so and this is the first part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">essay really</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">neonatalism um there&#39;s two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">speaking about ethics generally or one</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">can speak about them in two general ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">um so descriptively like an</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">anthropologist would go to another</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">society or look in the past and say</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">these people believe this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">ancient spartans believed this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">ancient athenians believed this and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">thought this was good and this was evil</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">and country-wise another</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">society thought complete opposite and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">you know in this society this small</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">section of the society we believe this</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just describing people&#39;s moral</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">beliefs and behaviors and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s anthropological sociological</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">but as opposed to that descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">morality</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">most people when they talk when you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">talk about ethics and morality</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">they consider it to be prescriptive so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">that&#39;s when you prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">actions when you say things um are like</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">this but they ought to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">and what this these people did was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">and what these people did was right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">and and that is what i take issue with</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">neonatalism that form of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">that um because ultimately yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">really fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">ultimately it assumes a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">platonism that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">a transcendent form of the good</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">ultimately in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">um i remember when i was phd student</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">exeter</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">every two weeks or so we had an ethics</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">paper in little</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">group of phd students and professors and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">ultimately all these all these ethical</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">papers came down to this fun</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">fundamental point you know but how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">you ultimately substantiate</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">that axiom that ethical axiom and um</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what neolinism tries to break</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">of course it doesn&#39;t prescribe any</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">actions either no it doesn&#39;t say you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">know this is not evil therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">you should do this whatever because that</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">would also be prescriptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">it just leaves you it&#39;s just sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">deletion mechanism it just sort of tr</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">seeks to at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">um obliterate this kind of belief that</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">is so prevalent still</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">so there you go that&#39;s sort of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">probably a bit messy in the wrong order</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">but those are the fundamental points nah</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s great that&#39;s great you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:46.400" style="s2">covered pretty much all the ground you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">want to get to in the interview portion</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">that was a great intro yeah why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">move on to some people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">questions because i see the chats blown</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">um yeah rain do you want to ask uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">one of your questions okay so just sorry</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna pick someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">you guys can either ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">yourself or if you don&#39;t wanna do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">just shake your head or</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">question for you if you don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">sure thanks um hi peter hi</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">um so i was wondering how how</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">neo-nihilism accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">uh different studies that have shown</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">moral stages of development</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">um you know kohlberg&#39;s comes to mind but</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">there are other</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">models that show a similar progression</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">pre-conventional to conventional to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">post-conventional and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s scientifically validated</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">and it seems to be true across</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.120" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">different uh cultures um</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">yeah how does neo-nihilism account for</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">that developmental aspect of morality</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">was it kolberg who committed suicide but</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">jumping off a cliff</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">i think it was yeah um okay yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve read kohlberg many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">um and this theory of development i mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">i would say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">how i get and this will always be my</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">answer to probably everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">like how when you talk about moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">progression</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">how do you know what the standard is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">one is progressing how is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">determined</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">um so with kohlberg it seems to he just</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">assumes</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember the details of him now</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">one is just like you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">told off at the primal level right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">later on it&#39;s um one has some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">conscience</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">whereby one doesn&#39;t care what what other</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">people think something like this right</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">but ultimately the point is this um this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">kind of theory assumes a morality</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">assumes a standard like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">greatest form of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">uh morals there are and then applies</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">that standard</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">to different societies and says look</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">this society&#39;s here we&#39;re in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">you know ideally would be at the top but</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">my question would be how do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">how do you substantiate that standard in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">how did kohlberg know what was moral in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">order for him to talk about progression</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">i mean this is this is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">question well i i can answer that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">yeah so the progressive aspect is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">based</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">on um a projected ontology</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">of an ultimate morality but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">observation that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">um people go from premoral to moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">but if you observe and study</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">descriptively they never go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">from moral to premoral or from or sorry</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">from conventional to pre-conventional so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">there is a observable linearity</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes it developmental</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">okay but that still i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">notion of um development is based</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">on a preconceived standard um and also</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">is it true that we don&#39;t go back i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">if you think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">like in england here i mean you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">about the romans and civilized romans</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">you know they invaded</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">50 bc and then they stayed until about</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">480. um</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">after that you know the saxons came they</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">were brutal you know we</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">really returned to a sort of what was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">generally considered a primitive form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">morality</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">and it took um you know thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">again to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">reattain that roman level of um</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">etiquette</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">and civil civility if you call the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">romans civilized of course i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">they were also you know extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">colonizers and imperialists of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">so but my ultimate point is that um okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">yeah you you can see developments and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">generally um</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.520" style="s2">morals change but to say they progress i</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.520" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">in a descriptive sense yeah you can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">different societies and you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">they change</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s descriptive morality as i was</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">saying and that&#39;s absolutely that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">science you know social sociology or</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">anthropology or whatever but or history</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">to say that one society is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">superior to another society</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">is a proposition that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">in any way um validated</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">so like one you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">but but i would say no we can&#39;t judge it</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">that way</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">i wish i was you on stupid but my</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:31.679" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">about all of this is when these people</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">who refer to themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">nihilists begin you know talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">and you know just being being</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">nihilist in this degrading way</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">how do you suggest um i guess ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">them would be the answer for awesome but</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">did you have um</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">another solution maybe like a through</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">the ages</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">kind of conclusion i&#39;m just how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">feel about all of this as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">um i need you said something like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">the answer to a low browse a clenched</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">fist</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">of course you can&#39;t reply that on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">line can you so that&#39;s not the question</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know i mean i just i just um</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">yeah trolls on the internet i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">just uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">just ignore them now i&#39;ve i realized</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">that number one there&#39;s just no point</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">debating anything with them because</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">they&#39;ll never concede and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s just frustrating you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">win so i just</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">just completely ignore them and and try</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">to not let it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">affect me in any emotional manner i must</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">admit i haven&#39;t received</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">that i have when i was younger i did</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">yeah but um</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">another thing about a lot of followers</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">of nietzsche and i admit this and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">i&#39;m not one myself but they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">annoying</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">you know this kind of nietzsche fanboy</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">club</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">um and nietzsche does appeal to like men</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">in their 20s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">quite often i notice that&#39;s you know i</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m guilty of that appeal to me then</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">um and that&#39;s sort of why i moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">schopenhauer and then whitehead and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">bergson people like that afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t think nietzsche was right</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">about everything at all i mean he also</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">you know personally he was in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">failure but um if you are not in a moral</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">but um yeah how&#39;d you deal with them i</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">mean i think you&#39;ve suffered from them</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">then obviously haven&#39;t you recently</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">um i don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know i just um i just</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">wish they weren&#39;t like degrading</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">because nietzsche was so pivotal to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">growing up</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just insulting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">his work yeah there&#39;s i mean he would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">ashamed and actually he um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">he was i remember nietzsche wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">the anti-semites you know he said he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">called them you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">barking dogs because he said he found</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">out his name was link some anti-semites</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">uh him as as one of their own and he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">aghast by this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">and of course he was very ashamed of his</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">sister elizabeth for marrying a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">leading ant you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">anti-semite aryan who created this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">colony in south america you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">blonde children</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">and the legacy still remains strangely</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">um but he was very ashamed of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">and i think likewise you&#39;d be ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">most of his followers today perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">me i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">um but um yeah you know uh</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">think anyone can read beyond good and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">evil and say they&#39;re a nietzschean right</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">you know they they need to prove their i</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">think they need to prove themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">question you know talk about him really</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">either critically or</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">yeah peter do you want to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">sure so do you think it could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">dangerous if neo-nihilism gains traction</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">and followers due to a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">it with uh uh i should say less</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">sophisticated colloquial understanding</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">of power that it currently exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">like might makes right type thing or do</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">you think neo nihilism is inherently an</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">elitist philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">only for the elites</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">um well i think it can get out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">and i remember actually and one one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">the reasons i moved on from it a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">bit is because um</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if this is true but someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">told me once that i think it&#39;s in mexico</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">there&#39;d been a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">number of little group who&#39;d read this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">and in a criminal manner using criminal</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">some kind of gang um so there is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">um and this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:03.279" style="s2">text is only available in print actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">there is a danger for abuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.279" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">um with regard to it being an elite</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">thing no i don&#39;t think so i think um</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">it this is i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">is really for everyone and in a way if</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">people really read and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">read this studied this there&#39;d be less</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">conflict because you&#39;d realize you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">there is no answer as to whether tea is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">better than coffee</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">know there is no fundamental fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">and in a way this would uh maybe ease</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">tensions</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">if you consider that to be desirable</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">which is of course not</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">not an objective fact i&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">spinoza at the moment and he</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">really said the same thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">there&#39;s the more one</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">knows the facts of the matter the less</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">conflict there will occur often</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">conflicts occur because</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">uh one person or one group thinks</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">something&#39;s absolutely right a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">behaves absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">another group will think this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">absolutely wrong and they&#39;ll just debate</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">but you know fundamentally neither of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">them are are right</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s not an elitist thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.600" style="s2">however of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">um it is in one&#39;s interest sometimes if</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.600" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">one was founding us</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">if i for example were founding a state i</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t advocate the reading of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s obviously in the interest</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">of a statesman states person</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">make people believe that morals are</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">objective and it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">more easy to control people that way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">course so the question</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">as to um it&#39;s whether one should</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">proliferate this is really dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">who is speaking what position they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">and they said there&#39;s no absolute</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">there&#39;s no absolute answer to even that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">i got a follow-up uh and um</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">so yeah that you kind of answered what i</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">was going to say is that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">in order to gain power one must</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">off-escape</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">their desire for power uh at times and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">given the context or the domain</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">um but would you say that having an</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">explicit um</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">awareness of power and and stating that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">you have power kind of ameliorates</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">the more pathological effects that lead</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">to the unnecessary suffering</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">um i mean this was spinoza&#39;s view that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">the you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">pers you know peace of mind is achieved</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">further understanding you know i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">if you understand people&#39;s psychology</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">you&#39;re much less willing to judge them</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">you know if you know their background</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">and so on you know you know why they</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">acting this way you know why they</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">believe this you know it sort of makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">and that stops one&#39;s own emotional</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">reaction to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">um and generally i think um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">more knowledge one acquires</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">the more peaceful one becomes really um</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">but that&#39;s not again an objective desire</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">that&#39;s if you want to become peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">if you want to achieve peace of mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">other people may want to be more</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">and get thrills and so on so forth you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">know so again it really is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">it&#39;s very very much a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">perspective um</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">so that you just cannot give general</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">answers to these questions because</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">there are no general truths uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">with regard to it in my view</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">but of course i understand this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">very contentious unusual view very</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">controversial view so most people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">um obviously people&#39;s sense of right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">is part of their self-identity so if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">start questioning that they&#39;ll become</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">you know like very defensive and think</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">well this is then i&#39;ve misunderstood you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">my whole life and my role the role in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">life and so on you know so i understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">it&#39;s the same philosophy of mind when</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">you start questioning what the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">this is my main field really flush your</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">mind you know you start questioning</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">people&#39;s you know sense of self or ego</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">or desire whatever it is you know they</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">suddenly become very very defensive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">because you&#39;re questioning a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">own identity as i say</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">um this is as well but that&#39;s what sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">of makes it more exciting you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s not there&#39;s nothing worse</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">than just people just trudging along</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">with the same old concepts right</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">so and even you know at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">it it&#39;s sort of um it&#39;s a matter for</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">but like i say ultimately um i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">although i wrote this quite a few years</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">ago now</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">um i&#39;ve never come across any refutation</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">cool not to say there isn&#39;t one i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">always open-minded to refutation</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">but i so far haven&#39;t i haven&#39;t read one</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">yeah so i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">but uh another side effect of this of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">course is that it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">makes it kind of pushes you away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">society in a way that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">personally positive</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">so when you see these great debates</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">about you know you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">or movements or whatever you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">cold distance from it all we think well</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at 20</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">early beginning of the early 20th</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">century here this is what kind of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">starting to believe now</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">uh this is the same as it was 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">ago whatever and this will move on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">you know um and that&#39;s not really i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s good to get down in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">start arguing arguing for but you can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">that with neo analysis you see because</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">ultimately neonism says that there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">you know there are no objective values</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">but there are subjective values</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">so i have my own preferences i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">want a tyrannical world you know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">want um</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">certain people to be in power because</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s i don&#39;t want like a third of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">england</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">to be owned by the old aristocracy from</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">a thousand you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">as developed a thousand years ago by</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">william the conqueror that&#39;s not in my</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">personal interest</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">so i might then you know issue decrees</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">that try to mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">these um obstacles to my own power</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">ultimately on my own development</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s abs there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">with that you know this is actually life</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">this is what life does you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">even bacteria uh they seek their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">advantage you know or their group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">advantage family advantage</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">against others you know so this is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">the way this is descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">element of reality um but if uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">you know but you know most creatures</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">have normative ethics they don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">know sharks don&#39;t say you know you</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">should swim around us now and again when</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">we get hungry this is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t do that humans can do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s um ultimately as i say in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">book somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">um morality itself is a power structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of us trying to get what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">want you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">mostly subconsciously unwittingly so um</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:29.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">you know when people put themselves on</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.440" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">moral pedestal and say this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">just disgrace or one</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">this is the ideal society you know what</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">they&#39;re really doing is they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">gain power themselves but they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">conscious of that fact you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">a way that nature works</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">through human conceptuality um but</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">ultimately it comes down to this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">cool cool sam do you want to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">uh sure and i&#39;m actually noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">uh rayne&#39;s comment just hit that pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">um i was just kind of noting to myself</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">uh when peter and rachel were having an</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">exchange that there was clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">distinction being made between uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">i&#39;d say niches that we&#39;d be proud of and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">ones that we might be more embarrassed</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a vector of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">happening there clearly not of a moral</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">and uh i was wondering is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">an aesthetic judgment</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">that&#39;s uh playing out here though reigns</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">reigns comment here</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">um just uh touched on purse&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">argument that it has to do with uh the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">uh adhere to uh those who can</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">kind of engage with logical arguments</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">in a uh good faith or accurate way or</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">rather a fallacious way so i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">there&#39;s there was definitely some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">that going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m curious what your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">uh okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">the judgment about nietzscheans one</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">might be embarrassed about i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">was yeah that&#39;s uh an</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">aesthetic judgment um i&#39;m not telling</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">them how to behave</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">um and if i were if i said you know you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">guys should shut up</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">that would be an expression of my</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">subjective valuation</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not i would not be claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an objective fact that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">have to shut up</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">that would be a contradiction but of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">course it&#39;s not wrong to contradict</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not an immoral thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">under this doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">so i could contradict myself and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">willingly deceive people</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">which would not be wrong because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">no such thing as ultimate wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">um it would just be a mode of my power</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">uh or attempted power expression</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">that answers the first little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">your question um</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">did you have a second uh question that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">you can formulate in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">proposition you you address the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">aesthetic component</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">uh quite dead on there so yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">yeah i mean anitra of course speaks a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">lot about i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">nietzsche talks about aesthetics a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">you know and tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">and the dionysian world view i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">but you know interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">i um you know bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">i became interested in whitehead after</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">nature alfred north whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">1947. and um he</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">he thinks as an as you know for</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">nietzsche there&#39;s this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">level of will to power which whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">interestingly is interested in and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">had the notebooks will the power</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">got a copy of it annotated um</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">but for whitehead uh the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">drive of the universe is more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">simply power</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s also beauty and um</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">this is an interesting component that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">i&#39;m currently looking into</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">um but i won&#39;t talk about it now i mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">that&#39;s another podcast by whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">but um i&#39;m not sure if fundamentally the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">level of reality is is power only i</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">think powers you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">ambiguous term as well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s quite reductive in a way you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">however um even if</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">you question that fundamental metaphysic</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">you know what</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">lies under physicality um whether it be</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">power us</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">an aesthetic drive or a drive to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">knowledge or something else</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">um still the fact remains that if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">a moral um uh judgment</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">or proposition like um like i said one</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">or not to murder</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">um that has to be you have to still give</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">reasons to substantiate that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">normally one thing i didn&#39;t mention is</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">this difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">between hypothetical and categorical</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">imperatives so hypothetical imperative</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">is um an is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">a means and an end expressed with an if</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">clause so like</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">you know if i if you want if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">go to jail you ought not to murder</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">people right</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">now that is um an ought that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">perfectly legitimate it&#39;s got an if</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">clause if</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">one does not want to go to jail well no</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">not to murder people</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">okay so i don&#39;t want to go to jail and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want i or not to mother</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">i also have no desire to murder people</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">but prescriptive morality um especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">issuing from kant</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">is usually devised in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">categorical imperatives where there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">if clause so it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">one or not to murder and for can if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">add an if clause</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">it suddenly becomes very subjective but</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">the neo-nihilist</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">doctrine then is that um all</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">moral propositions are hypothetical they</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">all have a nif clause</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">um even if it&#39;s implicit you know so um</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s usually you know one ought to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">follow the law</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">if one wants to live in a harmonious</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">society okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">so that most people do want to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">harmonious society where they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">use zoom and write books and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">so forth and get on with their friends</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">most people want that but of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">not absolute you know some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">want to live in a harmonious society</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">they want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">have adventure and war and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">know we shouldn&#39;t forget there were gods</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">of war in the ancient past</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">and we can&#39;t say that&#39;s immoral because</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">then that again that would be based on</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">um you know an absolute standard</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">so um this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">so you can get oughts from an if but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">can&#39;t get orts from an is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">and to derive an orc from an is is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">hume comes in of course this is hume&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">guillotine</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">the azort cap you know just because</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">something is a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it ought to be that way and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">you see this a lot you say well</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">um you know we have evolved to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">compassionate to one another therefore</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">we ought to be compassionate to one</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">i mean this is just a nonsexy secret it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">does not follow it&#39;s um you could just</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">say by the same principle say we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">evolved aggression therefore we ought to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">be aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">uh but nonetheless despite this simple</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">point um</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s often often uh committed to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">next question</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">okay uh jvt do you want to ask yours</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">gbt</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">yes i i&#39;d be glad to so peter</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">um since you mentioned bergson and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">and and of course nietzsche i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">wondering</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve already explained somewhat how</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">and his notion of beauty and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">related to that creativity</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">uh might be related to nature but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">bergson&#39;s elan vital also</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">as a kind of notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">of self-organizing emergence</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">within subjectivity in time and how that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">connects to the will to power i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">wondering you know since you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">moved on from nietzsche i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">wondering how some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">um individuals you&#39;ve studied then</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">caused you to reflect back on your neo</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">nihilism um i mean that&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">question which i couldn&#39;t do justice to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll give it a start um so the land</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">vital</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">sort of vital impulse in burgsson is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">creative impulse</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">that lies within all life for bergson um</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">there are similarities between bergson</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:38.079" style="s2">and nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">i mean you know like um in the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.079" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">sentence i think of his last bergson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">last book where is it now</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">um he says he talks about the over man</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">you know the superman you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this belief i mean nietzsche has</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">got this notion of the uberman she</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really fit in that nicely to his</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s he&#39;s very ambiguous about it um</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">translated as superman over man whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">bergson&#39;s ilan bergson&#39;s created he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">got a book called creative evolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">then as you probably know</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">and um he believes in a teleology in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">nature so that evolution is working</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s not completely random</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">but there is actually a standard</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">to which things are evolving and as they</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">meet</p>

<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">they will evolve around that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">where you get the multiplicity of</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">but then nonetheless for bugs on the air</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">there&#39;s this ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">um goal towards which the elan vertile</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">um and ultimately he says</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">you know famous in this lovely uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">sentence the purpose of the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">to create gods or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">um and so there you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">interesting analogies with nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">he also talks about bergson also talks</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">about the imminence and whitehead as</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">well you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">actually i must say i mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">nietzsche who really got me into</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">through you know with it was nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">got me into this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">um into bergson and whitehead because</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">you know the will to power really</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">is um an imminence</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">like a subjectivity not consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">but of sort of drive then of a pulse you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">know like a pathos he says</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">within all things he says at least in</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">his notebooks</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">um and this is very similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">elaine vitale in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">uh of course for books and they learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">about is not just about power but</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">actually in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">you can you can read it that way you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">know the purpose of perception is to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">more things around you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">um that are that one can practically act</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">upon</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">thus empowering a person in other words</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">or a species so like making them develop</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">more and more</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">parallels</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll also say that when i was at warwick</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">university um</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">my lecturer was keith ansel pearson</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">who&#39;s like especially some both bugs on</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">anita so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">so uh he&#39;s i&#39;m sure he&#39;s written a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">of interesting stuff about this much</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">more interesting than what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">but yeah no there&#39;s certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">parallels and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:00.560" style="s2">whitehead there&#39;s you know he&#39;s known as</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">a pan experientialist now we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">to plan psychism</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">um whereby there is this element of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">subjectivity again not consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">but there is a striving in spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">there&#39;s cannatis a striving</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">in leibniz there&#39;s a dominant monad</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">which is a striving to develop you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t and then of course in shopping</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">is will to live so it&#39;s not like a new</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">thing in nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">um i can i uh just just</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">uh just do a quick follow-up and those</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">other folks that need to get in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">but um i&#39;m just wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">so basically you said that in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">propositional terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">uh you cannot validate</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">morality but if we take john verveigh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">four different types of knowledge uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">the propositional to the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">and not just the propositional which you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">is what you&#39;re basing yours on</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">if you look at the participatory and as</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">engage inter-subjectively with other</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">that we can say that there are things</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">that we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">do and not do say and not say that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">both or not beneficial to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">as well as to the other person and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">and i think you you can you can draw</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">some lines</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">that would you know be clear you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">look at it both</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">you can look at that you know harm to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">them physically mentally</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">emotionally i mean so there&#39;s ways of of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">i think framing morality</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">uh other than just propositionally okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">i mean i should know this i haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">um for veggie but i&#39;m speaking with him</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">on the weekend so i should learn this</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">um um yeah no interesting i mean okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">so the interesting thing about uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">whitehead compared to nietzsche here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">why it talks about good and evil but</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">also in a kind of relative sense in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">which he says you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">the epochs um which strive towards a</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">certain harmony</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">and evil is the fragmentation of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">harmony</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">and um so you get a lot of you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">protest theology</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">theologians who try to uh bring back</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">christianity into this whitehead now was</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">a christian then he became uh an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">and then he became</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">theist again but never a christian again</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">but i should say this yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">for whitehead evil and fragmentation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">social of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">social purpose and you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">that because whitehead&#39;s view of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">reality was much more integrated so you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">know he talks about perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">prehension</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">so when you see something that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">part of you it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">as an individual a post and this is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">needs to be more individualistic in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">it&#39;s you know me against the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">way although he says the self is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">hierarchy of wills</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">um and so it absolutely is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in one&#39;s interest to harmonize um</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">with others around one harmonize with</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">ultimately um however two things i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">against that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">number one a lot of people would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">propositional formats but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s it&#39;s selfish it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">altruism ultimately it&#39;s egoism isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">you know is in my benefit that i get on</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">with everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">now some people would um you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">certain moralists would say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not a problem around you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">selfishness you know disguise the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">another thing is second aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">um what is beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">to one&#39;s group one&#39;s family nation or</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s sometimes um antagonistic towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">another group</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">um so like um</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like uh you know sharing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">water amongst certain number</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">in in one&#39;s group um of course that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">would be antagonistic to another group</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">we wanted that water</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">and now of course ultimately if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">shared it all let&#39;s say then there would</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be enough water for all</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">so you&#39;d have to make this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">um distinction that um morality then is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">is um conducive to a group a social</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">harmony</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">um but it can&#39;t be conducive to all you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">know because ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">uh there&#39;s composition for resources and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">differences and desires like i said</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">before you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">we assume that peace and harmony is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">everyone wants but i wouldn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">look at history</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">and around the world you do that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">necessarily the case</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">and even if it were the case how could</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">you prove that to be an objective fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">that one all ought to aim for peace and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:39.839" style="s2">harmony now i say this</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">you know purely uh uh rationally of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.839" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">course i myself</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">i think i&#39;m very sort of harmonious with</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">my friends and family and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">the little village living here in</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">cornwall and so on you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">um but i still maintain</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">that ultimately you can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t sanction this you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">ultimately you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">um and that you know can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">to stopping conflict as i say sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">but at the same time why would you want</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">to stop conflict you know this is again</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">another moral</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">you know um conflict you know we would</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">not have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">as again nietzsche but we would not have</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">evolved into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">complex organisms that we are were it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">not for many</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">obstacles obstacles and conflicts down</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">the road</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">you know he doesn&#39;t think suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">bad necessarily a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">you know or obstacles are a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">this is again a form of a christian</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">a legacy of christianity well we need we</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i just want to say that one</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">thank you when i was on</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">i mentioned the concept of antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">cooperation as peter well knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">i just want to leave that there i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">look into that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">good question thank you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">squeeze in one more question i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">before the hour um</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">dan do you want to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">about sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">uh sure let me see if i can find it here</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.839" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s been a very active okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">if uh if power</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">is the driving ethos in neo nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">is this philosophy inherently unethical</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">amoral perhaps even sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">lacking a system of meta values</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">such as interpersonal dignity collective</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">and personal integrity personal</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:34.000" style="s2">integrity kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">integrity with self and also intel</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.000" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">integrity with</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">with the ecosystem um</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">i&#39;d say yes it is an amoralism yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">um with regards to the other things i</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you mean by meta values</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">can you elaborate on that um it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">something that came up in a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">again i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m saying his</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">name correctly greg and enriquez</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">who&#39;s a uh a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">uh that was in a a dialogue or a</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">with um john verveiki</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">as well as jordan hall and this was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">this was something he introduced the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">introduced as a system i guess a system</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">i guess if you&#39;re going to have what</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">what john vervinky calls this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">opening or this unconditional love or</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">then then having a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">system of meta values helps</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">for the cohesion social cohesion and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">and communitas and and cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">collaboration and things of this nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">okay uh well i just i mean i would call</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">those mental values just values</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s just not a good class</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">of it um</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">you know does it if you ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.040" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">does this lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">sort of um halting of cooperation and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">um it can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:14.559" style="s2">but but needn&#39;t but if it does</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">who&#39;s to say that is wrong i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.559" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">like meta there&#39;s sort of the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">that you know there are we you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">again it&#39;s an assumption of morality</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">saying that cooperation is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">integration is a good thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">being you know um golden rule is a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">thing i mean this is uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">this is exactly what i&#39;m questioning i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">saying how do you substantiate those</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">claims</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">you know it&#39;s complete control or delete</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">i mean i i mean i i hear you on one</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">perspective but you can have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">for exa</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">i forget what like if you take the gini</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">coefficient if you i forget if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">one or a zero</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have a million people</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">in a community and that one person in</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">the community has</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">absolutely all of the power and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">else has</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">no power no wealth um</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">you could look at it from the stand i</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">mean one measure</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">you could say is that society going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">or is it going to let you know you there</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">are some</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">measure is it resilient is it going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">in you know in the in the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">okay i mean this is a descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">question though isn&#39;t it still it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">well this probably won&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s just the way it is um but if</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:31.280" style="s2">you were to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">therefore that tyrant or whatever ought</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.280" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">to distribute his wealth</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">resources or whatever um you know you</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">know</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">and then if he does want to survive</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:28.839" style="s2">which you presume you would then he</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">um and also from those</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">beings that are under him of course they</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.599" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">would want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">denigrate destroy his power and you can</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">but ultimately there&#39;s no um objective</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">transcendent standard by which you say</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.400" style="s2">you know all power should be distributed</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">equally this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.400" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">this is not a fact of the world</p>
