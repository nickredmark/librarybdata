<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">heart beating when you get it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">not gonna be one of those sweet awesome</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:07.830" style="s2">you get the harder the beating gets the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">good thing don&#39;t we look at the numbers</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">Olivia was wonderful doctors and nurses</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">were just so professional and they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">already seen so many men in my age that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:42.229" style="s2">they could tell right away where my</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">problem was and they helped me</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.229" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">differentiate between what is eerie and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">weird about it what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">dangerous which is what&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">know right so the couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">are truly dangerous the other things</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">even if they hurt or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">uncomfortable you can just ignore them</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">that was all I needed to know at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">stage and then I felt fine and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">of a couple of days later I realized</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:06.270" style="s2">that okay that was that was the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">is probably gonna get he&#39;ll be shaky</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.270" end="00:02:12.520" style="s2">right from now on but I&#39;m terrific great</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:15.070" style="s2">okay yeah you sound good so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.520" end="00:02:18.370" style="s2">the last time we talked we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.070" end="00:02:21.400" style="s2">little bit about coronavirus and and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.370" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t have too much to say about like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:25.780" style="s2">you know what was really going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">because perhaps we didn&#39;t know yet is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">there anything is there anything you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">want to say about that about like what</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:36.070" style="s2">patterns were seeing what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">what&#39;s you know on let&#39;s say on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.070" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">level of you know just society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.340" style="s2">reaction to this thing and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:47.140" style="s2">you&#39;re concerned with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.340" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">digital the fact that we&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.140" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">digital age and when a pandemic comes oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s okay it&#39;s okay everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">well let&#39;s go let&#39;s go with the timeless</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">stuff number one thing even if I had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:02.230" style="s2">bad coffee 19 last week I can assure you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:03.880" style="s2">that the damage done about the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.230" end="00:03:06.040" style="s2">itself and the current hysteria is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.880" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">be way WAY worse the disease itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.040" end="00:03:10.660" style="s2">we&#39;re probably gonna arrive at a disease</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:12.820" style="s2">that kills it most 0.2% of the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.660" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">who are affected by it and most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:17.530" style="s2">will be affected by it I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:19.300" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a vaccine in years so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">the countries that are now slowly moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.300" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2">towards hard immunity are actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">making the clever moves this is April 20</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.660" end="00:03:26.230" style="s2">2010 like Sweden and I realize that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.050" style="s2">sooner or later this probably has a sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.230" end="00:03:31.630" style="s2">of flush to the the the the general</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.050" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">population let&#39;s just save the 80 year</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.630" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">olds and older as much as we can and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:36.910" style="s2">make them stay away because they will</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">not transfer the virus from one another</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.910" end="00:03:42.190" style="s2">if there&#39;s no virus around so we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.530" style="s2">probably have the luxury of saving the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.190" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">people who are at most risk but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.530" end="00:03:48.700" style="s2">other ones of us in society the 70 or</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:50.530" style="s2">80% needed to reach herd immunity the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.700" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">younger healthy people need probably to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.530" end="00:03:54.990" style="s2">go through this for us to arrive in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:57.250" style="s2">good place we can say it&#39;s over but</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.990" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">having said that that&#39;s just paddy me</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.250" end="00:04:01.270" style="s2">ology we know pandemics from before they</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:02.380" style="s2">have happened on this scale they</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.270" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">happened about seven or eight times</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.380" end="00:04:06.910" style="s2">every century so we should have be much</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:10.840" style="s2">better prepared we should have expected</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.910" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">this the countries that need a SARS 15</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.840" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">years ago were much better parent than</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:15.700" style="s2">the countries that be lucky enough lots</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.230" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">have seen this for the last 30 years so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.700" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">so we have these pandemics in the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:22.450" style="s2">and the 1960s they killed far more</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:24.280" style="s2">people than could the coronaviruses done</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.450" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">now so what is the difference yet well</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.280" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">we are arriving the Internet age</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:29.850" style="s2">starting in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:31.530" style="s2">the 1980s and there are no cameras</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.850" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">everywhere the microphones everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.530" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got 8 billion people on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">planet more or less connected through</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">the smartphones and laptops to having</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">their own megaphones you know screaming</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">at the top of the lungs about anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">the reactive so we have sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:49.800" style="s2">massive reaction across the world when</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:52.350" style="s2">tons of conspiracy theories and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">kinds of weird shit going on when people</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">speak their minds and fantasize about</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and this has made the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">pandemic way worse than it could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.900" style="s2">been if you just kept it as a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">introduce it that way we&#39;re spending far</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.900" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">too much energy on the Asteria</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">that we should and we&#39;re not spending</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">enough energy is still on the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:16.140" style="s2">that we should that&#39;s the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">we&#39;re now living in an age what we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.140" end="00:05:23.760" style="s2">to be confronted with that the lesson to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">be learned afterwards from 2020 what was</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.760" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">that we live in an age of hysteria we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.190" end="00:05:30.540" style="s2">in an age of mass psychosis so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:33.750" style="s2">gonna be a major problem that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.540" end="00:05:35.460" style="s2">solve of course we all learn from</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.750" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">previous experiences we can all if</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.460" end="00:05:38.190" style="s2">something like this happens the future</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:40.920" style="s2">could all go back I said well we did</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.190" end="00:05:42.330" style="s2">that in 2020 and and those things for</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.920" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">the right things that would be but those</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.330" end="00:05:45.630" style="s2">things for the terrible things that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">did those things were the ones that</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.710" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">most countries then we get a much worse</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.939" style="s2">pandemic that is of course the Pathak</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.379" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">lesson to be learned so the Pathak</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.939" end="00:07:27.999" style="s2">narrative here is quite simple it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:30.699" style="s2">shock lakhan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.999" end="00:07:32.710" style="s2">the real strikes you it did it September</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.699" end="00:07:35.889" style="s2">11 it did with the Lehman Brothers</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.710" end="00:07:37.839" style="s2">banking crisis 12 years ago and he did</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.889" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">so now again even worse because this</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.839" end="00:07:41.649" style="s2">time around it was the chaos goddess</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">herself was nature itself that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.649" end="00:07:46.029" style="s2">struck us so that&#39;s the Pathak narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:47.889" style="s2">of this but the problem is instead of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.029" end="00:07:50.349" style="s2">going for the Pathak narrative towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.889" end="00:07:53.289" style="s2">logos which is like okay how do we then</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.349" end="00:07:56.110" style="s2">solve the problem okay what resources do</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.289" end="00:08:00.689" style="s2">we have since we came so ill-prepared so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.110" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">how do we minimize deaths how do we push</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.689" end="00:08:06.610" style="s2">the transfer all transmit of this virus</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:08.620" style="s2">forward from as many people as possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.610" end="00:08:10.149" style="s2">so we can start handling it before</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.620" end="00:08:12.990" style="s2">actually the general population gets it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.149" end="00:08:15.490" style="s2">you know how do we how do we optimize</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.990" end="00:08:17.469" style="s2">whatever resource we have to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.490" end="00:08:21.939" style="s2">the damage done seems like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.469" end="00:08:25.449" style="s2">crisis of authority it&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.939" end="00:08:27.939" style="s2">the point the hysteria means we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.449" end="00:08:30.759" style="s2">go from pathos - logos we went from</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.939" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">pathos to mythos so what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.759" end="00:08:36.099" style="s2">that media took over this and what media</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.810" style="s2">always do they totally mythical media</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.099" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2">will always put the journalists where</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.810" end="00:08:42.639" style="s2">the storm looks the worst so if a</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.319" end="00:08:52.449" style="s2">is the most damage done so even if most</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:00.840" style="s2">blows to hardest and where most damage</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.350" end="00:09:04.900" style="s2">has been done yeah so we&#39;re strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.840" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2">people in the hospital dying of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.900" end="00:09:09.340" style="s2">when we got those pictures from Italy</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.990" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">and you know mass graves and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.870" end="00:09:29.260" style="s2">the media created was mythos it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.230" end="00:12:08.190" style="s2">him I can swear the countries that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">handle this the best this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.190" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">culture test huge culture test the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:16.290" style="s2">countries to have this the best they</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:18.360" style="s2">even when you compare the data they</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.290" end="00:12:21.060" style="s2">moved into logical narrative and stayed</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.360" end="00:12:25.500" style="s2">there so far it&#39;s looking very much like</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.060" end="00:12:26.550" style="s2">in Germany Japan possibly New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.500" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">they&#39;re also lucky because they were in</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.550" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">Ireland Taiwan same thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.970" style="s2">country so far the lowest number death</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:34.770" style="s2">cases well they have to eventually move</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.970" end="00:12:36.330" style="s2">towards herd immunity but since they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.770" end="00:12:37.670" style="s2">it ladies anybody else at least they did</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.330" end="00:12:40.589" style="s2">better than everybody else did</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">okay the people who didn&#39;t react to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.589" end="00:12:45.089" style="s2">the people that had sensationalist media</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:47.220" style="s2">dominating the landscape and pull the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.089" end="00:12:49.829" style="s2">politicians into that rearm like Belgium</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:52.200" style="s2">which is the big disaster zone in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.829" end="00:12:55.170" style="s2">right now early April those countries</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.200" end="00:12:57.480" style="s2">had way more damage way more deaths way</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.170" end="00:12:59.820" style="s2">more sick people way more fighting over</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.480" end="00:13:02.940" style="s2">ventilators way more disaster than</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.820" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">anybody else so if you stay with you the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.940" end="00:13:08.070" style="s2">logos in the middle of a crisis you will</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:10.920" style="s2">always be better off than if you jump</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.070" end="00:13:13.170" style="s2">onto the mythos because mythos is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.920" end="00:13:16.050" style="s2">what you need when you&#39;re in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.170" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">of a crisis hmm this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.050" end="00:13:20.339" style="s2">perfect sample of how logos and mythos</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:22.559" style="s2">and path are served if</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.339" end="00:13:25.860" style="s2">purposes but as human beings we very</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.559" end="00:13:27.720" style="s2">often mix them up so Sochi mythos should</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.860" end="00:13:30.089" style="s2">just be out of the way you know at this</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.720" end="00:13:31.559" style="s2">point kids had nothing to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.089" end="00:13:33.389" style="s2">to begin with people I said that we need</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.559" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">to talk to the kids and tell them what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.389" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">going on no you just get the kids out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:38.939" style="s2">the way send them back to school</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:41.129" style="s2">that&#39;s what Sweden did keep the kids in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.939" end="00:13:42.870" style="s2">school because if you keep the kids in</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.129" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">school you get way more nurses donut</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.870" end="00:13:45.800" style="s2">stayed on with the kids who can actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:48.749" style="s2">still go to work and save people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:50.459" style="s2">right the police force Harris</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.749" end="00:13:52.709" style="s2">Scandinavia the nurses the doctor said</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.459" end="00:13:55.290" style="s2">please let her keep our kids at school</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.709" end="00:13:57.540" style="s2">because then we can still go to work you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.290" end="00:13:59.069" style="s2">closed down the schools we had to take</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.540" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">care of the kids I also have to leave</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.069" end="00:14:02.069" style="s2">the kids with the grandparents which</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">means risking the grandparents life we</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.069" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">knew early in this pandemic that it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:08.730" style="s2">all about the grandparents and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:11.309" style="s2">retirement homes we knew that early on</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.730" end="00:14:13.740" style="s2">and still even here in Sweden they</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.309" end="00:14:15.209" style="s2">messed up about their time at homes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.740" end="00:14:17.459" style="s2">that&#39;s where the vast majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.209" end="00:14:19.439" style="s2">are dying right now oh really</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.459" end="00:14:20.850" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what we should have</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.439" end="00:14:22.379" style="s2">protected we should have locked down all</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:24.029" style="s2">the society we should have just put a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.379" end="00:14:25.379" style="s2">ring around their time and homes tried</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.029" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">to save the lives of the elderly for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.379" end="00:14:29.370" style="s2">few months to keep them away and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:31.309" style="s2">let this virus move through society that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.370" end="00:14:33.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what we should have done any</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.309" end="00:14:35.730" style="s2">epidemiologist would say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.870" end="00:14:37.410" style="s2">what should have been done all along but</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.730" end="00:14:40.319" style="s2">instead people went for this massive</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:42.660" style="s2">lockdown alcohol consumption is up</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.319" end="00:14:45.899" style="s2">violence in homes is up people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.660" end="00:14:47.490" style="s2">becoming unemployed the mess we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.899" end="00:14:50.339" style="s2">have to clean up the sort of social</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.490" end="00:14:52.290" style="s2">economic crisis we&#39;re gonna be in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.339" end="00:14:56.040" style="s2">Europe by July and August it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.290" end="00:14:57.569" style="s2">absolutely massive hmm and I expect that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.040" end="00:14:58.980" style="s2">the European Union is gonna take a heart</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.569" end="00:15:01.829" style="s2">beating and probably fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.980" end="00:15:03.389" style="s2">definitely the euro so we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.829" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">a huge crisis we already have this</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.389" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">almost civil war in Europe between</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:07.800" style="s2">northern Europe and southern Europe is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">already starting right in la crise</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.800" end="00:15:13.589" style="s2">already started and it&#39;s all about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">gonna pay for all this yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.589" end="00:15:17.429" style="s2">we&#39;re printing money like mad and at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.339" style="s2">end of the day somebody&#39;s got to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.429" end="00:15:22.050" style="s2">it and if there&#39;s one thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.339" end="00:15:23.490" style="s2">tell the kids to be honest about is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.050" end="00:15:25.949" style="s2">the current model says that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.490" end="00:15:28.259" style="s2">printing the money to save our asses to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.949" end="00:15:30.929" style="s2">save the economy save our own lives you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.259" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">know if you get unemployed you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.929" end="00:15:34.040" style="s2">gonna kill you so for that reason rather</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:36.500" style="s2">load a virus do it for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.040" end="00:15:38.450" style="s2">so to minimize the current damage we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.500" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">need to calm down and get the stereo out</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.450" end="00:15:42.470" style="s2">of the way as quickly as possible and go</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:43.970" style="s2">back to normal because we can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:46.400" style="s2">the lockdown situation for much longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.970" end="00:15:48.080" style="s2">yeah right yeah when are people gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">start writing on the street so that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.080" end="00:15:55.340" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know but Oh America is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:58.790" style="s2">already inside their own private little</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.340" end="00:16:02.030" style="s2">worlds yeah yeah so I would expect this</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.790" end="00:16:04.370" style="s2">is a guess qualified guess from from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.030" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">complexity theorist but it&#39;s a guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:09.770" style="s2">we&#39;re early April I would say places</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:12.350" style="s2">like Russia Turkey Algeria Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.770" end="00:16:14.090" style="s2">Indonesia country used to call the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.350" end="00:16:16.520" style="s2">merging market countries mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.090" end="00:16:18.230" style="s2">they can afford to give antibiotics to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.520" end="00:16:21.140" style="s2">people and they probably done it way too</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.230" end="00:16:24.080" style="s2">much so they&#39;ve got a major antibiotics</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.140" end="00:16:25.790" style="s2">resistance problem but there&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.080" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">vast majority of people who Moody&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.790" end="00:16:29.330" style="s2">middle classes are still poor and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:31.430" style="s2">have no health protection just because</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.330" end="00:16:32.870" style="s2">that means there&#39;s a small minority or</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.430" end="00:16:35.830" style="s2">wealthy people who will buy their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.870" end="00:16:37.730" style="s2">ventilators to secure their fine and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.830" end="00:16:39.530" style="s2">everybody else will be left behind in</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.730" end="00:16:41.240" style="s2">those countries that&#39;s where the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.530" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">mess will be created and I expect the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.240" end="00:16:46.130" style="s2">most political of you but it could get</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:48.260" style="s2">really messy in American Europe to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.130" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">this this is probably the most drastic</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.260" end="00:16:53.510" style="s2">economic crisis and going into since</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:55.010" style="s2">1929 and we know for yourself sorry</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.510" end="00:16:57.410" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna get messy and could go</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.010" end="00:16:59.930" style="s2">violence is this is this are we heading</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:02.810" style="s2">into a great kind of depression or are</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.930" end="00:17:05.140" style="s2">we heading into more like totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.810" end="00:17:09.230" style="s2">social control or are we heading into</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.140" end="00:17:13.010" style="s2">those are some kind of possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.230" end="00:17:15.560" style="s2">let&#39;s say you know anything good to come</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.010" end="00:17:18.020" style="s2">out of this some kind of like what wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.560" end="00:17:18.920" style="s2">here the longer we stay within myth us</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.020" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">the worse it gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.920" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">so yeah well maybe a sooner we move over</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:25.850" style="s2">to logos to better cats and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:28.910" style="s2">Jordan Peterson would agree with me the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.850" end="00:17:30.770" style="s2">authentic phallus is logical so logos is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.910" end="00:17:32.780" style="s2">with the authentic fellows whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.770" end="00:17:34.850" style="s2">false fellows the false leader steps</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.780" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">forward is mythical that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.850" end="00:17:39.560" style="s2">false follows will unite us by just</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:41.450" style="s2">pointing out the virus of course as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.560" end="00:17:43.790" style="s2">object which is correct that&#39;s after all</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.450" end="00:17:46.790" style="s2">a perfect addict but then move that add</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.790" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">it on to somebody else so it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.790" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">already in China</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">early April they&#39;re they&#39;re going after</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:54.260" style="s2">Russians and the going after Africans</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:17:55.550" style="s2">the going after anybody doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:17:59.000" style="s2">like a Chinese person these days in</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.660" end="00:19:49.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a new idea possibly including</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:52.850" style="s2">in the new book we&#39;re working on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.640" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">that&#39;s you know the deeper we dig into</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.850" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">mimesis and it&#39;s you and me and Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:58.340" style="s2">Hamrick they really are having these</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.030" end="00:20:00.800" style="s2">conversations sort of sort of off soon</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.340" end="00:20:01.580" style="s2">in between each other and we should have</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.580" end="00:20:06.020" style="s2">and record stuff with him too because he</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.950" end="00:20:08.090" style="s2">hasn&#39;t great a lot of great stuff to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.020" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">on this and he started Girard for a deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.090" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">view and if you study early on Girard</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:15.590" style="s2">and the great anthropologist of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:19.040" style="s2">century and and you discover after that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.590" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">mimesis is a so fundamental to nature</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.040" end="00:20:24.380" style="s2">it&#39;s both instinct its drive</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely desire mimetic desire it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.380" end="00:20:27.290" style="s2">could even possibly be part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">transcendence to you I mean all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.290" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">different photographs you talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">art psychoanalytical version of of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:37.100" style="s2">drives has mimesis an abyss is so</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:39.050" style="s2">prevalent everywhere and mimics is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.100" end="00:20:40.610" style="s2">essentially just what we do as kids we</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.050" end="00:20:42.500" style="s2">see somebody do something and we just</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.610" end="00:20:44.060" style="s2">mimic them we try to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.500" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">and then we might do our own little</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.060" end="00:20:47.320" style="s2">personal version of it but we still</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.360" style="s2">mimic what other people do and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.320" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">resolution relation arts fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.360" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">idea is that mimesis is so grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:59.000" style="s2">us that we also mimic our own desires so</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:00.710" style="s2">we look at what somebody else wants and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.000" end="00:21:02.660" style="s2">we have a fantasy about what they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.710" end="00:21:05.300" style="s2">and they we make it our own desires so</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.660" end="00:21:08.150" style="s2">he once that he wants a red sports car</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.300" end="00:21:09.980" style="s2">up then I want a red sports car then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.150" end="00:21:11.870" style="s2">cover that over we cover that over and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:13.310" style="s2">we firmly believe that we found out for</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.870" end="00:21:15.920" style="s2">ourselves to wander in sports car yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.310" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">or where we&#39;re attracted to a woman or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.920" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">man because we&#39;re attracted to them</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:21.950" style="s2">whereas if somebody else is involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.500" style="s2">that third person will make that person</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.950" end="00:21:26.300" style="s2">seem you know exponentially more</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.500" end="00:21:28.310" style="s2">attractive if they&#39;re bullied rancid</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.680" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">so we mimic him yeah we mimic him simply</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.650" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">because he becomes an idol he he has</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:01.430" style="s2">some ears some magical quality that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:03.110" style="s2">don&#39;t understand which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.430" end="00:22:03.890" style="s2">sexuality and as kids we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.110" end="00:22:06.020" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.890" end="00:22:07.490" style="s2">so we mimic him and we mimic him and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.020" end="00:22:09.920" style="s2">may give me hope that we one day it can</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.490" end="00:22:11.780" style="s2">be like him and then one day we discover</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.920" end="00:22:13.670" style="s2">we cannot be like him and we give up on</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.780" end="00:22:15.410" style="s2">that because our penis grows and our</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.670" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">vaginas growing suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.410" end="00:22:19.790" style="s2">grown-ups and we are a dollar cents and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.230" style="s2">and suddenly we have deal with our</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.790" end="00:22:22.850" style="s2">teenage years and that&#39;s of course the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.230" end="00:22:24.680" style="s2">genius rebellion which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.850" end="00:22:26.870" style="s2">called the the rebellion against the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.680" end="00:22:29.030" style="s2">phallus we break where the father</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.870" end="00:22:31.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t want hit his dick neither</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.030" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">inside of us or between our legs so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.190" end="00:22:37.340" style="s2">become young men and young women and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">then we still mimic because then we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.340" end="00:22:42.860" style="s2">to make our own version of what father</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">and mother were this is just mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.860" end="00:22:50.300" style="s2">again so as grown-ups we mimic the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">priest and the priest we still mimic the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.300" end="00:22:54.980" style="s2">lesser gods and then we assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.460" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">lesser gods mimic the higher god mmhmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.980" end="00:23:00.290" style="s2">yeah just like we just we just skip it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:02.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like viruses it&#39;s just like we push</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.290" end="00:23:06.310" style="s2">it through those eyes now your deal of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">mimesis yeah so that we undisturbedly</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.310" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">can mimic what we&#39;re obsessed to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:15.800" style="s2">making at the moment mm-hmm and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.890" end="00:23:17.390" style="s2">what we do as one of the important</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.800" end="00:23:18.620" style="s2">things about that dynamic is that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.390" end="00:23:21.560" style="s2">hide it from ourselves that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.620" end="00:23:24.440" style="s2">actually doing it exactly now remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.560" end="00:23:26.150" style="s2">how how eerily reminiscent this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:28.820" style="s2">for you compared to Jacques Lacan</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.150" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">psychoanalysis and the real mm-hmm that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.820" end="00:23:31.700" style="s2">the real is something we hide all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.380" end="00:23:34.370" style="s2">time because we&#39;re obsessed with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.700" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">symbolic and imaginary so the imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.370" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">or the emotional is what we feel and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:40.190" style="s2">what we make up our fantasy about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">world we make up this embolic is how we</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.190" end="00:23:45.380" style="s2">then put language onto that and name sit</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.190" end="00:23:47.780" style="s2">and gives word things so that then we</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.380" end="00:23:50.300" style="s2">believe it the way we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.780" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">something or or or make art about it or</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.300" end="00:23:54.530" style="s2">the way we use language about it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:56.450" style="s2">reality okay that&#39;s a symbolic reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.530" end="00:23:58.040" style="s2">that we vent and we have a symbolic and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.450" end="00:23:59.330" style="s2">imaginary and we jump in between these</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.040" end="00:24:00.530" style="s2">two until the fool ourselves into</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.260" end="00:26:00.710" style="s2">about the early tribes and they&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.710" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">talked about early tribes are they</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.600" end="00:26:06.409" style="s2">settled or than the move the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:08.630" style="s2">difference here is not that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.409" end="00:26:10.490" style="s2">tribe the fundamental difference is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.630" end="00:26:12.289" style="s2">that it&#39;s older than Christianity the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.490" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">fabulous difference is do you discuss</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.289" end="00:26:15.740" style="s2">people who settled in the river valleys</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:18.260" style="s2">or in the mountain somewhere so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.740" end="00:26:19.789" style="s2">settled the big difference for human</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.309" end="00:26:26.659" style="s2">rheumatic to settled okay we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.280" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">dealing with that shit we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.659" end="00:26:29.390" style="s2">dealing with the fact that we settled</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.190" style="s2">down we still dealing with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.390" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">we have to travel in our ideas and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.190" end="00:26:36.049" style="s2">need to go to the gym every day to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:37.550" style="s2">exercise because otherwise we get killed</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.049" end="00:26:40.340" style="s2">for viruses that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.550" end="00:26:42.380" style="s2">so you know we deal with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.340" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">we decided to settle down ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.380" end="00:26:46.130" style="s2">years ago and increasingly did so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:47.900" style="s2">because we could breed more children and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.130" end="00:26:49.610" style="s2">grow larger populations because of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.900" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">and only because the populations got</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.610" end="00:26:54.050" style="s2">larger we settled that model one we</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:57.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t pick that model we didn&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.050" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">it but we did so we&#39;ve got a model where</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.710" end="00:27:03.260" style="s2">we were constantly pneumatically on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:05.420" style="s2">move in a physical landscape and with</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.420" end="00:27:10.790" style="s2">invented the only major idea besides the</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.790" end="00:27:14.650" style="s2">when Zoroaster invented EV ontology</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.510" end="00:27:30.350" style="s2">ideas okay because they&#39;re worse</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.610" end="00:27:31.430" style="s2">especially men need to do that men need</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.350" end="00:27:33.380" style="s2">to move the world of ideas because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.430" end="00:27:37.160" style="s2">they&#39;re settled that means you still you</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.380" end="00:27:38.630" style="s2">were out and about doing warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.160" end="00:27:41.480" style="s2">hunting and shit like that but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.630" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">always returning to the same point which</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.480" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">is the inner circle where the women of</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.950" end="00:27:53.090" style="s2">delivery station so we talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.500" end="00:27:55.430" style="s2">say yeah we talked about that you go to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.090" end="00:27:57.290" style="s2">water or you go hunting as a man to then</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.430" end="00:27:59.330" style="s2">go back to the delivered station and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.290" end="00:28:01.430" style="s2">improve you worth it right mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.330" end="00:28:02.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the matter key you go back to and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.430" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">the patrick is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.540" end="00:28:07.550" style="s2">organizational warfare and hunting okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.590" style="s2">outer circuit in a circuit so then a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.550" end="00:28:11.990" style="s2">circuit settled and because the inner</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.590" end="00:28:14.810" style="s2">circuit settled we settled as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.990" end="00:28:16.340" style="s2">mm-hmm so fat lazy woman sat down eight</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.810" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">thousand years ago in Babylon and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:22.460" style="s2">haven&#39;t moved ever since okay so then so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:24.200" style="s2">roster says we got to move in the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.460" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">of ideas and the way to over the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.200" end="00:28:29.420" style="s2">of ideas is to move along the time axis</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.330" end="00:28:32.630" style="s2">rather than in physical space so he</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.420" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">moves to focus away from physical space</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.630" end="00:28:36.560" style="s2">where plate on the other guys stayed all</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">along and dreamed about perfection and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.560" end="00:28:40.070" style="s2">moved us over to process philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:42.710" style="s2">process thinking in constant movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:44.210" style="s2">this is what Heraclitus is Zoroaster</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.710" end="00:28:46.340" style="s2">arackliffe desist that everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.210" end="00:28:48.380" style="s2">changes everything is in flux that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.340" end="00:28:50.220" style="s2">fundamental aspect the reality flux</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.380" end="00:28:52.500" style="s2">itself is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.220" end="00:28:56.010" style="s2">so that&#39;s what saw a success too bud he</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.500" end="00:28:58.289" style="s2">says along the time axis dramatic things</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.010" end="00:29:01.080" style="s2">can happen at certain points in time</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.289" end="00:29:03.059" style="s2">that we called events and these events</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.080" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">can change history forever</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.059" end="00:29:07.620" style="s2">now if Girard had gone all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:09.419" style="s2">to numerology and Zoroaster seventh</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.620" end="00:29:10.950" style="s2">ology which he never did he would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.419" end="00:29:13.620" style="s2">looked at Christ a bit differently</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:17.159" style="s2">because Christ is the ultimate event to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.620" end="00:29:20.580" style="s2">Christians yeah bad Jerrod would agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.159" end="00:29:23.159" style="s2">on major rod would see more than the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.580" end="00:29:25.380" style="s2">final scapegoat in Christ because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.159" end="00:29:28.500" style="s2">the fan scapegoat in a Christian fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.380" end="00:29:31.260" style="s2">juice beg to differ 2000 years of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.500" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">programs certainly proved that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.260" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that well the Jews would say</p>

<p begin="00:29:39.000" end="00:29:43.020" style="s2">with if the Christians say like Jerrod</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:44.340" style="s2">says that well the hope of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.020" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">was that by putting Christ on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.340" end="00:29:47.490" style="s2">we had the final scapegoat we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:49.530" style="s2">any more scapegoats and we can start</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.490" end="00:29:51.240" style="s2">controlling the lynch mobs and make</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.530" end="00:29:53.640" style="s2">people more civilized and that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.240" end="00:29:55.590" style="s2">religion is all about civilizing and</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.339" end="00:36:16.460" style="s2">English I&#39;m we&#39;ve got to find that out</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.660" end="00:36:18.589" style="s2">so we can involve the people who watch</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.460" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">this and say that you pay a lot he&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.589" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">in Swedish if you read Swedish okay this</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:24.470" style="s2">is the guy besides the body Pharaoh that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.420" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna murder in the new book right</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.470" end="00:36:28.849" style="s2">and they come through at the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.420" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">and they sit on the loo they sit in you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.849" end="00:36:31.730" style="s2">know out of the forest and they sit and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:33.079" style="s2">think they&#39;re so fucking wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.730" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">amazing cause the little mummies boys</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.079" end="00:36:36.529" style="s2">and they know the truth about everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.539" style="s2">and they&#39;re called things like Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.529" end="00:36:41.869" style="s2">they&#39;re all Gnostics and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.539" end="00:36:43.489" style="s2">problem I have because the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.869" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">Jews and especially sera states are so</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.489" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">aggressive against Gnosticism is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:49.609" style="s2">you gotta have a unified worldview where</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:52.190" style="s2">you separate the fellows and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.609" end="00:36:54.680" style="s2">separate the fellows in turn from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.190" end="00:36:58.309" style="s2">Marquis but that&#39;s how you unify the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.680" end="00:37:00.499" style="s2">three and thereby unify the tribe then</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.309" end="00:37:03.230" style="s2">you unify the nation and unify the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.499" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">Empire and the only ideas we have today</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.230" end="00:37:08.569" style="s2">that we can take from history on how we</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:10.849" style="s2">could possibly get along the only</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.569" end="00:37:13.400" style="s2">original ideas we have the only eventho</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.849" end="00:37:15.799" style="s2">logical ideas we have is the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:17.269" style="s2">innovation of the nation sponsored by</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.799" end="00:37:19.249" style="s2">the persons and it&#39;s the person</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.269" end="00:37:21.380" style="s2">innovation of the Empire and all other</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.249" end="00:37:23.210" style="s2">empires like the Chinese and the Indian</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.380" end="00:37:24.799" style="s2">empires and the Roman empires and today</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.210" end="00:37:26.900" style="s2">the American Empire whatever you like</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.799" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">are imitations of the original person</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.900" end="00:37:30.769" style="s2">Empire more or less successfully so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:32.180" style="s2">American Constitution is a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.769" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">sample or something that&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.180" end="00:37:36.710" style="s2">straight out of the Persian Empire it</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:38.509" style="s2">works wonderfully but the problem we</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.710" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">have is that we also have a nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.509" end="00:37:41.010" style="s2">that we should cherish and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:44.790" style="s2">Jewish one</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.010" end="00:37:46.650" style="s2">mm-hmm and I think the countries today</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.790" end="00:37:48.510" style="s2">that are doing fine like Japan are</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.650" end="00:37:52.470" style="s2">mimicking the same system Japan has</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.510" end="00:37:54.120" style="s2">Shintoism which is the religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.470" end="00:37:56.760" style="s2">military and the chieftains and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.120" end="00:37:58.260" style="s2">got buddhism which is the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.760" end="00:37:59.490" style="s2">what we would call the priestly class</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.260" end="00:38:01.530" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.490" end="00:38:02.850" style="s2">and those two religions opera in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.530" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">parallel you don&#39;t necessarily need</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.850" end="00:38:07.710" style="s2">religion for women in that case you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.770" end="00:38:09.630" style="s2">have one if you like in China they got</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.710" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">three so they probably turned Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.630" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">into something more magical</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:15.720" style="s2">they keep Taoism as the priests religion</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">and then they turn Confucianism into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.720" end="00:38:19.410" style="s2">organization of society which is always</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.580" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">where you find the chief chain the king</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.410" end="00:38:23.700" style="s2">you know those characters mm-hmm so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:26.570" style="s2">see that these systems are very stable</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.700" end="00:38:29.910" style="s2">over time mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.570" end="00:38:33.570" style="s2">but what we need today is to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.910" end="00:38:36.330" style="s2">the actual sources take back religion in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:38.220" style="s2">in China&#39;s case it means that the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.330" end="00:38:41.100" style="s2">out of the current predicament with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.220" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">Chinese communist dictatorship is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.100" end="00:38:46.230" style="s2">remove a thism from the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.910" style="s2">Constitution look at commis himself as</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.230" end="00:38:50.610" style="s2">one religion among many others which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.910" end="00:38:52.080" style="s2">perfect okay and then start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.610" end="00:38:54.630" style="s2">the possibility of a split phallus we</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.080" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">can find in Chinese culture and to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.630" end="00:38:58.290" style="s2">that is put Taoist and Confucianism</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">against each other and that would create</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.290" end="00:39:05.340" style="s2">a perfect political system at least two</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:06.930" style="s2">parties mmm yeah no that would be China</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.340" end="00:39:08.250" style="s2">learning from America ironically but</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.930" end="00:39:10.470" style="s2">it&#39;s actually learning from the Persian</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.250" end="00:39:12.030" style="s2">Empire in creating a system that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.470" end="00:39:13.800" style="s2">more stable over time to the current</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.030" end="00:39:17.790" style="s2">communist dictatorship because China is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.800" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">gonna run totally mock and arriving</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.790" end="00:39:21.960" style="s2">havoc it almost did with it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:23.970" style="s2">that was Chinese culture wasn&#39;t it for</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.960" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">for thousands of years yes the balance</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.970" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">of Taoism</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:31.560" style="s2">yes yes that&#39;s when he was stable so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:33.390" style="s2">will discover that any stable Empire</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.560" end="00:39:37.080" style="s2">over time including the United States</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.390" end="00:39:40.980" style="s2">today any stable and prototype has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.080" end="00:39:42.870" style="s2">structure that is a triad there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.980" end="00:39:45.930" style="s2">delivery station called the mare Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.870" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">that you deliver to that&#39;s all women</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.930" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">need they have that foundation which you</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:53.430" style="s2">come from where you turn return to when</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.930" style="s2">you die it&#39;s more suitable and it holds</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.430" end="00:39:56.280" style="s2">responsible for your actions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.930" end="00:39:57.960" style="s2">delivery station but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.280" end="00:39:59.819" style="s2">children are born and we&#39;re heritage is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.960" end="00:40:01.140" style="s2">created so your transcendental is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.819" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">completely dependent of the majority</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.140" end="00:40:05.309" style="s2">working the way a matriarchy works is</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:07.079" style="s2">that it then holds the two phallic</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.309" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">functions responsible for doing their</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.079" end="00:40:11.010" style="s2">shit and that means many to split up</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:13.650" style="s2">between the guys that have brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.010" end="00:40:15.059" style="s2">minds and we called them priests and her</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.650" end="00:40:15.630" style="s2">brilliant bodies and we call them</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.059" end="00:40:17.880" style="s2">chieftains</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.630" end="00:40:19.650" style="s2">and those are the guys we look up to his</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.880" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">men and they should admire each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.650" end="00:40:24.660" style="s2">but have separate courts and separate</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:26.569" style="s2">capitals and separate power systems and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.660" end="00:40:29.490" style="s2">do not interfere with one another</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.569" end="00:40:31.349" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s what the purse is discovered</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.490" end="00:40:33.930" style="s2">this is what&#39;s or established a spot</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.349" end="00:40:35.460" style="s2">discovered in Persia three thousand five</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.930" end="00:40:40.500" style="s2">separate should they be issues should</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.460" end="00:40:43.650" style="s2">they not you know ask separate as you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.500" end="00:40:45.059" style="s2">are when you admire another man for</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.650" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">having the strengths that are your</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.059" end="00:40:49.770" style="s2">weaknesses mmm but also allow him to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">admire you for having your strengths</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.770" end="00:40:54.690" style="s2">that are his weaknesses okay whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:57.720" style="s2">distance is required to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.690" end="00:41:03.270" style="s2">admiring relationship without going into</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.720" end="00:41:05.339" style="s2">rivalry is perfect because this is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.270" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">you want the cane on the Able&#39;s this you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.339" end="00:41:10.140" style="s2">want the more them the reason why I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">all these mythical stories and dudas I</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.140" end="00:41:13.470" style="s2">means arresting us I mean Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:15.420" style="s2">to stop everywhere about the rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.470" end="00:41:18.180" style="s2">brothers what we want the right void the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.420" end="00:41:19.890" style="s2">rivalry is because the rivalry if the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.180" end="00:41:21.869" style="s2">rivalry goes all the way up to the top</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.890" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">in drivers between the chief turn of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.869" end="00:41:26.250" style="s2">priests sooner or later one of them will</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">become the dictator and the tyrant hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.250" end="00:41:31.470" style="s2">and it will only rule for a short time</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:33.869" style="s2">so enormous havoc while he does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.470" end="00:41:35.579" style="s2">that&#39;s important and that&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.869" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.579" end="00:41:41.369" style="s2">dictators don&#39;t last but they caused</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:43.109" style="s2">enormous havoc when they do yeah well we</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.369" end="00:41:45.210" style="s2">all know how bad dictators are but what</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.109" end="00:41:46.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to do very well is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.210" end="00:41:48.690" style="s2">keep those two from becoming round yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.920" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">there are two ways to look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.690" end="00:41:51.329" style="s2">there was actually Peter Towson who I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">know I work with a love that he came up</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.329" end="00:41:54.510" style="s2">with this second one because you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:56.069" style="s2">I&#39;ll be working a lot with the Peter Pan</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.510" end="00:41:58.109" style="s2">syndrome because it&#39;s so dominant in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.069" end="00:42:00.150" style="s2">culture today it was a very American</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.109" end="00:42:01.980" style="s2">phenomenon so the Peter Pan syndrome is</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.490" end="00:43:16.830" style="s2">because we don&#39;t trust men any longer</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.390" end="00:43:34.920" style="s2">so the phallic power no longer exists</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.940" end="00:43:36.300" style="s2">and that means young men are trained to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.920" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">become Peter Pan syndrome whether they</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.550" end="00:44:25.940" style="s2">Peter Pan syndrome is like the neurosis</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.320" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">here but this should be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.940" end="00:44:31.010" style="s2">psychotic reaction to there should be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:33.860" style="s2">guy who was actually perfectly healthy</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.010" end="00:44:35.960" style="s2">mentally healthy but who grew up in an</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:10.760" style="s2">or something he&#39;s yes yes so he he must</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.160" end="00:46:12.590" style="s2">be considered absolutely sane but</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.760" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">because his own vault</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.650" end="00:46:34.910" style="s2">Aristotle constantly reminding Plato</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:36.290" style="s2">that everything is about context it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.910" end="00:46:38.570" style="s2">where the idea arrives</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.290" end="00:46:40.580" style="s2">makes you either crazy or sane and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.570" end="00:46:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a saying you have a sane idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.580" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">that arrives in a completely crazy</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.320" end="00:46:47.990" style="s2">environment mm-hmm you&#39;re gonna think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:50.180" style="s2">your sanity as insanity and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.990" end="00:46:51.380" style="s2">be Caligula so we can call it Caligula</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.180" end="00:46:53.210" style="s2">syndrome and we should develop it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.380" end="00:46:56.300" style="s2">further I encourage everybody to do so</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.210" end="00:46:59.720" style="s2">because we need to understand when men</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.870" end="00:48:00.050" style="s2">to do and it&#39;s gonna get really really</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.390" end="00:48:01.580" style="s2">messy mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.050" end="00:48:04.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the super ardian lesson learned</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.580" end="00:48:05.600" style="s2">from history you know you see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.610" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">pattern here that you&#39;re not developing</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.600" end="00:48:08.900" style="s2">together we talked a lot to linear</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">Rachel Anderson - she converted to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.900" end="00:48:12.200" style="s2">Judaism for the same reasons that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.750" style="s2">converted or asterism we&#39;re good friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.200" end="00:48:16.580" style="s2">these days we&#39;re both with you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.750" end="00:48:18.260" style="s2">of us you know when he when he orders</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.580" end="00:48:20.210" style="s2">Jesus Christ to be killed in a way we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.260" end="00:48:22.250" style="s2">understand why that happened we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.210" end="00:48:24.200" style="s2">like the Gnostics out there the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.250" end="00:48:27.410" style="s2">have caused havoc now for so long I</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.200" end="00:48:29.360" style="s2">would even say that you know I love and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.410" end="00:48:32.270" style="s2">respect Horkheimer and Adorno for their</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.360" end="00:48:35.540" style="s2">book the the dialect is of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.270" end="00:48:38.030" style="s2">right it&#39;s a book from the 1940s mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.540" end="00:48:40.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know yeah yeah so the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.030" end="00:48:42.320" style="s2">of enlightenment so the Enlightenment we</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.940" end="00:48:46.060" style="s2">should really rewrite that as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.320" end="00:48:46.060" style="s2">dialectics of the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.150" end="00:48:49.299" style="s2">even deeper than the European</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.500" end="00:48:50.770" style="s2">enlightenment the exhalation Europe was</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.299" end="00:48:53.170" style="s2">they did like that but the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.770" end="00:48:55.000" style="s2">itself when it happened across Eurasia</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.170" end="00:48:56.829" style="s2">from China the East all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.000" end="00:48:58.839" style="s2">Greece in the West mm-hmm when that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.829" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">happened and we got all of Greek</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.839" end="00:49:02.829" style="s2">philosophy and Greek drama out of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:05.289" style="s2">and we got you know Confucius we got</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.829" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">loud say we got the Buddha we got all</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.289" end="00:49:10.390" style="s2">those guys out of that period I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:12.849" style="s2">that whole period although for all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.390" end="00:49:15.069" style="s2">riches it created culturally when it</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.849" end="00:49:16.690" style="s2">comes to our ideas and how we must live</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.069" end="00:49:18.579" style="s2">today I think it&#39;s actually the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.690" end="00:49:20.770" style="s2">period to go to is where I differ we</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.579" end="00:49:22.660" style="s2">don&#39;t forget oh no well he&#39;s critical of</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.660" end="00:49:28.569" style="s2">I was critical of two world mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.430" end="00:49:30.309" style="s2">critical of the dualism er okay he calls</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.569" end="00:49:32.500" style="s2">it to world mythology says we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.309" end="00:49:34.869" style="s2">move out of two world mythology oh then</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.500" end="00:49:36.490" style="s2">why does why does he flirt so much with</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.869" end="00:49:39.069" style="s2">the Gnostics and with the neo-platonists</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.490" end="00:49:41.319" style="s2">I don&#39;t get that it&#39;s just like you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:50.799" style="s2">two worlds fantasy they don&#39;t live in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.700" end="00:49:52.660" style="s2">modest way that all because you live in</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.799" end="00:49:55.450" style="s2">a modest world like they the juice did</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.660" end="00:49:57.250" style="s2">and certainly this arrest is did you go</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.450" end="00:49:59.559" style="s2">after the Gnostics they&#39;re your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.250" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2">there is no way you can accept that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.559" end="00:50:02.349" style="s2">run around all over the place praying</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:05.500" style="s2">they do a list nonsense because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.349" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">the ultimate fake pharmacist the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.500" end="00:50:09.700" style="s2">authentic fanos tells you that the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:14.349" style="s2">is unified everything is interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.700" end="00:50:16.119" style="s2">and I am just the phallus coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.349" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">this world to provide order within the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.119" end="00:50:24.279" style="s2">chaos to unify the world mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:25.559" style="s2">not to split it to unify it hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.279" end="00:50:28.089" style="s2">why you and I are modest</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.559" end="00:50:29.619" style="s2">we believe that everything that exists</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.089" end="00:50:31.930" style="s2">is interconnected with everything else</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.619" end="00:50:35.020" style="s2">and affects everything else mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.930" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter for you and me if an</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.020" end="00:50:40.089" style="s2">idea that blows through your mind has an</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:41.829" style="s2">electrochemical hormonal version of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.089" end="00:50:43.150" style="s2">in the brain or not because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.829" end="00:50:45.730" style="s2">itself would then create the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.150" end="00:50:47.789" style="s2">electrochemical hormonal reaction anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.730" end="00:50:50.260" style="s2">it&#39;s an interactivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.789" end="00:50:52.660" style="s2">it&#39;s an interactivity between emergence</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.260" end="00:50:55.059" style="s2">vectors your mind interacts with your</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.660" end="00:50:57.250" style="s2">biology your biology interacts with your</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.059" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">chemistry your chemistry interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.250" end="00:50:59.770" style="s2">physics and physics even interacts with</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.770" end="00:51:04.030" style="s2">six so all these different emergence</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.260" end="00:51:05.650" style="s2">vectors are on a party one another the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.030" end="00:51:07.240" style="s2">equal and they interact with one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.650" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">and we live in a universe and all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.240" end="00:51:11.080" style="s2">difference emerges vectors these</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:13.540" style="s2">different spheres interact with one</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.080" end="00:51:17.110" style="s2">another the difference fears but in not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.540" end="00:51:19.240" style="s2">different worlds because they do affect</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.110" end="00:51:22.120" style="s2">one another the one world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.240" end="00:51:23.980" style="s2">what you are one body with one mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.120" end="00:51:27.160" style="s2">inside that body and the body in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.980" end="00:51:28.390" style="s2">mind are unified your mind is embodied</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.160" end="00:51:32.590" style="s2">until the day you die</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">hmm there is no there is no split</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.590" end="00:51:38.500" style="s2">between body and mind they cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:45.310" style="s2">separated sure what must be separated is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.500" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2">phallus but not you explain you must</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.310" end="00:51:51.310" style="s2">separate the leader of your mind from</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:54.040" style="s2">the leader of your body so the guy</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.310" end="00:51:57.130" style="s2">teaches leads you to optimize what your</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.040" end="00:51:59.350" style="s2">body can do which includes physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.130" end="00:52:01.320" style="s2">exercise and work and sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.350" end="00:52:03.610" style="s2">everything like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.320" end="00:52:06.910" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got to have a teacher who</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.610" end="00:52:08.650" style="s2">teaches you to optimize your mind the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.910" end="00:52:11.260" style="s2">two different guys you go to the priest</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.650" end="00:52:13.330" style="s2">of your mind optimized you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.260" end="00:52:15.700" style="s2">chief tenth of your body optimized so</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.330" end="00:52:17.350" style="s2">the two different father figures or role</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.700" end="00:52:19.270" style="s2">figures you look up to the two different</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.350" end="00:52:23.100" style="s2">phalluses that&#39;s how the phallus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.270" end="00:52:26.980" style="s2">split but you&#39;re not split it is only</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.100" end="00:52:29.470" style="s2">when we want to kill the priest of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.980" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">chief King and become priests and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.470" end="00:52:34.750" style="s2">chieftains prematurely and we aim for</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:36.850" style="s2">being one of them and then have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.750" end="00:52:37.960" style="s2">childish idea that if I want to be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.850" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">priest and I&#39;m the young priest the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.960" end="00:52:43.660" style="s2">priest is superior to the chief thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:45.790" style="s2">that you get agnostic mmm-hmm no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.660" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">what agnostic young man fantasizes about</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.790" end="00:52:50.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s why in the original trial we</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">just banged his head no woman woke up to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:53.950" style="s2">him and said don&#39;t you dare think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.120" style="s2">you as a young priest could ever live</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.950" end="00:52:57.400" style="s2">without the young chief that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.120" end="00:52:59.260" style="s2">nothing without it and by the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.400" end="00:53:03.880" style="s2">the guy gets to fuck at the next ritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.260" end="00:53:06.580" style="s2">you won&#39;t you can watch right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.880" end="00:53:09.270" style="s2">exactly what we must avoid dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.580" end="00:53:11.310" style="s2">and tyranny at all times</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.270" end="00:53:13.260" style="s2">and I&#39;m not moralizing ISM just say the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.310" end="00:53:15.750" style="s2">dysfunctional and credited violent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.260" end="00:53:18.360" style="s2">take us down and the way we avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.750" end="00:53:20.490" style="s2">when then when a nomad illogical tribe</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.360" end="00:53:22.260" style="s2">this also moves forward when society</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.490" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">moves forward into the future when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.260" end="00:53:25.619" style="s2">try to create a better world we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:28.560" style="s2">precisely because we separate the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.619" end="00:53:33.420" style="s2">leadership our mind from the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.560" end="00:53:35.580" style="s2">of body and as a men do the two</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.420" end="00:53:37.770" style="s2">different specialties and we then create</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.580" end="00:53:40.430" style="s2">the different archetypes because if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.770" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">know the two leaders Moses and Aaron</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.430" end="00:53:46.170" style="s2">Moses or establish the spot are</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:48.270" style="s2">separated maybe no there must be at</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.170" end="00:53:50.910" style="s2">least two archetypes here and I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.270" end="00:53:53.730" style="s2">be more than one of them so there must</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.910" end="00:53:55.890" style="s2">be things I&#39;m not very good at and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.730" end="00:53:59.220" style="s2">is to me the response to Gerard&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.890" end="00:54:02.700" style="s2">the way you avoid rivalries by teaching</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.220" end="00:54:05.220" style="s2">archetypes young men in teach them in</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.700" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">their own architects great yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.220" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">how I get out of your arts problem</p>

<p begin="01:00:48.500" end="01:00:53.780" style="s2">through history right it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.750" end="01:00:54.650" style="s2">emancipatory idea it is the idea though</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.780" end="01:00:56.330" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.650" end="01:00:59.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no emancipatory idea obviously</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.330" end="01:01:01.100" style="s2">in the original nomadic tribes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.300" end="01:01:04.130" style="s2">no no no there&#39;s just a necessary</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.130" end="01:01:07.820" style="s2">a little taoist here and use the end of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.900" end="01:01:11.720" style="s2">the young so if you go to the yin and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.820" end="01:01:13.610" style="s2">the female that&#39;s constantly the channel</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.720" end="01:01:15.380" style="s2">return of the same that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.610" end="01:01:17.570" style="s2">reincarnation it&#39;s a feminine idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.380" end="01:01:18.800" style="s2">that&#39;s why everything being reborn all</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.570" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">over again is feminine the other so</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.800" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">women remember birthdays much better</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:25.100" style="s2">than men do so the whole idea that every</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:28.070" style="s2">new year is literally a new world you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.100" end="01:01:30.170" style="s2">a new year meaning a new world yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.070" end="01:01:31.700" style="s2">at the end of the year that&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.170" end="01:01:33.770" style="s2">the world and the new year is a new</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.700" end="01:01:35.510" style="s2">world yeah that&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.770" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">matter logical religion that has strong</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.510" end="01:01:40.190" style="s2">new year&#39;s right so new years are not</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:43.430" style="s2">celebrated big time and Islam and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.190" end="01:01:45.140" style="s2">Christianity speaks volumes none but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.430" end="01:01:47.000" style="s2">it&#39;s celebrated in pagan religion is</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.140" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">celebrated any religion that cyclical</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.000" end="01:01:53.330" style="s2">and the rest of ism kept it as novels</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:56.930" style="s2">right so on top of that numerology</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.330" end="01:01:58.430" style="s2">because the daughter will only mimic the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.930" end="01:02:01.940" style="s2">mother to become like the mother and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.430" end="01:02:04.269" style="s2">that&#39;s fine mm-hmm the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.940" end="01:02:07.339" style="s2">ministers is feminine</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.269" end="01:02:10.549" style="s2">the mimesis with the exception is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.339" end="01:02:12.619" style="s2">masculine this is something it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.549" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">really like Girard makes it Lacan does</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.619" end="01:02:16.369" style="s2">it but it&#39;s actually great insight and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:17.750" style="s2">we got to put in the book mimesis with</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.369" end="01:02:19.700" style="s2">the exception the mimesis with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.750" end="01:02:21.200" style="s2">phallus is masculine</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.700" end="01:02:23.990" style="s2">de minimis is without the phallus which</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.200" end="01:02:26.089" style="s2">is the proper absolute mimesis is</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.990" end="01:02:27.859" style="s2">feminine so the daughter could just</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.089" end="01:02:28.970" style="s2">mimic the mother be exactly like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.859" end="01:02:30.440" style="s2">mother and everything would be fine</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.970" end="01:02:32.930" style="s2">because she would be birthing in</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.440" end="01:02:36.410" style="s2">children anyway when you last saw the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.930" end="01:02:41.750" style="s2">board yeah so okay but the son is</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.410" end="01:02:44.809" style="s2">slightly different than the father make</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.750" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">himself the numerology that is because</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.809" end="01:02:49.339" style="s2">in Amidala G gonna move into completely</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">unconquered territory you know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.339" end="01:02:53.210" style="s2">about you&#39;d be prepared to learn new</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:54.740" style="s2">things you will be able to forget them</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.210" end="01:02:57.079" style="s2">when you move into the next territory</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.740" end="01:02:59.289" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to prepare to learn new stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.079" end="01:03:03.890" style="s2">all the time that&#39;s a masculine trait</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.289" end="01:03:05.720" style="s2">mm-hmm okay that little impulse is</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.890" end="01:03:06.859" style="s2">something that give the laws talks about</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.720" end="01:03:08.180" style="s2">difference repetition because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.859" end="01:03:10.730" style="s2">focused on the phallic so he says that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.180" end="01:03:11.990" style="s2">but with every repetition every eternal</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.730" end="01:03:14.839" style="s2">return of the same that he talks about</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.990" end="01:03:16.490" style="s2">there&#39;s small deviation incremental but</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.839" end="01:03:18.349" style="s2">what the loss doesn&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.490" end="01:03:20.569" style="s2">that&#39;s only happening in the event of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.349" end="01:03:22.279" style="s2">logical volume they saw her astray and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.569" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">that means it&#39;s not in the normal</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.279" end="01:03:27.470" style="s2">illogical review it&#39;s not needed among</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.319" end="01:03:29.240" style="s2">women it&#39;s only needs among men so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.470" end="01:03:30.410" style="s2">that means is that if the Sun can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.240" end="01:03:33.160" style="s2">little different from the father you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.410" end="01:03:35.690" style="s2">even be a Tutankhamun like disaster</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.160" end="01:03:37.400" style="s2">worry could be an improvement of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.690" end="01:03:40.039" style="s2">father not because he&#39;s better the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.400" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">father but if he has access to more</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.039" end="01:03:43.369" style="s2">information than the father had in</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">communicate something better than the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.369" end="01:03:48.680" style="s2">father did right he can lineage flourish</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:50.359" style="s2">shaken so that idea could have existed</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.680" end="01:03:52.039" style="s2">for like a hundred thousand years but he</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.359" end="01:03:53.569" style="s2">could never be accomplished he can only</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.039" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">be dreamed like settling down could not</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.569" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">be accomplished you can only be dream</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:03:59.299" style="s2">about finding paradise one day and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:02.059" style="s2">having two sons down but with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.299" end="01:04:04.039" style="s2">arrival of written language mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.059" end="01:04:05.960" style="s2">this is the uniqueness of zoroastric</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.039" end="01:04:09.259" style="s2">with the written language it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.960" end="01:04:13.039" style="s2">perfectly possible for the son by</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.259" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">creating a logo stores information to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.039" end="01:04:16.759" style="s2">born and realized when he&#39;s 20 years old</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:17.540" style="s2">he has far more information available to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.759" end="01:04:20.060" style="s2">him than his father</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.540" end="01:04:22.100" style="s2">did and the priests aside that means to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.060" end="01:04:23.330" style="s2">be keep create a law and of the chief</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.100" end="01:04:26.120" style="s2">justice out of thinks it music come</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.330" end="01:04:28.420" style="s2">become become an engineer hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.120" end="01:04:31.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what the engineer and the lawyer</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.420" end="01:04:33.140" style="s2">only occur in history after it languages</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.160" end="01:04:35.540" style="s2">arrived and there a realization of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.140" end="01:04:38.570" style="s2">dream the son can create a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.540" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">better than the father I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.570" end="01:04:43.430" style="s2">anybody seen this pattern before but he</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:45.140" style="s2">makes absolute sense once you separate</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.430" end="01:04:47.330" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s eternal return of the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.140" end="01:04:49.100" style="s2">from his own desire for the ubermensch</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.330" end="01:04:50.180" style="s2">they say the human measure is possible</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.100" end="01:04:52.430" style="s2">because the Sun can create different</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.180" end="01:04:53.660" style="s2">world the father but that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.430" end="01:04:56.990" style="s2">story it&#39;s a different narrative</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.660" end="01:04:58.520" style="s2">ontology whereas everything everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.990" end="01:05:01.100" style="s2">returns to the same is that no matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.520" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">logical foundational narrative on which</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.100" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">you build society as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:06.890" style="s2">mm-hmm doctor well so we build a society</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:13.250" style="s2">or nammed ology but we build</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.890" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">civilization on earth ontology hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.250" end="01:05:16.580" style="s2">so this is why I was attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:18.950" style="s2">Nietzsche the loss because I sold the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.580" end="01:05:20.180" style="s2">phallic in them and I wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.950" end="01:05:21.890" style="s2">phallic philosopher because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.180" end="01:05:24.290" style="s2">weenie I&#39;m a Hegelian what we need today</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.890" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">is more if I like philosophy and we need</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.290" end="01:05:29.390" style="s2">them to honor and respect and understand</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:31.160" style="s2">circular and the no matter logical</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.390" end="01:05:32.870" style="s2">aspect aside so you&#39;re talking more</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.160" end="01:05:35.840" style="s2">about civilization in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.870" end="01:05:37.370" style="s2">than like for example the conversation I</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.840" end="01:05:39.350" style="s2">might have had with Nora Bateson or</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.370" end="01:05:41.590" style="s2">something or people like that or just</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.350" end="01:05:47.930" style="s2">talking about mostly talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.590" end="01:05:49.640" style="s2">society or not I&#39;d be interested if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.930" end="01:05:51.020" style="s2">want to share these ideas of America for</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.640" end="01:05:52.940" style="s2">example to see when he cut what do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.020" end="01:05:56.330" style="s2">response to that because maybe finally</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.940" end="01:05:57.740" style="s2">understands what I mean with criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.330" end="01:06:00.770" style="s2">him for seeing the phallus lacking in</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.740" end="01:06:02.030" style="s2">his philosophy if he&#39;s already skeptic</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.770" end="01:06:03.740" style="s2">about the Gnostics and it was already</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.030" end="01:06:05.000" style="s2">abetting that is immodest and if the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.740" end="01:06:07.460" style="s2">real good is inside of him which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.000" end="01:06:09.020" style="s2">modest steps forward then certain we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.460" end="01:06:10.940" style="s2">start having really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.020" end="01:06:13.730" style="s2">dialogues because I do think you and</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.940" end="01:06:15.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve always agreed that so a stillness</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.730" end="01:06:18.040" style="s2">and Buddhism operating parallel was the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.590" end="01:06:20.240" style="s2">best we&#39;ve ever seen of religion so far</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.040" end="01:06:21.620" style="s2">you another green another very your</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.879" end="01:17:33.169" style="s2">we can&#39;t do that consciously it just</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.739" end="01:17:33.920" style="s2">happens to us and when it happens to us</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.169" end="01:17:36.170" style="s2">is when we</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.920" end="01:17:40.010" style="s2">vente logically are forced into state of</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.170" end="01:17:42.050" style="s2">ecstasy or trauma hmm and the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.010" end="01:17:45.710" style="s2">you can do and you&#39;re right there is to</p>

<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:52.370" style="s2">else is either horrible or wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.270" end="01:17:54.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because you can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.370" end="01:17:57.560" style="s2">there you gotta go out and read the case</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.770" end="01:17:59.540" style="s2">and all you can do is memorize it and if</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.560" end="01:18:02.030" style="s2">you memorize the ecstasy it will always</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.540" end="01:18:03.020" style="s2">put a smile on your face you shared it</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.030" end="01:18:05.690" style="s2">with somebody you love the person</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.020" end="01:18:08.660" style="s2">forever and you know when you birth</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.660" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">know ecstatic experience could be sexual</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.780" end="01:18:14.360" style="s2">it could be psychedelic any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:15.500" style="s2">ecstatic explained having your life you</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.360" end="01:18:17.330" style="s2">will always remember it like a</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.500" end="01:18:18.110" style="s2">fundamental event your life to change</p>

<p begin="01:18:18.110" end="01:18:21.590" style="s2">and the same thing goes to trauma and</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.120" end="01:18:24.800" style="s2">the way to deal with trauma is basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.590" end="01:18:27.710" style="s2">to memorize it be thankful you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.800" end="01:18:28.850" style="s2">not there but I understand the fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.710" end="01:18:30.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve been there means you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.850" end="01:18:32.620" style="s2">understand somebody else&#39;s in traumatic</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.410" end="01:18:35.300" style="s2">State and you can empathize with them</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.620" end="01:18:37.820" style="s2">hmm yeah that&#39;s the lesson to learn from</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.300" end="01:18:38.540" style="s2">trauma yeah you have to learn from</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.820" end="01:18:40.310" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.540" end="01:18:41.750" style="s2">you know from suffering exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.310" end="01:18:43.190" style="s2">the way I see suffering there might be</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.750" end="01:18:44.570" style="s2">more to it you as a Buddhist might be</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.190" end="01:18:46.100" style="s2">able to teach me more I see tons of</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.570" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">suffering in the world today certainly a</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.100" end="01:18:52.550" style="s2">pandemic reminds you of it but I prefer</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.760" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">to put trauma and an ecstasy opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.550" end="01:18:56.120" style="s2">each other within their ontology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:18:58.370" style="s2">easy at least for me to handle that way</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.120" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s what so Russians do hmm and</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.370" end="01:19:03.290" style="s2">they just called an auto gird chef</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.290" end="01:19:08.450" style="s2">subject but suffering and conscious</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.140" end="01:19:12.110" style="s2">suffering so trauma is suffering that</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.450" end="01:19:15.470" style="s2">your your your not undergoing willingly</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.110" end="01:19:18.110" style="s2">or necessarily aware of what you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.470" end="01:19:19.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re shamanic yeah that&#39;s conscious</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.110" end="01:19:21.410" style="s2">suffering yeah that&#39;s what that if we</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.760" end="01:19:24.020" style="s2">call conscious that I would call trauma</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.410" end="01:19:25.580" style="s2">behind the bar absolute so you walk</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.020" end="01:19:28.130" style="s2">behind the bar absolute you ask how the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.580" end="01:19:30.110" style="s2">shaman&#39;s take you through ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.130" end="01:19:32.090" style="s2">that&#39;s incredibly painful and awful yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.110" end="01:19:33.380" style="s2">because you want to you want to know</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.090" end="01:19:35.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve been there and you won&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.380" end="01:19:36.830" style="s2">strength of having been there so then</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.060" end="01:19:38.750" style="s2">you&#39;re confronted as a shame with people</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.830" end="01:19:40.070" style="s2">who suffer you can say I cannot imagine</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.750" end="01:19:42.710" style="s2">what it&#39;s like New York not that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.070" end="01:19:44.390" style="s2">been in that place and the people then</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.710" end="01:19:45.230" style="s2">they would say thank you thank you thank</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.390" end="01:19:47.110" style="s2">you thank you because</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.230" end="01:19:49.900" style="s2">empathy starts with recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.110" end="01:19:52.300" style="s2">oh you&#39;ve been where I am thank God I</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.900" end="01:19:55.270" style="s2">can share this with somebody who gets it</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.300" end="01:19:57.070" style="s2">you know yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s why empathy</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.270" end="01:19:58.510" style="s2">comes out of that that&#39;s the best lesson</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.070" end="01:20:01.210" style="s2">learned and it&#39;s the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.510" end="01:20:02.950" style="s2">ecstasy and there&#39;s a very very rare</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.210" end="01:20:04.780" style="s2">case when these things are turned around</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.950" end="01:20:07.450" style="s2">when you can use of ontology that way</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.780" end="01:20:10.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s when you actually treat a drug</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.450" end="01:20:13.510" style="s2">addict who loves to be high mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.990" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">and he realizes that he can&#39;t fool the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.510" end="01:20:16.390" style="s2">world any longer he can&#39;t fool himself</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:19.060" style="s2">any longer</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.390" end="01:20:22.120" style="s2">and he must get out of that addiction to</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.060" end="01:20:24.430" style="s2">the high yeah and then to be shame and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.120" end="01:20:27.730" style="s2">said I&#39;ve been high - I&#39;ve taken myself</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.430" end="01:20:29.080" style="s2">to that stage of absolute bliss oh so</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.730" end="01:20:30.280" style="s2">you know how much I&#39;m gonna miss it</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.080" end="01:20:32.500" style="s2">I know how much you&#39;re gonna miss it you</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.280" end="01:20:34.570" style="s2">know what I can do without it you can do</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.500" end="01:20:36.910" style="s2">without it but I&#39;ve been there - that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.570" end="01:20:38.680" style="s2">when you switch that around and again</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.910" end="01:20:40.750" style="s2">because you can memorize the experience</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.680" end="01:20:43.150" style="s2">you can empathize that somebody who has</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.750" end="01:20:44.650" style="s2">to sacrifice it because the pro with</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.150" end="01:20:46.780" style="s2">ecstasy is that once you&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.650" end="01:20:50.920" style="s2">it you must learn not to try to go back</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.780" end="01:20:52.750" style="s2">there again mm-hmm because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.920" end="01:20:56.920" style="s2">become an addict mmm you become an</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.750" end="01:20:59.830" style="s2">addict and you ruin it yeah that makes</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.920" end="01:21:02.710" style="s2">sense so you can&#39;t use have ontology in</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.830" end="01:21:04.660" style="s2">both cases and you remember remember how</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.710" end="01:21:05.860" style="s2">radically you actually take people out</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.660" end="01:21:08.290" style="s2">of these states just because of it</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.860" end="01:21:10.090" style="s2">there&#39;s no way back that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.290" end="01:21:14.040" style="s2">ontology because it operates it along</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.090" end="01:21:17.110" style="s2">the time axis it&#39;s something there your</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.040" end="01:21:19.090" style="s2">time you know no you&#39;re this state this</p>
