<p begin="00:06:16.759" end="00:06:21.050" style="s2">now with these earlier times we never</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:23.659" style="s2">really have an excuse to be drinking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.050" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">the Q&amp;A but today if it were just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.659" end="00:06:27.620" style="s2">little bit later I&#39;d be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:29.030" style="s2">it join you there those passionfruit</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.620" end="00:06:32.030" style="s2">margaritas I made last night were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.030" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">good all right welcome back to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.030" end="00:06:37.969" style="s2">thirty first Q&amp;A livestream for the Dark</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.210" end="00:06:41.060" style="s2">Horse podcast we are going to now match</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.969" end="00:06:42.530" style="s2">our answers with your questions let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:44.120" style="s2">see how we do all right so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.530" end="00:06:48.919" style="s2">start with three that we didn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.120" end="00:06:51.500" style="s2">from last time this one is in reference</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.919" end="00:06:53.150" style="s2">to the black intellectual roundtable of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.500" end="00:06:54.860" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s chat it&#39;s curious that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.150" end="00:06:56.360" style="s2">religion was not mentioned which seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.860" end="00:06:58.699" style="s2">like it could be a major contributing</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.360" end="00:07:00.530" style="s2">factor no common moral framework or</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.699" end="00:07:03.319" style="s2">commonality in which we mostly operate</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.530" end="00:07:07.099" style="s2">under question mark each generation</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.319" end="00:07:08.449" style="s2">seems less so and even anti religion so</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.099" end="00:07:09.349" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of more of the comment than a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.449" end="00:07:11.690" style="s2">question but I thought it was worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.349" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">bringing up yep because it wasn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.690" end="00:07:16.789" style="s2">I mean no no one brought up religion I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">know at least I know John Wood jr. to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.789" end="00:07:20.659" style="s2">religious I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:22.430" style="s2">religious positions of everyone on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.659" end="00:07:28.340" style="s2">panel but I know there&#39;s at least some</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.430" end="00:07:30.110" style="s2">yeah yeah I would say this is a topic of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.340" end="00:07:32.990" style="s2">discussion in a lot of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:34.490" style="s2">circles and I think we are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.990" end="00:07:38.330" style="s2">to learn some sort of a new trick</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.490" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">there&#39;s what religion does traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:42.469" style="s2">and there&#39;s what religion is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.969" style="s2">and the what religion is thing has</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.469" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">become too complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.969" end="00:07:49.679" style="s2">and what religion does has been ignored</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:53.549" style="s2">because the is part has become</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.679" end="00:07:56.129" style="s2">incoherent so my suggestion would be we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.549" end="00:07:59.369" style="s2">need to figure out how to address the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.129" end="00:08:02.069" style="s2">needs that religion is targeted at</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.369" end="00:08:04.019" style="s2">evolutionarily in some new way because</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.069" end="00:08:06.509" style="s2">this is not a moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.019" end="00:08:10.799" style="s2">you know starting a religion doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.509" end="00:08:12.539" style="s2">make any sense taking any of the various</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.799" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">religions and trying to get everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.539" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">board that&#39;s not going to make sense so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:19.019" style="s2">in sum we need to have something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:23.519" style="s2">galvanizes us and causes us to have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.019" end="00:08:26.309" style="s2">expectation of of adhering to something</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.519" end="00:08:27.659" style="s2">larger than ourselves and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.309" end="00:08:30.649" style="s2">is something to be said for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.659" end="00:08:32.939" style="s2">that we have seen society become</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.649" end="00:08:35.639" style="s2">narcissistic and solipsistic in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.939" end="00:08:38.629" style="s2">absence of a belief structure that would</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.639" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">tend to frustrate those instincts indeed</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.629" end="00:08:43.560" style="s2">ok next question when arguing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.610" end="00:08:45.329" style="s2">behind black lives matter I often run</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.560" end="00:08:47.129" style="s2">into what I call the mr. burns syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.329" end="00:08:49.319" style="s2">where people say I sound like there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.129" end="00:08:51.509" style="s2">evil mastermind behind it though there</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.319" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t it still sounds conspiracy serious</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.509" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">thoughts yeah that&#39;s the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:09:02.339" style="s2">you know it&#39;s in part the big lie if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:06.209" style="s2">which is that because all that out what</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.339" end="00:09:10.829" style="s2">that is well the big lie involves that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.209" end="00:09:12.540" style="s2">if you tell a gigantic lie frequently</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.829" end="00:09:14.189" style="s2">and forcefully that people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.540" end="00:09:15.750" style="s2">assume there must be truth to it because</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.189" end="00:09:18.089" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine that you would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.750" end="00:09:19.860" style="s2">making up something so transparently</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.089" end="00:09:22.529" style="s2">false and did this originate with Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.860" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">did he just sort of publicize it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.529" end="00:09:27.899" style="s2">provide the world&#39;s most egregious</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:29.399" style="s2">example yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m hello because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.899" end="00:09:31.889" style="s2">believe there&#39;s some ambiguity about</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.399" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">that but it&#39;s certainly the context is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.889" end="00:09:39.329" style="s2">Hitlerian so I think we are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:40.949" style="s2">experiencing this which is as you speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.329" end="00:09:42.750" style="s2">about what&#39;s taking place you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.949" end="00:09:44.550" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of a horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.750" end="00:09:46.259" style="s2">revolution taking place in every</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.550" end="00:09:48.449" style="s2">institution that does sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.259" end="00:09:51.779" style="s2">conspiratorial and preposterous and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.449" end="00:09:54.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a temptation to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.779" end="00:09:58.190" style="s2">well normally that doesn&#39;t happen and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.899" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">whatever comes next will be you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.190" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">we&#39;ll die down it will fizzle out it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:05.319" style="s2">will this it will that when in fact some</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:07.430" style="s2">of us are saying no it won&#39;t because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.319" end="00:10:09.620" style="s2">amount of power that this thing has</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.430" end="00:10:11.180" style="s2">discovered it has is immense and it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.620" end="00:10:13.160" style="s2">not normal for something that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.180" end="00:10:15.259" style="s2">discovered that it is powerful to just</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.160" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">abandon that power so you know it will</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.259" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">change but we&#39;re headed somewhere very</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:22.279" style="s2">dangerous because of what we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.290" style="s2">discovered the process looks like and as</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.279" end="00:10:25.850" style="s2">you say that it does for somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.290" end="00:10:29.089" style="s2">not paying attention to the analytics it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.850" end="00:10:30.439" style="s2">does sound like you&#39;re being alarmist so</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.089" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">all I would say that alarmist is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.439" end="00:10:35.569" style="s2">different from hypothesizing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:36.949" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep dark force behind the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.569" end="00:10:38.449" style="s2">thing that&#39;s leading it right you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.949" end="00:10:40.129" style="s2">that that could be one way to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.449" end="00:10:42.589" style="s2">alarmist but it&#39;s not required by it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.129" end="00:10:46.339" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a misunderstanding it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.589" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">sort of a it&#39;s a it&#39;s the comic book a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.339" end="00:10:52.009" style="s2">vacation of our understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.899" style="s2">heroes and villains look like that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.009" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">idea that you can&#39;t have bad things</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.899" end="00:10:57.620" style="s2">happen in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">absent a villain behind the scenes that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.620" end="00:11:01.069" style="s2">are rubbing his hands together and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:03.259" style="s2">know making it all happen well you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.069" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">most most changes in history haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.259" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">happened that way but those that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:10.579" style="s2">certainly get a lot of play and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">horrifying and in part it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.579" end="00:11:15.290" style="s2">track them because they appeal to our</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">also evolutionary desire for narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.290" end="00:11:19.730" style="s2">so when you have a human being who you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:21.319" style="s2">can blame and you can track what they</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.730" end="00:11:22.639" style="s2">did and when they did it and what they</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.319" end="00:11:24.380" style="s2">why they said they did it whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.639" end="00:11:26.779" style="s2">you actually know why it&#39;s an easier</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.380" end="00:11:29.089" style="s2">story to tell yeah that&#39;s true so there</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.779" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">is something about the complete absence</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.089" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">of leadership in this movement that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:36.949" style="s2">means at some level we are all reduced</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:39.079" style="s2">to talking about a process yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.949" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">and talking about that process does you</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.079" end="00:11:44.329" style="s2">know it&#39;s much harder to navigate rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.660" end="00:11:46.009" style="s2">than being able to say well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.329" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">quote ya know and it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.009" end="00:11:50.420" style="s2">of why it&#39;s been relatively easy for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:51.980" style="s2">number of us now recently to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.420" end="00:11:53.420" style="s2">white fragility is the book that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.980" end="00:11:55.790" style="s2">held up that that was written by a woman</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.420" end="00:11:57.559" style="s2">and here&#39;s what&#39;s in the book and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.790" end="00:12:01.189" style="s2">nonsense and it&#39;s divisive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.559" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">dangerous but also you know the official</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.189" end="00:12:06.470" style="s2">website of black lives matter is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">official website without anyone&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:10.339" style="s2">on the masthead as far as I can tell but</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:11.540" style="s2">it itself is changing right like so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.339" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">know a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.540" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s ago I went to it and showed a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:18.290" style="s2">number of the you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2">pro-trans before pro-women sentiments</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.290" end="00:12:21.529" style="s2">and the anti-nuclear family sentiments</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.180" end="00:12:24.620" style="s2">and that thing has now been taken down</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.529" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">yep and before then before I before we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.620" end="00:12:29.180" style="s2">were doing these episodes there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">anti-israel sentiment which has long</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.180" end="00:12:33.850" style="s2">since been taken down and so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:36.709" style="s2">you know it&#39;s this moving target and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.850" end="00:12:40.100" style="s2">unless unless this is almost your</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.709" end="00:12:42.050" style="s2">full-time job to sort of figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:43.880" style="s2">it is that they&#39;re promoting and make</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.050" end="00:12:46.579" style="s2">sure that you keep you know the screen</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.880" end="00:12:49.940" style="s2">shot everything then there&#39;s cover</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.579" end="00:12:52.250" style="s2">they&#39;ve got cover by not having clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.940" end="00:12:54.319" style="s2">leaders because everyone is flawed every</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:12:56.149" style="s2">individual human being on the planet who</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.319" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">has ever lived who ever will live is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.149" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">flawed will have made errors at some</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:02.029" style="s2">point and therefore if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:04.370" style="s2">really really trying you can find</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.029" end="00:13:07.009" style="s2">something with which to disagree this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.370" end="00:13:10.459" style="s2">protects against that yeah no it does</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.009" end="00:13:13.819" style="s2">and it means that you you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.459" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">one read the elimination of the attack</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.819" end="00:13:18.620" style="s2">on the concept of the nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">being eliminated from the website did</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.620" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">they realize how insane that was or have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:27.380" style="s2">they just decided that that draws too</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:29.209" style="s2">much fire and so they&#39;ve disappeared it</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.380" end="00:13:31.430" style="s2">and do they still believe it which I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.209" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">certainly assume type then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.430" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">thing a leader you know you could you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">could ask them Frank Wright what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:41.060" style="s2">happened to that thing but as it is even</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:43.579" style="s2">now if you say to somebody look I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.060" end="00:13:44.899" style="s2">support the idea of black life black</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.579" end="00:13:47.510" style="s2">lives matter as we&#39;ve said many times</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.899" end="00:13:50.209" style="s2">black lives are undervalued black lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.510" end="00:13:51.319" style="s2">matter is a statement that outlines that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.209" end="00:13:53.329" style="s2">that we would support under normal</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.319" end="00:13:55.399" style="s2">circumstances however we can&#39;t support</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.329" end="00:13:56.839" style="s2">the movement because the movement is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.399" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">very closely associated with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.839" end="00:14:01.069" style="s2">organization it doesn&#39;t disavow the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2">organization and so the organization has</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.069" end="00:14:05.149" style="s2">a list of things on its website you send</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:06.620" style="s2">somebody you say look actually they</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.149" end="00:14:08.300" style="s2">they&#39;re against the nuclear family did</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.620" end="00:14:09.709" style="s2">you know that right and somebody goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.300" end="00:14:12.230" style="s2">and looks now and it&#39;s not there and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.709" end="00:14:14.029" style="s2">looks like you&#39;ve misunderstood right or</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.230" end="00:14:16.220" style="s2">you&#39;re you know you&#39;re going on hearsay</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.029" end="00:14:18.199" style="s2">when in fact it was right there well I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.220" end="00:14:19.880" style="s2">mean we we did show that on screen in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.199" end="00:14:21.740" style="s2">one of our episode I&#39;m glad we did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.880" end="00:14:24.110" style="s2">I&#39;m glad we did it captures it so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.740" end="00:14:26.030" style="s2">anybody who wonders whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.110" end="00:14:27.230" style="s2">some of us are imagining things we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.030" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">know that it was very definite or</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.230" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">engaging in hyperbole yep you know we</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:31.430" style="s2">can we can then say you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:33.830" style="s2">ask</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.430" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">has it been taken down because they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.830" end="00:14:38.420" style="s2">seen that that&#39;s not a tenable position</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.990" end="00:14:40.340" style="s2">nor is it consistent with the stated</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.420" end="00:14:42.080" style="s2">beliefs of the black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.340" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">movement or do they take it down because</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.080" end="00:14:48.710" style="s2">it makes it more difficult to continue</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.730" end="00:14:50.620" style="s2">to get recruits who are confused about</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.710" end="00:14:53.150" style="s2">what the organization actually is I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.620" end="00:14:55.880" style="s2">certainly suspect strongly that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.150" end="00:14:58.760" style="s2">second but that&#39;s that&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.880" end="00:15:00.770" style="s2">just interpretation on our part whereas</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.760" end="00:15:02.840" style="s2">is it up you know is there something on</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.770" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">the website or not you can point to it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.840" end="00:15:09.740" style="s2">and say yeah it&#39;s right there yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:10.730" style="s2">okay final question from episode 30 that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.740" end="00:15:14.090" style="s2">we wanted to get back to before</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.730" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">embarking on those from the last hour</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.090" end="00:15:18.020" style="s2">I just watched Benjamin voices full</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:20.150" style="s2">documentary of the Evergreen incident</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.020" end="00:15:21.889" style="s2">how did you survive there as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.150" end="00:15:24.889" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.889" end="00:15:28.470" style="s2">you want to take it off li you can start</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.889" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">just I thought it warranted a response</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.470" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">because we get we hit this a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:33.240" style="s2">the stuff I mean Benjamin was there too</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.790" style="s2">and Benjamin graduated and he learned a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.240" end="00:15:37.889" style="s2">tremendous amount and he also was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.790" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">subjected to some crazy stuff inside his</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.889" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">classrooms we didn&#39;t that that we he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:45.029" style="s2">subjected to some crazy stuff inside his</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:47.190" style="s2">classrooms some of which we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.029" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">actually have any idea about until the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">end because obviously in our classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.930" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">we weren&#39;t subjecting that kind of right</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:55.079" style="s2">yet so we weren&#39;t subjected to it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">the key thing to understand is how</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.079" end="00:16:00.360" style="s2">different the experience of an evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:02.819" style="s2">professor can be from a normal professor</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.360" end="00:16:05.459" style="s2">at some other college when your students</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.819" end="00:16:08.069" style="s2">are taking one class full-time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.459" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching one class full-time you</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.069" end="00:16:11.430" style="s2">have this high level of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:13.889" style="s2">that&#39;s involved in the college that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.430" end="00:16:17.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t connected to what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.889" end="00:16:19.620" style="s2">the wider College so we had actually an</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.670" end="00:16:21.509" style="s2">extraordinarily positive experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.620" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">because by and large we had excellent</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.509" end="00:16:26.189" style="s2">students our class&#39;s overflowed with</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">waiting list so we we had full rooms</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.189" end="00:16:29.370" style="s2">full of people who were excited to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:31.259" style="s2">professors who invested in them who</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.370" end="00:16:33.240" style="s2">cared about them individually because</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.259" end="00:16:34.889" style="s2">that&#39;s the experience they had in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:37.339" style="s2">classrooms they tended to bounce between</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.889" end="00:16:39.689" style="s2">my programs and your programs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.339" end="00:16:41.490" style="s2">sometimes when we taught jointly we</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.689" end="00:16:42.899" style="s2">would have even larger room full of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:46.649" style="s2">these people but basically the short</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.899" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">answer is we had a community of students</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.649" end="00:16:51.899" style="s2">that was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">and so our experience day to day was one</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.899" end="00:16:56.670" style="s2">that was invigorating and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:58.920" style="s2">simply fun and rewarding to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.670" end="00:17:01.589" style="s2">and interact and you know only when</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.920" end="00:17:04.350" style="s2">stuff bubbled up you know in faculty</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.589" end="00:17:06.059" style="s2">meetings or in other such contexts did</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.350" end="00:17:08.780" style="s2">you get the sense that something was</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.780" end="00:17:15.030" style="s2">it was light until Bridges showed up</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.059" end="00:17:16.919" style="s2">right there were little hints but by and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:19.860" style="s2">large people still talked about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.919" end="00:17:20.909" style="s2">that in order to teach you had to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.860" end="00:17:22.919" style="s2">people uncomfortable that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.909" end="00:17:25.350" style="s2">uncomfortableness was we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.919" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">happened a core value of the institution</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.350" end="00:17:28.919" style="s2">was teaching across significant</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:30.210" style="s2">differences which meant that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.919" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">have to look like the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.210" end="00:17:33.929" style="s2">seats in order to convey things to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:34.950" style="s2">and to learn from them you didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.929" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">to think like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.950" end="00:17:39.330" style="s2">people in the seats in order to convey</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:41.580" style="s2">things to them yeah look is easy and why</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.330" end="00:17:44.040" style="s2">are we stuck here but more important is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.580" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2">think it&#39;s thinking basically all of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.040" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">elements of being human there was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:48.540" style="s2">recognition that we were all going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">different and that that didn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t have an educational</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.170" style="s2">environment that functioned and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:57.030" style="s2">those things in fact there was there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.170" end="00:17:58.500" style="s2">not that much racial diversity at</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.030" end="00:18:02.190" style="s2">Evergreen I mean like the entire Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.500" end="00:18:04.650" style="s2">Northwest it was pretty white but there</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:06.660" style="s2">was an incredible socio-economic</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.660" end="00:18:10.110" style="s2">diversity and you know the number of</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.110" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">age was quite high in fact the average</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.610" end="00:18:16.290" style="s2">age of students at Evergreen was 24 25</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:18.180" style="s2">compared to 20 at most at most schools</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.290" end="00:18:20.610" style="s2">number of students were paying their own</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:52.170" style="s2">state of Washington and we used to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.310" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">because neither of us thought that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.170" end="00:18:55.890" style="s2">were going to become educators that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:58.740" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you know we were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.890" end="00:19:01.770" style="s2">ideas and generating and spreading ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.740" end="00:19:03.690" style="s2">but the idea of doing it primarily to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.770" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">and with undergraduates was never you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.690" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">know the thing that we thought that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:10.290" style="s2">were driven to do until we ended up at</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:13.560" style="s2">Evergreen and found this model that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.290" end="00:19:16.350" style="s2">allowed so much in so much engagement</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.560" end="00:19:19.140" style="s2">and really the back-and-forth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.350" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">playing with ideas and just you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.140" end="00:19:24.540" style="s2">learning from one another that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:27.150" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have wanted to be anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.540" end="00:19:29.820" style="s2">it would be very very hard and limiting</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.150" end="00:19:32.580" style="s2">and feel just impoverished to try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.820" end="00:19:34.710" style="s2">teach and a standard you know 50 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.580" end="00:19:38.040" style="s2">a week three times a week kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.710" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">situation again like that it just it</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.040" end="00:19:41.970" style="s2">just would not yeah wouldn&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:45.480" style="s2">create learning community well wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.970" end="00:19:48.560" style="s2">be satisfying as a job okay let us start</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.480" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">with questions from the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.560" end="00:19:52.680" style="s2">do you think do you think it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:19:54.420" style="s2">that the rise in perversion of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.680" end="00:19:55.980" style="s2">postplanner thought that is infecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.420" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">our major institutions and sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.980" end="00:20:00.840" style="s2">apparatus is part of a calculated plan</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">by outside forces to destabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.840" end="00:20:05.010" style="s2">u.s. from the inside out what it would</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:07.890" style="s2">be easier for a foreign power to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.010" end="00:20:10.650" style="s2">control in the midst of a civil war yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.890" end="00:20:13.820" style="s2">it would yeah I would say a number of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.650" end="00:20:17.220" style="s2">things are true we&#39;ve been watching this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.820" end="00:20:18.060" style="s2">school of thought gain power since the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.220" end="00:20:21.720" style="s2">90s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.060" end="00:20:27.330" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.720" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">this was seeded by a foreign power with</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.330" end="00:20:31.980" style="s2">intent that&#39;s it&#39;s too long a period of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:33.750" style="s2">time for it to have unfolded however it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.980" end="00:20:35.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean especially in our modern</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.750" end="00:20:38.120" style="s2">environment with algorithms and the like</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.970" end="00:20:41.460" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that somebody is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">taking opportunistic advantage of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.460" end="00:20:45.810" style="s2">conflict over these things and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:47.940" style="s2">amplifying certain sentiments because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.810" end="00:20:51.810" style="s2">is in their interest that we be devided</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.940" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">I mean the fact is divide-and-conquer is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.810" end="00:20:57.540" style="s2">well understood as a core strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:20:59.370" style="s2">winning this is dividing us very finely</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.540" end="00:21:04.620" style="s2">and in a way from which there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.370" end="00:21:06.360" style="s2">obvious recovery so it is almost certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.620" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">that our enemies will have noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:09.630" style="s2">and that they will be attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">amplify it to what degree that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.630" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">going on I don&#39;t know but I will say my</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">discussion with the DHS officer that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">talked about in the first hour one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:22.650" style="s2">the things he said several different</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:25.230" style="s2">times was that he believed we were being</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.650" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">played that we were being pushed towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.230" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">racial conflict and that that was not</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:33.420" style="s2">inherent to who we were that it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:34.950" style="s2">somehow being imposed I asked him who he</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.420" end="00:21:36.900" style="s2">thought was doing it he wasn&#39;t sure but</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.950" end="00:21:40.500" style="s2">he had the he had the sense that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.900" end="00:21:44.730" style="s2">what was going on one hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.500" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">implicit in this question might be that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.730" end="00:21:50.460" style="s2">the effectively postmodern takeover of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:53.430" style="s2">the Academy in the West and the u.s. in</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.460" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">particular could have been encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.430" end="00:21:58.200" style="s2">facilitated with resources from</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:22:00.420" style="s2">side and that&#39;s it that&#39;s a testable</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.200" end="00:22:01.770" style="s2">hypothesis the idea that the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.420" end="00:22:03.810" style="s2">these grievance Studies departments</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.770" end="00:22:06.660" style="s2">Gender Studies and African American</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.810" end="00:22:10.590" style="s2">Studies and Latin X studies and and all</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.660" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">of these things started I think it</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.590" end="00:22:13.290" style="s2">started in the 90s but it really took</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:17.810" style="s2">off sort of mid Otts</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.290" end="00:22:20.450" style="s2">through through now and those</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.810" end="00:22:23.310" style="s2">departments don&#39;t bring in any money and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.450" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">in general what we&#39;ve seen is a move</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.310" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">within universities a wave from you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">basically towards a business model in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">which you are you are valued as faculty</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:35.250" style="s2">and as a department on the basis of how</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:37.230" style="s2">much external funds you bring in since a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.250" end="00:22:39.000" style="s2">large fraction of those funds then goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.230" end="00:22:42.180" style="s2">to make the college run or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.000" end="00:22:45.660" style="s2">university run so how were those</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.180" end="00:22:47.460" style="s2">departments being paid for and I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.660" end="00:22:49.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know the answer to that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.460" end="00:22:51.150" style="s2">know how it was that so many such</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.590" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">departments got created and once they</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.150" end="00:22:55.170" style="s2">were there then you they were they had</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:57.150" style="s2">effectively already gamed the system</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.170" end="00:22:58.710" style="s2">because now when you count up</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.150" end="00:23:00.330" style="s2">departments and say oh we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.710" end="00:23:02.040" style="s2">a vote and see who wants to pass this</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.330" end="00:23:03.450" style="s2">measure across the entire campus well</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.040" end="00:23:06.120" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got you know twelve</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.450" end="00:23:09.750" style="s2">departments that are there but</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.120" end="00:23:11.610" style="s2">they already exist so I want to I I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.750" end="00:23:15.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know the answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.610" end="00:23:17.190" style="s2">but I do wonder if there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.180" end="00:23:19.770" style="s2">perverse incentive around creating those</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.190" end="00:23:22.110" style="s2">departments mmm that basically I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.770" end="00:23:23.580" style="s2">that&#39;s sorry but that&#39;s the high part</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.110" end="00:23:25.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have been assuming right</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.580" end="00:23:28.110" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s still what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.140" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">likely true but I actually occurs to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.110" end="00:23:31.800" style="s2">that I have no idea right</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:33.750" style="s2">the funding might be coming like where</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.800" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">did the funding come from given that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.750" end="00:23:37.560" style="s2">those departments cannot pay for</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:39.210" style="s2">themselves well I don&#39;t know that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.560" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">cannot pay for themselves in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.210" end="00:23:45.420" style="s2">that students it doesn&#39;t take very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:48.270" style="s2">if you have six departments that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.420" end="00:23:49.950" style="s2">basically are it&#39;s a pseudo replication</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.270" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">of the idea that all there is is power</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.950" end="00:23:54.840" style="s2">and that looks that way from the point</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">of view of women that looks that way</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.840" end="00:23:59.250" style="s2">from the point of view of this group</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:02.910" style="s2">that group one after the other it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.250" end="00:24:05.700" style="s2">the same point right the I don&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.910" end="00:24:09.030" style="s2">guess would be that the faculty in those</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.700" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">departments are not expensive the space</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.030" end="00:24:12.580" style="s2">to teach is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2">offensive and that basically to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.580" end="00:24:16.750" style="s2">extent that large numbers of students</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.530" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">think that they want to learn that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.750" end="00:24:19.300" style="s2">they want to learn when they get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:21.190" style="s2">college is about their own experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.300" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">you know close up with a microscope or</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.190" end="00:24:25.990" style="s2">something like that that basically this</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:28.270" style="s2">brings in tuition dollars gives people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">something that it isn&#39;t hard for them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.270" end="00:24:31.480" style="s2">get a degree in and so in a sense they</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:34.300" style="s2">will make the trade</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.480" end="00:24:36.160" style="s2">I could also I think I was disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.300" end="00:24:37.960" style="s2">with you up until that last point the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.160" end="00:24:39.970" style="s2">idea that these are effectively give me</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.960" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">degrees that if you if you get into some</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.970" end="00:24:45.429" style="s2">school and then you decide I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:47.410" style="s2">major in one of those things I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.429" end="00:24:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty hard to fill out yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.410" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">right so you know without any rocks and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.880" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">actually without each other either</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:25:01.570" style="s2">neither rocks nor jocks but what you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:03.010" style="s2">have are equally inexpensive to run by</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.570" end="00:25:05.980" style="s2">your rubric departments things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.010" end="00:25:07.540" style="s2">philosophy and literature that do</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.980" end="00:25:09.880" style="s2">actually have standards at least they</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.540" end="00:25:13.150" style="s2">used to and they still ought to because</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.880" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">we need the humanities those many</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.150" end="00:25:18.429" style="s2">schools are are getting rid of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.120" end="00:25:20.710" style="s2">departments they are slowly weaning you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.429" end="00:25:22.360" style="s2">know the the faculty way but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.710" end="00:25:23.559" style="s2">difference is that it&#39;s harder and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.360" end="00:25:25.390" style="s2">harder to attract students to those</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.559" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">departments because it&#39;s just as hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.390" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">make a living with a degree in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:33.900" style="s2">philosophy almost as it is to make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:36.370" style="s2">degree with a living in Chicano Studies</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.900" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually you&#39;re actually going</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.370" end="00:25:40.450" style="s2">to have to do some work to get a degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.750" end="00:25:41.710" style="s2">in philosophy and you know it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.450" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">be just as hard because philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.710" end="00:25:47.230" style="s2">real and you know we we we certainly we</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:49.150" style="s2">know some remarkable philosophers who I</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:52.059" style="s2">am quite sure when Christina Hoff</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.150" end="00:25:53.410" style="s2">Sommers was on on a faculty somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.059" end="00:25:55.000" style="s2">that she was actually educating people</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.410" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">and I believe that Peter Bogosian still</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.000" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">is when you know so long as he&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:01.710" style="s2">to buy PSU as just two philosophers that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:06.580" style="s2">come to the off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.710" end="00:26:08.500" style="s2">whereas I don&#39;t believe that students</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.580" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">emerge with much more than a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.500" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">their perennial victimhood from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:15.850" style="s2">grievant Studies Fields right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:18.220" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about you know fields</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.850" end="00:26:20.500" style="s2">that are inexpensive to run the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.220" end="00:26:23.230" style="s2">grievance Studies fields offer people I</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.500" end="00:26:23.740" style="s2">mean basically by saying right up front</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.230" end="00:26:26.170" style="s2">the only</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.740" end="00:26:27.730" style="s2">accounts is lived-experience you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.170" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">effectively declaring that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.730" end="00:26:31.059" style="s2">nothing to learn and therefore let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.600" style="s2">hear what you faced</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.059" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a gimme for</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.600" end="00:26:37.870" style="s2">students and for faculty too</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:39.850" style="s2">I mean this is this is what lazy faculty</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.870" end="00:26:42.730" style="s2">do they create a situation which they</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.850" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">have to do nothing and demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.730" end="00:26:45.309" style="s2">they know nothing which would be hard</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:48.610" style="s2">because in many cases they do know</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.309" end="00:26:49.900" style="s2">nothing and and and they&#39;re all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.610" end="00:26:53.370" style="s2">they get paid and the students get a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.900" end="00:26:56.380" style="s2">degree and it&#39;s a handshake in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.370" end="00:26:58.900" style="s2">something of value in the market but if</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.380" end="00:27:01.710" style="s2">no actual value in reality has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:05.350" style="s2">exchanged yep</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.710" end="00:27:07.380" style="s2">next question I&#39;m just jumping all over</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.350" end="00:27:09.640" style="s2">the place the pros suppressant Ovid</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.380" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">saves the lives of people who would have</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.640" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">died had they been infected before a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.320" end="00:27:15.580" style="s2">treatment became available when</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:17.470" style="s2">hospitals are not at risk of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.580" end="00:27:22.809" style="s2">overwhelmed by what mechanisms can</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.470" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">suppressing the spread save lives that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.809" end="00:27:26.290" style="s2">a curious question yeah there&#39;s an ax</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:27.400" style="s2">some there&#39;s an assumption in here that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.290" end="00:27:30.160" style="s2">I think isn&#39;t right but I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.400" end="00:27:34.150" style="s2">sure what the assumption is maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.160" end="00:27:40.330" style="s2">assumption is that the only benefit the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.150" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">only way that lives are saved by</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.330" end="00:27:43.090" style="s2">suppressing the spread is because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.860" end="00:27:44.980" style="s2">don&#39;t end up in hospitals which are</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.090" end="00:27:47.110" style="s2">overwhelmed and I I think I think I get</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.980" end="00:27:49.090" style="s2">it if this working this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.110" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">very early discussions of flatten the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.090" end="00:27:53.290" style="s2">curve and herd immunity notice you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:27:55.660" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard much about hurt at me and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.290" end="00:27:57.220" style="s2">ID lately because sophisticated people</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.660" end="00:28:00.070" style="s2">have largely given up on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.220" end="00:28:03.190" style="s2">this is the solution yeah so well and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.070" end="00:28:04.690" style="s2">and much of the world is flattening or</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.190" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">destroying the curve and we&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.690" end="00:28:09.130" style="s2">to try the second curve of even greater</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:11.559" style="s2">magnitude right which ultimately I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.130" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">the question is predicated on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.559" end="00:28:16.360" style="s2">that ultimately everybody gets it and if</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:19.240" style="s2">the hospital isn&#39;t isn&#39;t overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.360" end="00:28:21.160" style="s2">when you get there then when you get it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.240" end="00:28:22.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t dictate whether or not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.160" end="00:28:25.900" style="s2">gonna survive and there&#39;s some truth in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.900" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">that but what I would say is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.900" end="00:28:30.130" style="s2">imagine that a vaccine is possible we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:31.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know that it is not possible we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.130" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know that it is possible but it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.510" end="00:28:35.650" style="s2">plausible that a vaccine can exist that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:36.400" style="s2">it will take time to get to one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.650" end="00:28:38.200" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.400" end="00:28:40.690" style="s2">and from works we need to know that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.200" end="00:28:43.690" style="s2">is safe enough to administer and so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.690" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">might be two three four years out how it</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.690" end="00:28:48.130" style="s2">saves lives is what is the number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:50.290" style="s2">people that we can prevent from getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.130" end="00:28:51.820" style="s2">the disease through the date at which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.290" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">have some mechanism to prevent you from</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.820" end="00:28:58.360" style="s2">ever getting the disease so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">thing and and we know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.360" end="00:29:04.060" style="s2">there are morbidities that don&#39;t extend</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:06.130" style="s2">all the way to death right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.060" end="00:29:07.480" style="s2">exactly where it&#39;s going is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.130" end="00:29:10.300" style="s2">other thing is that we are under</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.480" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">counting the massive harms that people</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.300" end="00:29:15.220" style="s2">are experiencing even when they get it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.990" style="s2">and recover it&#39;s not everybody but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.220" end="00:29:19.000" style="s2">enough people and the harms are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.990" end="00:29:20.410" style="s2">substantial enough that we really need</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.000" end="00:29:22.180" style="s2">to be thinking carefully about this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.410" end="00:29:25.420" style="s2">then I would add one more thing to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.180" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">other countries have proven that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.420" end="00:29:29.290" style="s2">have some different kind of wherewithal</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">in order to deal with this some of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.290" end="00:29:33.210" style="s2">had easier puzzles to solve like New</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.590" style="s2">Zealand but nonetheless they solved it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.210" end="00:29:37.540" style="s2">what are those countries going to do if</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.590" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">one by one the countries of the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.540" end="00:29:41.770" style="s2">that have the wherewithal managed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">knock this thing out do you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.770" end="00:29:44.800" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna let us across the border</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.330" style="s2">no right we&#39;re gonna be able to travel</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.800" end="00:29:48.010" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re not allowed across the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.330" end="00:29:50.110" style="s2">border now almost anywhere as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.010" end="00:29:52.210" style="s2">mentioned one or two episodes ago and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.110" end="00:29:53.950" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna change if we continue</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.210" end="00:29:57.370" style="s2">doing this but I mean I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.950" end="00:29:59.140" style="s2">permanently if we don&#39;t beat this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.370" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">are we ever gonna be allowed to travel</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.140" end="00:30:03.040" style="s2">to New Zealand again probably not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:05.490" style="s2">would you if you were New Zealand would</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.040" end="00:30:07.330" style="s2">you allow if America had a problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.490" end="00:30:10.900" style="s2">continuing and basically this thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.330" end="00:30:12.790" style="s2">settled into a circulating cycle where</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.900" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">it was ever-present you wouldn&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.790" end="00:30:17.020" style="s2">this thing back in no rational country</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:18.820" style="s2">would and so this what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.020" end="00:30:20.470" style="s2">with respect to how the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.820" end="00:30:21.790" style="s2">world that screwed this up is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.470" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">allowed to interact with the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.790" end="00:30:26.260" style="s2">world that figured out how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:29.110" style="s2">it so at some level let&#39;s rip the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.260" end="00:30:30.790" style="s2">band-aid off let us actually confront</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.110" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">this the way it needs to be confronted</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.790" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">to stamp it out we do not want to wait</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.810" style="s2">for a vaccine we want to stamp it out</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">and it can be done it&#39;s harder now</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.810" end="00:30:43.240" style="s2">because having screwed that process up</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.380" style="s2">once we have quarantine fatigue or</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.240" end="00:30:46.600" style="s2">whatever you would call it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:48.730" style="s2">nonetheless it&#39;s only going to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.600" end="00:30:50.290" style="s2">harder and the costs to us are only</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.730" end="00:30:53.740" style="s2">going to get great area if you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.290" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">if we are the holdout amongst the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.740" end="00:30:59.050" style="s2">world that can&#39;t figure out how to stamp</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:01.420" style="s2">this out next question refers to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.050" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">something that has come up before and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.420" end="00:31:04.450" style="s2">still don&#39;t know exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:06.580" style="s2">celebrate it maybe you know it Brett</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.450" end="00:31:08.650" style="s2">what is your opinion on using a sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.580" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">ition to fill political positions</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.650" end="00:31:12.310" style="s2">instead of our current method would you</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:13.990" style="s2">like to see a successful unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.310" end="00:31:15.910" style="s2">start the conversation of moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.990" end="00:31:17.920" style="s2">sortition thanks for taking the time to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.910" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">do this show I don&#39;t know what sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.920" end="00:31:23.740" style="s2">ition is I don&#39;t know what sort it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">either let us say that sortition I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.740" end="00:31:28.300" style="s2">wondering if it has something perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:30.310" style="s2">do with rank-choice voting it&#39;s it that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.300" end="00:31:32.200" style="s2">would be my guess yes I don&#39;t know so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.310" end="00:31:34.840" style="s2">would say rank-choice voting is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.200" end="00:31:36.790" style="s2">high on the list of topics discussed</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.840" end="00:31:38.920" style="s2">inside the communities of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.790" end="00:31:41.890" style="s2">interested in fixing the way our</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.920" end="00:31:43.480" style="s2">political structure works so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.890" end="00:31:46.990" style="s2">know about sortition have to look into</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.480" end="00:31:48.730" style="s2">it but in terms of things that one can</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.990" end="00:31:54.990" style="s2">do within the constitutional structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.730" end="00:31:54.990" style="s2">we have there is a lot to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.140" end="00:32:02.410" style="s2">for reorganizing how we count votes for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.910" end="00:32:04.270" style="s2">example in primaries etc so anyway look</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.410" end="00:32:04.750" style="s2">for that you will hear more discussion</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.270" end="00:32:08.500" style="s2">soon</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.750" end="00:32:09.940" style="s2">I see confusion online about unity 2020s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.500" end="00:32:12.070" style="s2">goal of dealing with opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.940" end="00:32:14.680" style="s2">hoarding and rent-seeking as some view</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.070" end="00:32:15.970" style="s2">these as abstract assertions can you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.680" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">provide specific examples of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:20.260" style="s2">behaviors and practice and how the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:22.090" style="s2">current duopoly enables them so let me</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.260" end="00:32:24.100" style="s2">before you answer that&#39;s a big question</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.090" end="00:32:26.290" style="s2">and we&#39;re not going to spend you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.100" end="00:32:27.790" style="s2">that that could be a whole hour but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.290" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">also I don&#39;t know if it was in the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.790" end="00:32:32.830" style="s2">last time I also actually stopped you at</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.320" style="s2">one point and said let&#39;s just let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.830" end="00:32:36.730" style="s2">about rent-seeking is because some</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.320" end="00:32:38.620" style="s2">number of people are going to just think</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:39.880" style="s2">rent and think you know cancel rent</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.620" end="00:32:41.260" style="s2">which is one of the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.880" end="00:32:44.350" style="s2">abolish the bully defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.260" end="00:32:48.100" style="s2">cancel rent so that we have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.350" end="00:32:51.850" style="s2">that recently as well and in an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.100" end="00:32:55.180" style="s2">to to deal with the obvious problems of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.850" end="00:32:58.780" style="s2">always speaking in abstractions yep so</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.180" end="00:33:01.720" style="s2">let us talk a little bit about rent</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.780" end="00:33:03.520" style="s2">seeking as it exists and why Unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.720" end="00:33:03.650" style="s2">which does not have a platform nor does</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.520" end="00:33:06.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.650" end="00:33:10.100" style="s2">aim to have a platform would address it</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.760" end="00:33:13.580" style="s2">we have many instances in which we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.100" end="00:33:15.530" style="s2">a solvable problem that persistently</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.580" end="00:33:19.010" style="s2">remains unsolved</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.530" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">so our incredibly cruddy way of paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.010" end="00:33:25.250" style="s2">for and allocating the right to health</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:29.000" style="s2">care is a primary example why can we not</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.250" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">figure out a system in which your health</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.000" end="00:33:34.430" style="s2">conditions are dealt with as a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:36.770" style="s2">distributing the hazard over a risk pool</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.430" end="00:33:38.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not complex what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.770" end="00:33:41.720" style="s2">that is to be solved nor is it complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:45.860" style="s2">what the solution is the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.720" end="00:33:47.750" style="s2">we have a an industry in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.860" end="00:33:48.980" style="s2">something which markets cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:52.370" style="s2">allowed to do because they will</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.980" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">inevitably do it poorly so if you are in</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.370" end="00:33:57.680" style="s2">the insurance game and I don&#39;t mean if</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.500" end="00:33:59.300" style="s2">you are providing insurance which could</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.680" end="00:34:00.860" style="s2">be done well but if you are in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.300" end="00:34:03.080" style="s2">insurance game in the sense that you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:04.910" style="s2">an insurance company in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.080" end="00:34:07.250" style="s2">other insurance companies you will</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.910" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">inevitably discover that the way to win</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.250" end="00:34:10.909" style="s2">the insurance game is to insure the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:12.620" style="s2">people who are at least likely to need</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.909" end="00:34:14.630" style="s2">insurance and dissin sure the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.620" end="00:34:16.730" style="s2">are most likely to need the insurance so</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.630" end="00:34:19.850" style="s2">the job of insurance which is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.730" end="00:34:22.070" style="s2">neutralize the risks that we face when</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.850" end="00:34:25.159" style="s2">somebody has done nothing wrong and has</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.070" end="00:34:28.220" style="s2">gotten a cancer we can distribute the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.159" end="00:34:29.659" style="s2">cost of paying for the treatment of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.220" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">cancer across the entire population</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.659" end="00:34:34.580" style="s2">basically you don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">gonna get one or you&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.580" end="00:34:39.140" style="s2">one but we can all agree that I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:41.720" style="s2">like it not to be ruinous if I get</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.140" end="00:34:44.300" style="s2">cancer and so we can distribute the risk</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.720" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">across a large population but if my</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.300" end="00:34:48.169" style="s2">insurance company is in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:49.640" style="s2">profit-making business and it discovers</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.169" end="00:34:51.800" style="s2">well actually we&#39;d like to give the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.640" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">insurance in case you get a cancer to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.800" end="00:34:54.830" style="s2">people who are least likely to get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:56.510" style="s2">and we would like to dis insure the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.830" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">people who are most likely to get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.510" end="00:35:00.350" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way to enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">profits then what we end up doing is dis</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.350" end="00:35:04.670" style="s2">insuring lots of people who are equally</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:08.510" style="s2">deserving of being protected from this</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.670" end="00:35:11.210" style="s2">hazard so in essence the solution</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.510" end="00:35:14.600" style="s2">involves neutralizing the market forces</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.210" end="00:35:16.210" style="s2">that surround insurance now who do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.600" end="00:35:17.890" style="s2">think opposes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.210" end="00:35:19.630" style="s2">people who are making a profit and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.890" end="00:35:21.670" style="s2">insurance why can&#39;t we solve that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.630" end="00:35:23.859" style="s2">problem why do they have a vote well</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.670" end="00:35:27.190" style="s2">they have a vote because of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.859" end="00:35:29.109" style="s2">things like lobbying influence policy so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.190" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">persistently we are scratching our heads</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.109" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">and we have two parties that pretend</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">that there&#39;s some big disagreement on</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">how to make the system work right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:39.790" style="s2">gonna explain why they fail to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:41.260" style="s2">decade after decade when in fact they</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.150" end="00:36:54.580" style="s2">in particular you think probably PayPal</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.410" end="00:36:56.170" style="s2">um probably pay pause that right mmm I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.580" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know what percentage</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.170" end="00:36:59.589" style="s2">PayPal takes it depends patreon doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">take very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.589" end="00:37:06.359" style="s2">well PayPal doesn&#39;t charge anything if</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:08.650" style="s2">the payment is goods and is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.359" end="00:37:10.060" style="s2">friends-and-family rather than goods and</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.010" end="00:37:24.250" style="s2">comes from the fact that you paid them</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.069" end="00:37:41.650" style="s2">than YouTube YouTube takes 30 35 and 40</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.440" end="00:37:43.059" style="s2">percent which is remarkable and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.650" end="00:37:46.300" style="s2">been noted here before and we are</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.270" end="00:37:56.319" style="s2">to super chat so people can ask</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.020" end="00:38:02.920" style="s2">are generously donating to us yep I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.210" end="00:38:04.510" style="s2">would point out that YouTube is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.920" end="00:38:06.040" style="s2">perfect example of this rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.510" end="00:38:08.050" style="s2">issue and it you know it has the full</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.040" end="00:38:10.450" style="s2">complexity because YouTube is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.050" end="00:38:12.369" style="s2">providing a real service you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.450" end="00:38:14.190" style="s2">massive server firms that make all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.369" end="00:38:16.390" style="s2">this possible allow you to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.190" end="00:38:18.369" style="s2">videos anywhere in the world at high</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.390" end="00:38:20.349" style="s2">quality yada yada yada but the family</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.369" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">don&#39;t even have you know a price list</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.349" end="00:38:24.069" style="s2">anywhere like no one actually knows</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:25.450" style="s2">exactly on any given video or any</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.069" end="00:38:27.339" style="s2">different question exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.450" end="00:38:30.430" style="s2">percentage they&#39;re going to take is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.339" end="00:38:31.690" style="s2">pretty low it&#39;s it&#39;s all opaque and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.430" end="00:38:34.260" style="s2">know to the extent that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.690" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">appeal it&#39;s like you click appeal and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.260" end="00:38:38.530" style="s2">it&#39;s either granted or it isn&#39;t by some</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:41.140" style="s2">you know judge in the sky or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.530" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">but yeah but the point is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.140" end="00:38:45.130" style="s2">known some fraction of what YouTube does</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:46.630" style="s2">is providing a service and it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.130" end="00:38:48.520" style="s2">cut and that&#39;s fair and then some</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">fraction of what it takes is pure</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.520" end="00:38:54.130" style="s2">rent-seeking and you know I don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:55.960" style="s2">interesting to know what those two</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.130" end="00:39:02.230" style="s2">numbers what those two percentages were</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.960" end="00:39:04.109" style="s2">but a rest could have been done by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.230" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">police and did not require terror laws</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.109" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">agents were marked with police and DHS</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:11.710" style="s2">badges the cops used unmarked the cops</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.420" style="s2">use unmarked cars the tactic seems valid</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.710" end="00:39:14.680" style="s2">at the escalation I understand the fear</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.420" end="00:39:17.230" style="s2">for abuse but do you think it has</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.680" end="00:39:20.410" style="s2">actually happened so this with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.230" end="00:39:24.190" style="s2">the discussion last hour about NDAA yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.410" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">oh well NDAA but more specifically Trump</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.190" end="00:39:30.660" style="s2">declaring a Tifa terrorist so I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:33.339" style="s2">believe that there are abuses happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.660" end="00:39:36.460" style="s2">clearly according to a standard</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.339" end="00:39:38.890" style="s2">constitutional view because at the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.460" end="00:39:41.109" style="s2">that the police take you off the street</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.890" end="00:39:43.210" style="s2">they read you your rights then you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.109" end="00:39:45.160" style="s2">under arrest at that moment and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.210" end="00:39:46.809" style="s2">taking you I can&#39;t say that police do</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.160" end="00:39:49.450" style="s2">not take people into unmarked cars I</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.809" end="00:39:51.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about it but for one</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.450" end="00:39:54.790" style="s2">thing there is going to typically be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.670" end="00:39:57.010" style="s2">way to verify that a car is a police</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.790" end="00:39:59.619" style="s2">vehicle if these are rented vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.010" end="00:40:02.440" style="s2">right how do you know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.619" end="00:40:03.970" style="s2">between somebody kidnapping you or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.440" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">government kidnapping you because</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.970" end="00:40:07.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve got their fingers crossed behind</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:10.329" style="s2">their backs to you know obviate the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.960" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">utility of the Constitution because oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.329" end="00:40:14.440" style="s2">yeah Barack Obama signed the NDAA 2012</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.450" style="s2">and you should read it really carefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.440" end="00:40:19.150" style="s2">and consult the ACLU as to what it means</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.450" end="00:40:21.579" style="s2">and you know yeah so anyway yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.150" end="00:40:24.130" style="s2">think abuses are happening again I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.579" end="00:40:27.130" style="s2">say I believe the meaning of it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.130" end="00:40:30.760" style="s2">likely to be that they are signaling you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.130" end="00:40:33.790" style="s2">have triggered that mechanism right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.760" end="00:40:35.890" style="s2">why would they take people put them in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.790" end="00:40:38.109" style="s2">the Federal Building and then release</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.890" end="00:40:40.359" style="s2">them right there&#39;s something yes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.109" end="00:40:42.579" style="s2">engaged in abuses but there is something</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.359" end="00:40:45.010" style="s2">symbolic about the abuses they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.579" end="00:40:46.990" style="s2">engaged and they are alerting people you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.010" end="00:40:48.970" style="s2">triggered those provisions therefore</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.990" end="00:40:51.960" style="s2">frankly anything could happen to you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.970" end="00:40:54.099" style="s2">this is again exactly why I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.960" end="00:40:56.230" style="s2">terrorism invoked in this context</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.099" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">because now we are in this murky gray</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.230" end="00:41:03.010" style="s2">area that many of us have been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:05.230" style="s2">call attention to for well since 2012 so</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.010" end="00:41:06.970" style="s2">next question is similar the feds don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.230" end="00:41:08.829" style="s2">appear to seek to shut down the Portland</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.970" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">riots if they did they could have</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.829" end="00:41:13.240" style="s2">arrested and incarcerated without bail</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:17.500" style="s2">10 per night 500 rioters would now be</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.240" end="00:41:21.660" style="s2">off the battlefield your thoughts there</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.500" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">is no question that mayor wheeler is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.660" end="00:41:26.349" style="s2">hamstringing the Portland police and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.930" style="s2">that he is doing so this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.349" end="00:41:30.490" style="s2">feds in particular right it was feds</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:32.130" style="s2">don&#39;t appear to seek to shut down port</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.490" end="00:41:35.079" style="s2">riots</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.130" end="00:41:37.059" style="s2">well okay so there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.079" end="00:41:38.559" style="s2">what the feds would be doing I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.059" end="00:41:41.260" style="s2">not sure that the feds is being used</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.559" end="00:41:43.690" style="s2">specifically here because the feds the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.260" end="00:41:45.190" style="s2">reason that the feds are involved has to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.690" end="00:41:46.839" style="s2">do with these federal buildings which</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.190" end="00:41:50.710" style="s2">are inherently protected by federal</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:52.540" style="s2">officers now feds could be brought in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.710" end="00:41:54.420" style="s2">under other circumstances and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.540" end="00:41:56.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.420" end="00:41:59.109" style="s2">protections in all but it would have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.890" end="00:42:04.210" style="s2">be the Portland police or the State</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.109" end="00:42:06.609" style="s2">Police who were doing the arresting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.210" end="00:42:08.619" style="s2">there is resistance there is local</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.609" end="00:42:14.279" style="s2">political resistance to doing any such</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.619" end="00:42:17.799" style="s2">thing because Portland is so heavily</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.279" end="00:42:21.069" style="s2">Democratic and there is a basically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.799" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">virtually signaling by our our city and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.069" end="00:42:24.700" style="s2">state government and that is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:28.559" style="s2">that the federal government is on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.700" end="00:42:28.559" style="s2">front lines that was the dog</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.740" end="00:42:35.289" style="s2">so anyway really the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.470" end="00:42:37.720" style="s2">happen is for the the city and state</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.289" end="00:42:40.589" style="s2">agencies to do their job and to protect</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.720" end="00:42:42.940" style="s2">Portland from what has become a nightly</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.589" end="00:42:45.099" style="s2">violent riot but the political will to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.940" end="00:42:47.829" style="s2">do it isn&#39;t there which is I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.099" end="00:42:51.099" style="s2">this is frankly this is a Miss read by</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.829" end="00:42:53.529" style="s2">the politicians currently in power they</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.099" end="00:42:57.579" style="s2">they think that they are dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.529" end="00:43:01.630" style="s2">these Yahoo&#39;s for their reelection and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.579" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">mean they must else else the destruction</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.630" end="00:43:07.450" style="s2">this is going to cost so much money and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:10.450" style="s2">time and an already economically</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.450" end="00:43:11.619" style="s2">devastated City because every city is I</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.450" end="00:43:13.990" style="s2">kind of like a devastated because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.619" end="00:43:17.799" style="s2">Cove in nineteen and just just</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.990" end="00:43:20.049" style="s2">anecdotally I will say that when I go</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.799" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">out and have to ship something the UPS</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.049" end="00:43:26.049" style="s2">or you know it if you PS or the post</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:28.059" style="s2">office or just whenever I have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.049" end="00:43:30.130" style="s2">interchange with someone that is brief</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.059" end="00:43:31.750" style="s2">and no one&#39;s waiting behind me for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.130" end="00:43:36.339" style="s2">interchange to end as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.750" end="00:43:38.109" style="s2">possible I am finding ways to ask how</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.339" end="00:43:41.349" style="s2">are you doing what do you think what do</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.109" end="00:43:43.809" style="s2">you think of what&#39;s going on and so far</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.349" end="00:43:46.109" style="s2">to a person in which I am trying to not</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.809" end="00:43:49.480" style="s2">betray anything about what I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.109" end="00:43:53.109" style="s2">everyone whom I have spoken to across a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.480" end="00:43:56.410" style="s2">wide variety of demographics has said I</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.109" end="00:44:00.130" style="s2">think there was reason to wish that our</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:44:01.269" style="s2">policing was better and what has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.130" end="00:44:04.119" style="s2">allowed to happen in the streets of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.269" end="00:44:05.589" style="s2">Portland is a travesty and it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.119" end="00:44:07.480" style="s2">stop and I wonder where the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.589" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.480" end="00:44:11.890" style="s2">I agree that that&#39;s where people would</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:14.170" style="s2">likely be but the problem is the nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.890" end="00:44:17.170" style="s2">of the movement is such that it puts</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.170" end="00:44:22.630" style="s2">pressure on anybody who lets people vote</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.170" end="00:44:23.980" style="s2">in private they do but so a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.630" end="00:44:26.290" style="s2">think that this works like that where</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.980" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">people are going to say things publicly</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.290" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">and then privately feel very differently</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:31.510" style="s2">and we that will be registered in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">vote because what&#39;s happening is people</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.510" end="00:44:38.020" style="s2">are being placed in a position where</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:40.329" style="s2">they have to agree to these these false</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.020" end="00:44:42.280" style="s2">syllogisms and then having agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.329" end="00:44:43.450" style="s2">them out of fear they then convince</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.280" end="00:44:49.410" style="s2">themselves that that&#39;s what they believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.450" end="00:44:51.609" style="s2">and so right or wrong mayor wheeler is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.410" end="00:44:54.849" style="s2">understanding the threat not to come</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.609" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">from the rioters but to come from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.849" end="00:44:59.319" style="s2">people who with to signal that they also</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:01.059" style="s2">believe that black lives matter which of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.319" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">course is complex for all of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.059" end="00:45:04.420" style="s2">that we have said every time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:08.020" style="s2">discussed it right lots of people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.420" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">signaling that and you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.020" end="00:45:12.549" style="s2">creating a power vacuum that the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:16.510" style="s2">feds are now going to take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.549" end="00:45:17.890" style="s2">and you know basically we the citizens</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.510" end="00:45:19.900" style="s2">of Portland have been left in a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.890" end="00:45:21.670" style="s2">vulnerable position by that dynamic I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.900" end="00:45:23.559" style="s2">guess I&#39;m just saying that I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.670" end="00:45:26.770" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.559" end="00:45:28.839" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t who don&#39;t have their</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.770" end="00:45:32.380" style="s2">feet being held to the fire by this by</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.839" end="00:45:36.630" style="s2">the by the ideology inherent and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.380" end="00:45:39.339" style="s2">the rioters are doing and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.630" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">frankly I think this is this is split</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.339" end="00:45:44.710" style="s2">along pretty cleanly along class lines</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">and not at all perfectly but I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.710" end="00:45:49.660" style="s2">most working-class people are watching</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:51.670" style="s2">this saying what the actual hell like I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.660" end="00:45:54.130" style="s2">need to make a living I need I need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.670" end="00:45:56.680" style="s2">have a job I need to have a downtown of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.130" end="00:45:58.630" style="s2">which I can I can walk and be and have</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.680" end="00:46:01.809" style="s2">public transit that functions and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.630" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">is none of that and what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.809" end="00:46:08.799" style="s2">with leadership and it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">the look of these protests look it looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.799" end="00:46:14.859" style="s2">just like it did on campuses its these</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">privileged kids who don&#39;t have meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.859" end="00:46:18.280" style="s2">in their lives and yes it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:19.450" style="s2">like they&#39;re going to be able to make as</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.280" end="00:46:22.030" style="s2">good a go of it as there</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.450" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">it&#39;s had and that is a tragedy and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">need to address that and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:30.040" style="s2">occupy was about but this this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:33.400" style="s2">mostly poor people or black people on</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">the streets protesting yeah on the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.400" end="00:46:41.590" style="s2">hand you can see in the little episode</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:43.750" style="s2">with with the majority report that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.590" end="00:46:45.490" style="s2">know you and I have attempted to which</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.750" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">is which is a privileged white</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.490" end="00:46:48.850" style="s2">organization I&#39;m sure right this is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:49.450" style="s2">an upper-middle class this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.850" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.450" end="00:46:55.540" style="s2">well whatever it may be yeah you can see</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:46:57.130" style="s2">that what we have tried to do is we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.540" end="00:46:58.870" style="s2">tried to understand the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.130" end="00:47:01.420" style="s2">the situation and the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.870" end="00:47:04.090" style="s2">situation is you do have violent rioters</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.420" end="00:47:07.570" style="s2">in the streets nightly for some 50</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.090" end="00:47:09.490" style="s2">nights in a row yeah there is a reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.570" end="00:47:11.230" style="s2">that the protests are out there it has</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.490" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">to do with dysfunction in our system</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.230" end="00:47:16.540" style="s2">that&#39;s real you have abuses by federal</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.350" end="00:47:19.330" style="s2">powers you have a failure of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.540" end="00:47:20.950" style="s2">at the local level so we have not carved</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.330" end="00:47:24.670" style="s2">out a position on either side what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.950" end="00:47:28.090" style="s2">now happening to us what we have is a an</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.670" end="00:47:31.330" style="s2">Internet program that is now painting a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.090" end="00:47:34.210" style="s2">target on us that paints us as part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.330" end="00:47:36.220" style="s2">the federal abuses right in a case where</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.210" end="00:47:38.770" style="s2">we already have violence so they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.220" end="00:47:44.320" style="s2">putting our family in actual danger</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.770" end="00:47:46.180" style="s2">which means were we timid we would avoid</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.320" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">this topic so as not to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.180" end="00:47:50.680" style="s2">danger right and others will detect that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.390" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to take these positions</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.680" end="00:47:54.610" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want to be in danger</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.390" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">so the point is the room to have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.610" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">sort of nuanced position here is being</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:03.700" style="s2">dried up by threats that are being</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">delivered in public okay you know I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.700" end="00:48:06.970" style="s2">agree with you the sentiment would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:08.410" style="s2">there but I think people are also</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.970" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">detecting that there will be nobody</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.410" end="00:48:14.980" style="s2">there to support them if they attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.990" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">take up a nuanced position like yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.980" end="00:48:20.260" style="s2">troubled by the undervaluing of black</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:22.360" style="s2">lives but these riots have to stop well</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.260" end="00:48:24.820" style="s2">I guess I mean we need me to move on but</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:27.700" style="s2">I I guess I&#39;m saying no it does exist</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.820" end="00:48:29.320" style="s2">well I believe that a lot of people do</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.700" end="00:48:31.090" style="s2">actually have this position and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.320" end="00:48:32.590" style="s2">aren&#39;t people doing this they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.090" end="00:48:33.050" style="s2">people with voice there&#39;s no way to find</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.590" end="00:48:34.760" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.050" end="00:48:35.960" style="s2">you happen to walk into a store where</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.760" end="00:48:37.820" style="s2">they&#39;re working I mean he&#39;s these are</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.960" end="00:48:39.650" style="s2">retail clerks I&#39;m talking about really</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.820" end="00:48:42.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a it&#39;s a weird totally</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.650" end="00:48:45.560" style="s2">scattershot haphazard non you know non</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.410" end="00:50:12.220" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do two more here and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.460" end="00:50:16.130" style="s2">we&#39;ll move on to the next live stream</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:32.630" style="s2">choice which stymies both their plans</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.500" end="00:50:34.760" style="s2">and puts the Oval Office out of reach of</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.040" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">old corrupt establishment will hate this</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:45.290" style="s2">plan for sure and if we don&#39;t defeat</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">them their corruption will endure the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.290" end="00:50:48.809" style="s2">Articles of unity maybe our best</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:51.990" style="s2">out and choosing the best way is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.809" end="00:50:54.089" style="s2">elections are about that from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.990" end="00:50:55.529" style="s2">militant moderate hell yeah I love it</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.089" end="00:50:57.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a beautiful that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.529" end="00:51:01.170" style="s2">poetry that&#39;s really good I&#39;m glad I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.420" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t mess it up yeah it&#39;s good Huff to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.170" end="00:51:05.190" style="s2">write poetry that somebody can read on</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:07.710" style="s2">first reading and get the cadences and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.190" end="00:51:11.730" style="s2">everything right I did see it</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.710" end="00:51:14.099" style="s2">during our break but but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.730" end="00:51:16.529" style="s2">good good stuff thank you well done all</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.099" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">right two more questions here and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.529" end="00:51:21.059" style="s2">we&#39;ll switch sorry to not get to so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">of the so many of the twenty thirty</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.059" end="00:51:25.799" style="s2">dollar questions really enjoyed the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:28.410" style="s2">black intellectual roundtable will there</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.799" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">be more also I didn&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.410" end="00:51:31.319" style="s2">Brett&#39;s final recommendation about what</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:36.269" style="s2">he thought they should focus on was it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.319" end="00:51:38.039" style="s2">corruption okay first of all there will</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.269" end="00:51:39.960" style="s2">be more I&#39;d like to do another round</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.039" end="00:51:41.609" style="s2">table I&#39;d certainly do another round</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.960" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">table with the same folks but there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.609" end="00:51:45.180" style="s2">also other folks who weren&#39;t in on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.039" style="s2">one who I think would be great as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.180" end="00:51:49.950" style="s2">and you get a very different perspective</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.039" end="00:51:51.779" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s potentially something</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.950" end="00:51:52.740" style="s2">that might happen in the future there</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.779" end="00:51:54.269" style="s2">will certainly be follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.740" end="00:51:55.710" style="s2">conversations with individuals who were</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.269" end="00:51:57.329" style="s2">present in that roundtable all right let</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.710" end="00:51:58.650" style="s2">me say before you address this the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.329" end="00:52:01.559" style="s2">second part this question that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.650" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">gonna be : Hughes is invited you on his</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.559" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">podcast you&#39;re gonna be doing that soon</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:09.690" style="s2">I think yes I believe this week um I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:12.269" style="s2">gonna stick with Tsun Tsun yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.690" end="00:52:14.339" style="s2">definitely soon okay soon so anyway yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.269" end="00:52:15.960" style="s2">the conversations are continuing and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.339" end="00:52:17.450" style="s2">look forward to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.960" end="00:52:20.009" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to remember how the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.450" end="00:52:24.059" style="s2">roundtable ended and what the questioner</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.009" end="00:52:28.200" style="s2">is asking about but yes the there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.059" end="00:52:31.410" style="s2">enough room to explore unity 2020 in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.200" end="00:52:33.990" style="s2">that roundtable but the basic point was</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.410" end="00:52:35.460" style="s2">we have a chronic problem the chronic</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.990" end="00:52:37.380" style="s2">problem comes from the corruption of our</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.460" end="00:52:39.509" style="s2">system which prevents normal democratic</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.380" end="00:52:42.750" style="s2">mechanisms from addressing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.509" end="00:52:44.819" style="s2">absence of those mechanisms people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.750" end="00:52:47.009" style="s2">registering that they are frozen out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.819" end="00:52:48.869" style="s2">well being and they&#39;re reacting to it in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.009" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">a predictable way and the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.869" end="00:52:54.059" style="s2">this is to put them back in a position</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:56.579" style="s2">that policy serves their interests and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.059" end="00:52:58.650" style="s2">that we can continue advancing the ball</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.579" end="00:53:00.220" style="s2">with respect to making the country truly</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.650" end="00:53:04.570" style="s2">fair and inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.220" end="00:53:05.590" style="s2">so my argument would be that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.570" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">thing that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.590" end="00:53:09.490" style="s2">voting for Biden doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:11.859" style="s2">because Biden is going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.490" end="00:53:14.680" style="s2">amplifying he&#39;s going to be and the DNC</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.859" end="00:53:16.180" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna cynically partner with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.680" end="00:53:18.820" style="s2">movement which is going to amplify</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.180" end="00:53:21.480" style="s2">racial tensions and it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.820" end="00:53:25.180" style="s2">provide cover for the rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.480" end="00:53:27.849" style="s2">elites that have corrupted policy for so</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.180" end="00:53:29.349" style="s2">long so I do think it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.849" end="00:53:31.540" style="s2">solution because in effect</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.349" end="00:53:33.250" style="s2">the conclusion in that roundtable and</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.540" end="00:53:35.650" style="s2">what you&#39;ve heard us say here is that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.250" end="00:53:37.570" style="s2">are in effect in effect being divided</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.650" end="00:53:39.940" style="s2">which is to someone else&#39;s benefit</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.570" end="00:53:42.580" style="s2">rather than being United and galvanized</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.940" end="00:53:46.869" style="s2">for the purpose of making America</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.580" end="00:53:48.190" style="s2">deliver on its promise why don&#39;t we hear</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.869" end="00:53:51.130" style="s2">any talk about getting the money out of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.190" end="00:53:54.940" style="s2">politics we used to we used to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.130" end="00:53:57.970" style="s2">about that a lot and and it has not been</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.940" end="00:54:01.540" style="s2">the main the main thrust for the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.970" end="00:54:05.589" style="s2">few elections since was it oh boy a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.540" end="00:54:09.010" style="s2">mccain feingold is that the original it</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.589" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">is but I also think earlier in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.010" end="00:54:12.520" style="s2">process it might have been as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:14.260" style="s2">getting the money out of politics the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.520" end="00:54:17.980" style="s2">mechanisms through which corruption now</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.260" end="00:54:22.119" style="s2">functions are many and varied so in</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.980" end="00:54:24.130" style="s2">essence you need an anti-corruption set</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.119" end="00:54:25.720" style="s2">of policies that deals with all of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.130" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">because any time you leave a leak that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.720" end="00:54:29.619" style="s2">leak is going to be used to enlarge</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:32.380" style="s2">itself and ultimately will be returned</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.619" end="00:54:38.380" style="s2">here so get the money out of politics is</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.380" end="00:54:40.330" style="s2">I think a useful but inadequate version</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.380" end="00:54:42.490" style="s2">of what we are now talking about which</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.330" end="00:54:44.560" style="s2">is addressing all of the mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.490" end="00:54:48.520" style="s2">corruption that prevent governance from</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.560" end="00:54:53.050" style="s2">functioning okay one more here cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.520" end="00:54:54.430" style="s2">a it&#39;s a timely comment I just found out</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.050" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">that my long term girlfriend is pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.430" end="00:54:59.080" style="s2">with our first here&#39;s the Unity 2020 and</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.450" end="00:55:07.660" style="s2">and here&#39;s to that indeed yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.170" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">skipping to the questions that have come</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.660" end="00:55:13.290" style="s2">in this hour Zack have you drawn a line</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:13.290" style="s2">I&#39;m not seeing where</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.690" end="00:55:17.750" style="s2">where we&#39;re supposed to be so while zach</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.370" end="00:55:21.260" style="s2">is drawing a line I&#39;m gonna go out back</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.750" end="00:55:25.550" style="s2">and pull in one more question from last</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.260" end="00:55:27.230" style="s2">livestream which is this in your last</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.550" end="00:55:28.820" style="s2">stream Brett said that there is a kernel</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.230" end="00:55:30.620" style="s2">of truth within critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.820" end="00:55:33.290" style="s2">what is this kernel and what reason do</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.620" end="00:55:37.370" style="s2">we have for believing it the kernel of</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.290" end="00:55:39.980" style="s2">truth is this everything that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.370" end="00:55:42.440" style="s2">that you believe that you think that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.980" end="00:55:45.740" style="s2">conclude that you surmise all of it has</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.440" end="00:55:47.750" style="s2">come through perception right whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.740" end="00:55:49.670" style="s2">you were perceiving words on a page that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.750" end="00:55:51.770" style="s2">reported an experiment that you were in</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.670" end="00:55:54.410" style="s2">present at or you were running the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.770" end="00:55:59.120" style="s2">experiment and you saw the results and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.410" end="00:56:00.320" style="s2">you took the data whatever you know had</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.120" end="00:56:01.610" style="s2">to come through your perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.320" end="00:56:03.050" style="s2">apparatus because it has no other</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.610" end="00:56:06.820" style="s2">mechanism for having gotten into your</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.050" end="00:56:09.620" style="s2">mind so that creates a hazard because</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.820" end="00:56:11.420" style="s2">perceptual apparatus is not there to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.620" end="00:56:13.130" style="s2">literally report the world it&#39;s there to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.420" end="00:56:15.770" style="s2">efficiently report the world in a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.130" end="00:56:19.400" style="s2">that is useful most of the time right</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.770" end="00:56:22.670" style="s2">so that has biases built into it which</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.400" end="00:56:26.810" style="s2">we call heuristics those heuristics can</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.670" end="00:56:28.550" style="s2">cause prejudices however that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.810" end="00:56:30.410" style="s2">the end of the kernel of truth right the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.550" end="00:56:31.640" style="s2">kernel of truth is bias is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.410" end="00:56:33.560" style="s2">right down to the level of what your</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.640" end="00:56:36.290" style="s2">eyes tell you is in front of you right</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.560" end="00:56:38.750" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s so unambiguous that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.290" end="00:56:41.870" style="s2">there&#39;s no problem right the tables here</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.750" end="00:56:43.730" style="s2">in front of me I can see it it looks it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.870" end="00:56:45.020" style="s2">looks like an actual object even though</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.730" end="00:56:47.330" style="s2">the rendering of it is in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.020" end="00:56:51.320" style="s2">however there are lots of things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.330" end="00:56:53.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t like that so the remedy is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.320" end="00:56:54.680" style="s2">scientific method the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.000" end="00:56:56.750" style="s2">scientific method is to allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.680" end="00:56:58.730" style="s2">detect what is true in spite of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.750" end="00:57:01.070" style="s2">that your perceptual apparatus doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.730" end="00:57:04.040" style="s2">register it correctly on first pass</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.070" end="00:57:06.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what the method is for and so to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.040" end="00:57:08.060" style="s2">the extent that critical theory proceeds</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.140" end="00:57:10.520" style="s2">from the observation that bias is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.060" end="00:57:13.490" style="s2">potentially and everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.520" end="00:57:15.530" style="s2">perceive the right answer to it is yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.490" end="00:57:17.570" style="s2">that&#39;s why we need more and better</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.530" end="00:57:19.250" style="s2">science to detect the places where we</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.570" end="00:57:20.540" style="s2">have misunderstood the world and we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.250" end="00:57:22.070" style="s2">understand them and that has you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.540" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">that&#39;s true about everything including</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.070" end="00:57:27.800" style="s2">racial bias so the kernel of truth is</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:30.140" style="s2">reception is dangerous because it has</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.800" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">heuristics built into it but then</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.140" end="00:57:34.940" style="s2">critical theory immediately goes off the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:40.250" style="s2">rails by then arguing against a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.940" end="00:57:42.350" style="s2">scientific approach rather than for next</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.250" end="00:57:45.080" style="s2">question are the values of equal rights</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.350" end="00:57:47.210" style="s2">and worth in liberal philosophy only</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.080" end="00:57:49.610" style="s2">metaphorically true or are there</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.210" end="00:57:51.230" style="s2">objective underpinnings to them Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.610" end="00:57:55.580" style="s2">Peterson presents individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.230" end="00:57:57.140" style="s2">religious that is metaphoric tones yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.580" end="00:58:00.140" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.140" end="00:58:01.970" style="s2">and I think you can see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.140" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">in the question about a colorblind</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.970" end="00:58:08.420" style="s2">society so the idea of a colorblind</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:11.510" style="s2">society has of late been mocked because</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.420" end="00:58:14.360" style="s2">it appears so the way it is marked is</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.510" end="00:58:17.030" style="s2">that it is as if people who suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.360" end="00:58:18.890" style="s2">a colorblind society is desirable have</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.030" end="00:58:20.540" style="s2">said that they don&#39;t see race for</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.890" end="00:58:23.530" style="s2">example right which is obviously an</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.540" end="00:58:26.450" style="s2">insane claim the point though is</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.530" end="00:58:29.240" style="s2">colorblind it does not mean you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.450" end="00:58:32.870" style="s2">see race it means that at the structural</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.240" end="00:58:35.450" style="s2">level it plays no role so when you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.870" end="00:58:37.160" style="s2">colorblind think of blind justice right</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.450" end="00:58:40.520" style="s2">the statue with the blindfold over her</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.160" end="00:58:43.580" style="s2">eyes and the and the scales and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.520" end="00:58:45.710" style="s2">point is it&#39;s not like the court can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.580" end="00:58:48.770" style="s2">know what your background is but your</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.710" end="00:58:50.540" style="s2">background can have no implication for</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.770" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">whether or not you know for how the law</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.540" end="00:58:54.680" style="s2">is applied right something has to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:56.930" style="s2">criminal for all of us or for nobody and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.680" end="00:58:58.700" style="s2">you know this fails we&#39;ve seen for</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.930" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">example during the crack epidemic that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.700" end="00:59:03.220" style="s2">crack and cocaine were punished very</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:05.630" style="s2">differently and there was a different</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.220" end="00:59:08.120" style="s2">racial makeup of the people likely to</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.630" end="00:59:10.850" style="s2">get ensnared in legal proceedings over</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.120" end="00:59:13.100" style="s2">using and trafficking in these things so</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.850" end="00:59:15.580" style="s2">there are biases in the law but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.100" end="00:59:18.230" style="s2">that the law aspires to be colorblind is</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.580" end="00:59:19.700" style="s2">the right objective it has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.230" end="00:59:20.980" style="s2">right objective there&#39;s no other decent</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.700" end="00:59:25.700" style="s2">way we&#39;re going to be able to run</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.980" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">civilization so what I would say is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.700" end="00:59:29.030" style="s2">is not that the claim is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.200" end="00:59:31.460" style="s2">no differences obviously there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.030" end="00:59:33.890" style="s2">difference between men and women that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.460" end="00:59:35.810" style="s2">difference is rooted in deepest biology</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.890" end="00:59:39.230" style="s2">right some of it is superficial some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.810" end="00:59:39.830" style="s2">it is very deep however you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.230" end="00:59:43.160" style="s2">crime</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.830" end="00:59:45.740" style="s2">of murder if you kill somebody the law</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.160" end="00:59:47.180" style="s2">has to treat you similarly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.740" end="00:59:49.160" style="s2">male or female right it doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.180" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">implication about what you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.160" end="00:59:53.990" style="s2">or not you&#39;re entitled to take another</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.480" end="00:59:56.450" style="s2">life so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a claim about</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.990" end="00:59:59.290" style="s2">us all being alike it is a claim about</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.450" end="01:00:03.290" style="s2">how the system has to view us when it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.290" end="01:00:05.510" style="s2">rewarding and punishing us yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.290" end="01:00:08.350" style="s2">touched on this before it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.510" end="01:00:14.290" style="s2">conflation of equal means the same as</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.350" end="01:00:17.810" style="s2">yeah you know or means identical to yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.290" end="01:00:21.380" style="s2">our human sisters who share dad&#39;s rich</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.810" end="01:00:23.330" style="s2">ex more related than brothers a second</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.380" end="01:00:24.800" style="s2">question if we switched in embryos why</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.330" end="01:00:26.360" style="s2">for another why with the baby have</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.800" end="01:00:28.490" style="s2">almost the same genotype and phenotype</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.360" end="01:00:31.340" style="s2">as a twin brother with regular dads why</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.490" end="01:00:33.860" style="s2">so the same question I don&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.340" end="01:00:35.540" style="s2">what that first one our human sisters</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.860" end="01:00:37.790" style="s2">who shared dad&#39;s rich ex more related</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.540" end="01:00:39.890" style="s2">than brothers is is a fun one all right</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.790" end="01:00:42.110" style="s2">so the idea is we&#39;ve got 23 paired</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.890" end="01:00:44.750" style="s2">chromosomes and at that 23rd position</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.110" end="01:00:47.390" style="s2">the X which looks very much like all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.750" end="01:00:49.670" style="s2">other 22 pairs is a much bigger</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.390" end="01:00:51.770" style="s2">chromosome than the Y bigger and has</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.670" end="01:00:54.770" style="s2">much more information even right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.770" end="01:00:58.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s bigger by mass molecular mass</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.770" end="01:01:01.850" style="s2">and it has more coding genes on it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.190" end="01:01:04.280" style="s2">so that means that actually females have</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.850" end="01:01:07.850" style="s2">larger genotypes that and have larger</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.280" end="01:01:11.840" style="s2">genomes then then males and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.850" end="01:01:16.700" style="s2">given that there&#39;s a larger genome to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.840" end="01:01:17.990" style="s2">had with well there&#39;s a larger to nutria</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.700" end="01:01:21.310" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t inherently make you more</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.990" end="01:01:21.310" style="s2">related but it means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:27.080" style="s2">because it depends on exactly what no no</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.610" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">I do I think the answer to the question</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.080" end="01:01:30.520" style="s2">think the answer is yes but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:32.750" style="s2">actually I could just got stuck in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.520" end="01:01:35.690" style="s2">nitty-gritty one math here I think we</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.750" end="01:01:40.040" style="s2">can get there okay um tell me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.690" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">wrong but me and you always do me so if</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.040" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">you are born if you&#39;re human or if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:50.180" style="s2">are a eutherian mammals that thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:53.420" style="s2">I&#39;ll cop to okay yes and you are you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.180" end="01:01:57.730" style="s2">were are therefore born with</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.420" end="01:01:59.990" style="s2">your father&#39;s un-- recombined</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.730" end="01:02:02.660" style="s2">x-chromosome because he doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.990" end="01:02:04.849" style="s2">second X chromosome with which can the X</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.660" end="01:02:07.369" style="s2">recombine actually that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.849" end="01:02:09.559" style="s2">future itself I believe if you&#39;re female</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.369" end="01:02:11.059" style="s2">and you have 2x but if you&#39;re male can</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.559" end="01:02:12.740" style="s2">your X recombine it was a thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.059" end="01:02:15.170" style="s2">something with which to recomm so if</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.740" end="01:02:17.270" style="s2">you&#39;re a female you have an unrefined X</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.170" end="01:02:18.410" style="s2">from your right there&#39;s no so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.270" end="01:02:20.540" style="s2">have to say on recombined that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.410" end="01:02:22.010" style="s2">right I&#39;m just saying it so it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.540" end="01:02:23.809" style="s2">it&#39;s clear with a logic comes from so</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.010" end="01:02:31.160" style="s2">the X is going to be one of your X&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.809" end="01:02:34.220" style="s2">will be unrecognizably then you have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.160" end="01:02:36.589" style="s2">identical X which does drive up but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.220" end="01:02:39.950" style="s2">Y is also one recombined so full</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.589" end="01:02:41.809" style="s2">brothers also have identical was our two</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.950" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">sons of identical wise as well so nice</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.809" end="01:02:47.240" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m like trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:49.010" style="s2">out what the the larger genome but the X</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.240" end="01:02:51.530" style="s2">that is a hundred percent inherited from</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.010" end="01:02:54.260" style="s2">the dad for two full sisters as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.530" end="01:02:56.030" style="s2">to a smaller genome but a Y which is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.260" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">smaller percentage of the genome that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.030" end="01:03:00.079" style="s2">a hundred percent inherited from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:02.329" style="s2">father by two four brothers which which</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:04.430" style="s2">one is more fully related yeah no I</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.329" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">agree that&#39;s that&#39;s a confound and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.430" end="01:03:08.299" style="s2">the problem here is this depends it</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:11.540" style="s2">depends on how you do the calculation</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.299" end="01:03:14.329" style="s2">because the Y being almost devoid of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.540" end="01:03:16.819" style="s2">genetic content intuitively seems like</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.329" end="01:03:19.220" style="s2">it contributes less to the calculation</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.819" end="01:03:21.109" style="s2">right having an identical Y that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.220" end="01:03:22.700" style="s2">contains almost nothing seems like it</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.109" end="01:03:26.059" style="s2">fit contribute very little it&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.700" end="01:03:29.390" style="s2">important things in motion yeah just a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.059" end="01:03:34.040" style="s2">few right it&#39;s like the nuclear trigger</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.390" end="01:03:35.270" style="s2">you know it yeah but anyway so I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.040" end="01:03:36.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a different difficult question to</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.270" end="01:03:39.290" style="s2">answer because you have to define your</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.920" end="01:03:40.670" style="s2">terms and so how you calculate</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.290" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">relatedness you know as we&#39;ve pointed</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.670" end="01:03:49.660" style="s2">out in a prior live stream the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">you and a chimpanzee might be 98%</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.660" end="01:03:53.750" style="s2">related but then we say that you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:55.400" style="s2">50% related to a full sibling</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.750" end="01:03:59.059" style="s2">obviously suggests that those aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.400" end="01:04:00.770" style="s2">same calculation so anyway it depends</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.059" end="01:04:02.180" style="s2">define your terms and we can answer the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.770" end="01:04:03.710" style="s2">question although it would probably take</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.180" end="01:04:05.640" style="s2">a little puzzling and a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.710" end="01:04:08.199" style="s2">but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.640" end="01:04:10.539" style="s2">do you track the second question here I</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.199" end="01:04:12.940" style="s2">don&#39;t quite if we switch if we switched</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.539" end="01:04:14.349" style="s2">in embryos why for another why would the</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.940" end="01:04:16.690" style="s2">baby have almost the same genotype and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.349" end="01:04:20.499" style="s2">phenotype as a twin brother with regular</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.690" end="01:04:22.449" style="s2">dads why oh yeah so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.499" end="01:04:24.190" style="s2">what regular dad&#39;s why I think I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.449" end="01:04:25.900" style="s2">sure what regularly inherited I think is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.190" end="01:04:27.759" style="s2">what it means so the question is if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.900" end="01:04:30.309" style="s2">if you could without disturbing the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.759" end="01:04:32.979" style="s2">embryo and that&#39;s a if but if you could</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.309" end="01:04:35.589" style="s2">pluck out a Y and substitute a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.979" end="01:04:40.029" style="s2">human Y it would have almost no</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.589" end="01:04:42.819" style="s2">implication for the embryo and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.029" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">developing creature because and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.819" end="01:04:47.589" style="s2">mind you this is subject as far as we</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:49.779" style="s2">know where as far as we know but because</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.589" end="01:04:52.479" style="s2">their reason isn&#39;t s skating a series of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.779" end="01:04:55.719" style="s2">events towards masculinization but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.479" end="01:04:57.369" style="s2">way in which that masculinization occurs</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.719" end="01:04:59.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be highly variable</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.369" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">between y&#39;s right it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.319" end="01:05:02.949" style="s2">single signal that says go down this</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:04.420" style="s2">pathway rather than that pathway and</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.949" end="01:05:06.430" style="s2">probably it doesn&#39;t matter which male</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.420" end="01:05:08.829" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that signal from the point is</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.430" end="01:05:11.499" style="s2">the content of what kind of male you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.829" end="01:05:13.209" style="s2">gonna be is the result of things on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.499" end="01:05:15.279" style="s2">autosomes that is to say the non-sex</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.209" end="01:05:17.410" style="s2">chromosomes so yes i&#39;ve my prediction</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.279" end="01:05:20.619" style="s2">based on your question as this echo</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.410" end="01:05:25.719" style="s2">would be almost die they would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.619" end="01:05:27.759" style="s2">effectively identical twins cool george</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.719" end="01:05:30.759" style="s2">knapp was just on Jerry I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.759" end="01:05:32.349" style="s2">George Knapp is to you so here&#39;s a fun</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.759" end="01:05:33.579" style="s2">one for you the question continues do</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.349" end="01:05:39.279" style="s2">you believe that we have been visited by</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.579" end="01:05:40.989" style="s2">aliens why are why not no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.279" end="01:05:45.759" style="s2">believe we&#39;ve been visited bit by aliens</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.989" end="01:05:47.859" style="s2">because there&#39;s not substantive</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.759" end="01:05:49.779" style="s2">I will say you know I think you go down</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.859" end="01:05:53.829" style="s2">this rabbit hole yeah and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.779" end="01:05:57.369" style="s2">of evidence of UFOs right lots of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.829" end="01:05:58.630" style="s2">but UFO just means unidentified which</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.369" end="01:06:00.009" style="s2">means you don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.630" end="01:06:02.579" style="s2">own government playing game some other</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.009" end="01:06:08.920" style="s2">government playing games</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.579" end="01:06:10.690" style="s2">misunderstanding but well dude just</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.920" end="01:06:14.170" style="s2">between you me and the small number of</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.690" end="01:06:15.640" style="s2">people who may see this there is some</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.170" end="01:06:17.230" style="s2">pretty interesting stuff that is now</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.640" end="01:06:19.180" style="s2">being acknowledged about</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.230" end="01:06:22.119" style="s2">for example military pilots who have</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.180" end="01:06:25.660" style="s2">encountered phenomenon appears to defy a</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.119" end="01:06:27.700" style="s2">natural explanation sure so what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.660" end="01:06:30.970" style="s2">- I think that&#39;s aliens having visited</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.700" end="01:06:33.250" style="s2">the earth I do not I&#39;m open to being</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.970" end="01:06:36.250" style="s2">persuaded that it is no I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.250" end="01:06:40.270" style="s2">you know I said no right away but we got</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.250" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">a question a while ago about hmm I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.270" end="01:06:44.200" style="s2">we got a question you know do you think</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:47.350" style="s2">there&#39;s other intelligent life in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.200" end="01:06:49.150" style="s2">universe and my sense is it has to have</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.350" end="01:06:52.540" style="s2">evolved whether or not it still exists</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.150" end="01:06:54.670" style="s2">now just in terms of statistical</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.540" end="01:06:56.440" style="s2">likelihood and the conditions necessary</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.670" end="01:07:00.820" style="s2">and all this for consciousness I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.440" end="01:07:02.830" style="s2">it would be stunningly unlikely for</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.820" end="01:07:04.750" style="s2">there not to be some other form of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.830" end="01:07:06.730" style="s2">intelligent life in the universe I am</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.750" end="01:07:08.320" style="s2">more certain of that conclusion than I</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.730" end="01:07:10.390" style="s2">am of the conclusion that there have</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.320" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">been no aliens visiting earth I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.390" end="01:07:15.369" style="s2">it&#39;s really unlikely that aliens have</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:17.619" style="s2">visited earth but there&#39;s a whole lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.369" end="01:07:18.940" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t hinge on that like you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.619" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">we there&#39;s just a lot of stuff that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.940" end="01:07:25.359" style="s2">can&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know and I also</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:27.400" style="s2">have very little vested in the answer so</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.359" end="01:07:29.290" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to be cool I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.400" end="01:07:33.160" style="s2">unless they were here to kill us no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.290" end="01:07:34.900" style="s2">uh well two things one I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.160" end="01:07:36.280" style="s2">you mean other intelligent life is there</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.900" end="01:07:39.040" style="s2">intelligent life in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.280" end="01:07:46.690" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it&#39;s probable well our dogs</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.040" end="01:07:49.930" style="s2">in the room but with respect to the UFO</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.690" end="01:07:53.320" style="s2">thing yeah if it was true I mean look if</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.930" end="01:07:57.609" style="s2">it is true that aliens have visited the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.320" end="01:07:59.950" style="s2">earth then the evidence of that suggests</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.609" end="01:08:03.430" style="s2">that they are actually actively visiting</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.950" end="01:08:05.890" style="s2">right in other words these phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.430" end="01:08:08.560" style="s2">that are difficult to explain through</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.890" end="01:08:11.080" style="s2">normal mechanisms would suggest active</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.560" end="01:08:13.210" style="s2">visitation if there was active is it a</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.080" end="01:08:15.250" style="s2">ssin which I do not believe there is but</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.210" end="01:08:19.330" style="s2">again that&#39;s waited that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.250" end="01:08:22.180" style="s2">that&#39;s less likely what that there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.330" end="01:08:23.859" style="s2">active ongoing visitation well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.180" end="01:08:25.930" style="s2">you know it depends what you mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.859" end="01:08:28.420" style="s2">got where would they have come from</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.930" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">right not the solar system yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.420" end="01:08:31.900" style="s2">elsewheres right</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:34.569" style="s2">so if they had arrived here from</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.900" end="01:08:37.150" style="s2">somewhere over some very great distance</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.569" end="01:08:40.569" style="s2">and we are seeing them in not only</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.150" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">historical times but you know with some</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.569" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">regularity we&#39;ve see these phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:46.359" style="s2">that are not explicable now again I</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:48.279" style="s2">don&#39;t think that these are aliens from</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.359" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">elsewhere visiting the earth but if they</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.279" end="01:08:52.600" style="s2">are I think the point is though that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:54.940" style="s2">an ongoing something-or-other so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.600" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">the question maybe if there&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.940" end="01:09:01.870" style="s2">something or other okay wouldn&#39;t it be</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">worth our while to try to reach them and</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.870" end="01:09:09.040" style="s2">get their help for example for example</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:10.270" style="s2">were there aliens who were interested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.040" end="01:09:13.390" style="s2">us for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.270" end="01:09:15.609" style="s2">right yep right you know a Starman</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.390" end="01:09:17.380" style="s2">waiting in the sky he&#39;d like to come and</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.609" end="01:09:18.969" style="s2">meet us but he thinks he&#39;d blow our mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.380" end="01:09:20.890" style="s2">well maybe the point is well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.969" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">willing to have our minds blown right</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.890" end="01:09:26.410" style="s2">because maybe they have the secret to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:28.299" style="s2">fusion power do you realize how much</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.410" end="01:09:31.719" style="s2">better the planet would get if we could</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.299" end="01:09:33.549" style="s2">get fusion power and govern it properly</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.719" end="01:09:35.770" style="s2">right we could solve we could not only</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.549" end="01:09:36.969" style="s2">halt global climate change we could</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.770" end="01:09:39.009" style="s2">reverse it we could do all sorts if</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.969" end="01:09:41.620" style="s2">they&#39;re here they probably do right well</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.009" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">exactly right we know it&#39;s possible so</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.620" end="01:09:45.279" style="s2">if they&#39;re here right I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">they&#39;re here but I&#39;m saying if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.279" end="01:09:49.900" style="s2">thought they were here wouldn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:51.370" style="s2">thing to do be to try to talk them into</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.900" end="01:09:56.770" style="s2">revealing themselves and helping us out</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.370" end="01:09:57.219" style="s2">because we&#39;re in big trouble I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.770" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">kidding</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.219" end="01:10:01.449" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like the right number</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:02.739" style="s2">of lottery tickets to buy is one right</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.449" end="01:10:04.690" style="s2">if you&#39;re wrong about the way the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.739" end="01:10:07.000" style="s2">universe works one lottery ticket allows</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.690" end="01:10:09.489" style="s2">some force in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.000" end="01:10:11.230" style="s2">- yeah solve your problems zero does not</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.489" end="01:10:13.210" style="s2">said the guy who I think has never</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.230" end="01:10:18.250" style="s2">bought a lottery ticket yeah right right</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.210" end="01:10:21.219" style="s2">yeah nor has our dog nor by indeed okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.250" end="01:10:22.420" style="s2">love to interview with dr. mu and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.219" end="01:10:24.130" style="s2">preparing for my eventual root</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.420" end="01:10:26.320" style="s2">resorption since I had braces when I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.130" end="01:10:29.320" style="s2">in my teens what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.320" end="01:10:31.030" style="s2">evolutionary optometry oh so this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.320" end="01:10:33.460" style="s2">like this is a question we sort of asked</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.030" end="01:10:35.530" style="s2">on whenever we were first talking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.460" end="01:10:37.270" style="s2">this and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.530" end="01:10:39.300" style="s2">who&#39;s doing this work although we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.270" end="01:10:40.989" style="s2">seen a few we&#39;ve received a few emails</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.300" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">suggesting there might be some good</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.989" end="01:10:45.400" style="s2">people out there and we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:46.690" style="s2">this a bit yeah it&#39;s long overdue I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.400" end="01:10:48.910" style="s2">the fact is as you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.690" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">okay there&#39;s there&#39;s words I mean but</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.910" end="01:10:52.300" style="s2">the question presumes that it already</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:53.530" style="s2">exists and we just don&#39;t we&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.300" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">know in the conversation yet I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.530" end="01:10:58.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about it but I am there is</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:11:00.340" style="s2">some discussion of it whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.270" end="01:11:02.620" style="s2">anybody actively working in</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.340" end="01:11:05.650" style="s2">ophthalmology who has an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.620" end="01:11:08.199" style="s2">bent that is you know above laughable I</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.650" end="01:11:09.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know I have yet to encounter them</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.199" end="01:11:11.739" style="s2">if they exist I would love to know what</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.910" end="01:11:13.960" style="s2">what they&#39;re up to because I do think we</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.739" end="01:11:16.690" style="s2">are screwing up our eyes badly that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.960" end="01:11:19.150" style="s2">could be doing vastly better and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.690" end="01:11:20.710" style="s2">you know this is just one more way in</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.150" end="01:11:21.969" style="s2">which we squander human potential by</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.710" end="01:11:23.650" style="s2">pretending that all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.969" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">evolutionary things aren&#39;t evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.650" end="01:11:29.260" style="s2">so we welcome it if it&#39;s out there maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:32.530" style="s2">we&#39;ll hear about it yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.260" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">what the next question means sjw equals</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.530" end="01:11:38.410" style="s2">pora Corey Yakuza sure I&#39;m butchering</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:40.810" style="s2">that in Japanese which means PC mafia</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.410" end="01:11:47.380" style="s2">seems like a more apt name what do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.810" end="01:11:49.120" style="s2">think PC mafia I just I just can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.380" end="01:11:51.940" style="s2">anything about what the Japanese means</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.120" end="01:11:54.610" style="s2">so yep know what the connotations are I</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.940" end="01:11:55.300" style="s2">yeah I think you know we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.610" end="01:11:58.510" style="s2">to politely</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.300" end="01:12:01.420" style="s2">sidestep that and say this is its own</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.510" end="01:12:03.429" style="s2">phenomenon it&#39;s dangerous we would</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.420" end="01:12:07.090" style="s2">welcome people within the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.429" end="01:12:09.550" style="s2">waking up to the danger and attempting</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.090" end="01:12:12.390" style="s2">to pursue actual justice in some way</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.550" end="01:12:15.250" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t going to destroy everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.390" end="01:12:17.440" style="s2">well both of you interview at Richard</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.250" end="01:12:18.940" style="s2">Hart he&#39;s recently released a product</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.440" end="01:12:23.320" style="s2">that is the dark horse of cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.940" end="01:12:26.440" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to use mmm that&#39;s welding Zak</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.320" end="01:12:29.560" style="s2">you want to highlight that uh the one</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.440" end="01:12:32.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve got half assed highlighted I did</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.560" end="01:12:35.800" style="s2">say when I was on Peter McCormick&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.010" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">podcast his crypto podcast that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.800" end="01:12:40.150" style="s2">thought the key thing was that crypto</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:43.480" style="s2">remains too hard to use for it to catch</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.150" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">on and the analogy I used was the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.480" end="01:12:47.949" style="s2">difference between PGP and protonmail</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">right protonmail works because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.949" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">have to exchange keys and all it does it</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:56.190" style="s2">seamlessly and so I was saying</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.040" end="01:12:57.480" style="s2">the crypto needs that layer in order for</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.190" end="01:12:59.880" style="s2">it to actually achieve its potential</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.480" end="01:13:03.330" style="s2">which I quite believe so anyway maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.880" end="01:13:06.510" style="s2">maybe Richard Hart&#39;s got it yeah someone</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.330" end="01:13:08.190" style="s2">has given a lot of money to ask to say I</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.510" end="01:13:09.960" style="s2">would love to talk find me on Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.190" end="01:13:12.870" style="s2">landon doc hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.960" end="01:13:16.470" style="s2">so oh no sack you want to highlight that</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.870" end="01:13:20.220" style="s2">to the theoretical physicists dr7</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.470" end="01:13:21.990" style="s2">Sabine Sabine Sabina Sabine Sabean</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.220" end="01:13:23.400" style="s2">Hassan Felder would be a great interview</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.260" end="01:13:45.300" style="s2">fascinating fascinating person from my</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.650" end="01:13:46.980" style="s2">perspective many of these postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.300" end="01:13:48.900" style="s2">movements at their core are personal</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.980" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">traumas being acted out unconsciously on</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.900" end="01:13:52.860" style="s2">a mass scale how do you combat something</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:54.750" style="s2">but at its root is emotional and not</p>

<p begin="01:13:54.750" end="01:14:00.150" style="s2">thoughts yeah I agree with us and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.010" end="01:14:03.480" style="s2">know we&#39;re I think we&#39;re often talking</p>

<p begin="01:14:03.480" end="01:14:07.320" style="s2">are simultaneously saying ok but you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.310" end="01:14:09.180" style="s2">know this thing is you know it has its</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.180" end="01:14:14.580" style="s2">traditions and then it was being taught</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.090" end="01:14:16.080" style="s2">and indoctrinated at universities well</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.520" end="01:15:01.350" style="s2">behind it does miss the individual</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:03.710" style="s2">psychological level and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.350" end="01:15:06.470" style="s2">have so many people who</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.710" end="01:15:09.050" style="s2">are unregulated dysregulated do not have</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.470" end="01:15:13.070" style="s2">any way to confront their own</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.050" end="01:15:15.500" style="s2">psychologies and emotions and make real</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.070" end="01:15:17.210" style="s2">connection and meaning in the world so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.500" end="01:15:18.380" style="s2">would just point out the connection of</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.210" end="01:15:20.930" style="s2">this to the rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.380" end="01:15:24.860" style="s2">thing because yeah what you have is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.930" end="01:15:27.410" style="s2">bunch of people making a profit by not</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.860" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">only failing to serve the interests of</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.410" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">people but in many cases actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.210" end="01:15:36.710" style="s2">maiming them psychologically and</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.950" end="01:15:40.090" style="s2">otherwise you know yes so you know this</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.710" end="01:15:41.570" style="s2">happens from orthodontia through</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.090" end="01:15:43.100" style="s2">pharmacological treatment of</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.570" end="01:15:46.130" style="s2">psychological disorders you just have</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.100" end="01:15:47.930" style="s2">all of these profit-making centers that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.130" end="01:15:51.970" style="s2">actually do a lot of harm to people and</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.930" end="01:15:54.890" style="s2">have left them in many ways incapable of</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.970" end="01:15:56.330" style="s2">doing what needs to be done which then</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.890" end="01:15:57.860" style="s2">leaves them feeling betrayed and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.330" end="01:16:00.410" style="s2">not wrong that they&#39;ve been betrayed but</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.860" end="01:16:02.750" style="s2">they have misdiagnosed the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.410" end="01:16:06.830" style="s2">betrayal so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.750" end="01:16:10.550" style="s2">let&#39;s deal with the rent-seeking okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.830" end="01:16:12.050" style="s2">let&#39;s do who do three more sure okay are</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.550" end="01:16:15.710" style="s2">there any schools left that resemble</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.050" end="01:16:19.550" style="s2">what you loved about evergreen four</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.710" end="01:16:21.200" style="s2">evergreen was actually was unique there</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.550" end="01:16:23.090" style="s2">was there was no place else that did</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.200" end="01:16:24.890" style="s2">that there are some schools that did you</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.090" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">know blog system you three weeks at a</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.890" end="01:16:31.040" style="s2">time intensive with one group of</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:33.020" style="s2">students and one faculty but being able</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.040" end="01:16:35.750" style="s2">to be with the same group of people</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.020" end="01:16:38.720" style="s2">full-time for a quarter or two quarters</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.750" end="01:16:41.450" style="s2">an entire academic year and have that be</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.720" end="01:16:43.930" style="s2">the extent of your academic work for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.450" end="01:16:46.850" style="s2">year there&#39;s nothing else like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.930" end="01:16:48.530" style="s2">actually and that there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.850" end="01:16:51.920" style="s2">there are a lot of new pedagogical</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.530" end="01:16:53.750" style="s2">structures that evergreen created when</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.920" end="01:16:55.730" style="s2">it was formed in the late 60s early 70s</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.750" end="01:16:57.170" style="s2">and some of them I think weren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.730" end="01:16:59.200" style="s2">important someone have been used</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.170" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">elsewhere but that thing right there</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.200" end="01:17:05.030" style="s2">which was being dismantled in the last</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:07.780" style="s2">year or two that we were there as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.030" end="01:17:11.840" style="s2">was just it begun to be dismantled</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.780" end="01:17:12.260" style="s2">really meant that there was no place</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.840" end="01:17:15.140" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.260" end="01:17:17.130" style="s2">actually that was evergreen like in its</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.140" end="01:17:20.610" style="s2">most unique and important</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.130" end="01:17:22.980" style="s2">feature yep now if you were to try to</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.610" end="01:17:24.900" style="s2">set something up that did that I would</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.980" end="01:17:26.369" style="s2">say we learned a lot about what didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.900" end="01:17:28.849" style="s2">work about it too and while our</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.369" end="01:17:30.810" style="s2">community was incredible and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.849" end="01:17:33.659" style="s2">depended on the fact that actually we</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.810" end="01:17:35.790" style="s2">were really interested in figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.659" end="01:17:38.280" style="s2">what could be done with the freedom that</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.790" end="01:17:39.929" style="s2">we had which was essentially told um</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.280" end="01:17:42.060" style="s2">what I would suggest is if you were</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.929" end="01:17:44.639" style="s2">going to set up that structure the key</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.060" end="01:17:47.460" style="s2">thing you have to do is you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.639" end="01:17:49.500" style="s2">find the people who actually are going</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.460" end="01:17:51.449" style="s2">to run with the freedom and take it</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.500" end="01:17:54.119" style="s2">somewhere useful from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.449" end="01:17:55.949" style="s2">of students evergreen brought in people</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.119" end="01:17:57.270" style="s2">who you know it was very hard to figure</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.949" end="01:17:59.820" style="s2">out who was going to be good at the job</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.270" end="01:18:02.219" style="s2">of taking a blank canvas and turning it</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.820" end="01:18:03.929" style="s2">into some new educational environment so</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.219" end="01:18:05.790" style="s2">we got a lot of cruddy teachers but we</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.929" end="01:18:07.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a mechanism to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.790" end="01:18:10.020" style="s2">them and so they accumulated and what</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.980" end="01:18:12.449" style="s2">you want to do I think and we tried to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.020" end="01:18:15.900" style="s2">advocate for this for some years before</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.449" end="01:18:18.420" style="s2">the end was bring people in</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.900" end="01:18:20.849" style="s2">provisionally give them three years to</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.420" end="01:18:22.889" style="s2">figure out whether or not they can make</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.849" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">the structure or work and if they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.889" end="01:18:26.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not personal but they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be in those spots and if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.670" end="01:18:31.170" style="s2">accumulated people who inside of three</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:33.480" style="s2">years could figure out how to make the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.170" end="01:18:36.449" style="s2">most of that freedom you&#39;d have a great</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.480" end="01:18:38.670" style="s2">faculty and I mean that normally existed</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.449" end="01:18:39.989" style="s2">but in fact once you&#39;ve gotten hired to</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.670" end="01:18:42.570" style="s2">a tenure-track position you are almost</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.989" end="01:18:47.159" style="s2">guaranteed to get tenured yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.570" end="01:18:48.630" style="s2">true why is unity 2020 a better option</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.159" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">than pressuring our reps to pass</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.630" end="01:18:54.929" style="s2">anti-corruption legislation because you</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:56.940" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to pressure them because</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.929" end="01:18:59.219" style="s2">the people who have successfully</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.940" end="01:19:01.500" style="s2">corrupted the system will have vastly</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.219" end="01:19:03.929" style="s2">more resources with which to exert</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.500" end="01:19:06.060" style="s2">pressure in the other direction so the</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.929" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">reason to go after the White House is</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.060" end="01:19:12.989" style="s2">that it has the what&#39;s called the bully</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:16.889" style="s2">pulpit and the bully pulpit is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.989" end="01:19:22.230" style="s2">powerful position with which to to drive</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.889" end="01:19:23.940" style="s2">the money changers out as it were okay I</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.230" end="01:19:25.739" style="s2">said we do through her questions this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.940" end="01:19:27.210" style="s2">to be the last room but I just found one</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.739" end="01:19:28.860" style="s2">down below this on a totally different</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.210" end="01:19:29.659" style="s2">topic that we&#39;ll end with so get to more</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.860" end="01:19:31.880" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.659" end="01:19:33.650" style="s2">argued with a person who said all luff</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.880" end="01:19:36.709" style="s2">leaning people are parasites on humanity</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.650" end="01:19:38.389" style="s2">similar to Dawkins on religion how do we</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.709" end="01:19:40.689" style="s2">distinguish between evolved parasitic</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.389" end="01:19:43.809" style="s2">relationships versus evolved adaptations</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.689" end="01:19:47.809" style="s2">considering that both last a long time</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.809" end="01:19:49.909" style="s2">okay this is tough because the question</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.809" end="01:19:52.760" style="s2">is what level are you doing the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.909" end="01:19:54.590" style="s2">in other words parasites are adaptive if</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.760" end="01:19:59.050" style="s2">you analyze them at the parasite level</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.590" end="01:20:02.300" style="s2">right at the level of the host they are</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.050" end="01:20:04.519" style="s2">maladaptive so in some sense you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.300" end="01:20:06.769" style="s2">adaptive phenomena are those phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.519" end="01:20:11.989" style="s2">which are coherent and advanced their</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.769" end="01:20:14.479" style="s2">own interests now you can have mind</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.989" end="01:20:17.869" style="s2">virus stuff on a short timescale</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.479" end="01:20:20.300" style="s2">circulate in human culture and how are</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.869" end="01:20:22.639" style="s2">we to determine that well those</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.300" end="01:20:25.309" style="s2">strategies will be self-defeating over</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.639" end="01:20:27.739" style="s2">some period of time so for example to</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.309" end="01:20:30.139" style="s2">the extent that this ideology we are</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.739" end="01:20:32.360" style="s2">seeing in the street is very powerful it</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.139" end="01:20:34.070" style="s2">is not stable and so it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.360" end="01:20:35.449" style="s2">descend into a kind of madness you will</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.070" end="01:20:37.849" style="s2">notice that it will not produce the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.449" end="01:20:40.729" style="s2">Utopia it&#39;s proposing it will produce</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.849" end="01:20:43.159" style="s2">chaos right that tells us that it is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.729" end="01:20:45.019" style="s2">an adaptive structure short term it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.159" end="01:20:47.949" style="s2">gaining power but the structure it</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.019" end="01:20:51.650" style="s2">creates with that power is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.949" end="01:20:54.739" style="s2">authoritarian and it is going to produce</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.650" end="01:20:57.590" style="s2">vastly more injustice than the system it</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.739" end="01:21:01.760" style="s2">is replacing so you can take that as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.590" end="01:21:03.979" style="s2">prediction okay last question you said</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.760" end="01:21:05.989" style="s2">in Jamaica you studied reptiles I have</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.979" end="01:21:07.639" style="s2">tons of animals thriving in my garden</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.989" end="01:21:09.499" style="s2">any cool tips about these dewlap</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.639" end="01:21:10.880" style="s2">flashing guys you could share I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.499" end="01:21:12.769" style="s2">in the Caribbean there a case study for</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.880" end="01:21:13.699" style="s2">convergent evolution so I scrolled</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.769" end="01:21:17.269" style="s2">through and found the question about</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.699" end="01:21:20.449" style="s2">lizards inside yes well I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.269" end="01:21:22.699" style="s2">what I&#39;ll tell you a story so anyway I</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.449" end="01:21:24.919" style="s2">was working with Bob in Jamaica rivers</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.699" end="01:21:27.519" style="s2">Bob Traverse yeah the great evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.919" end="01:21:32.469" style="s2">biologist hi Bob if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.519" end="01:21:36.979" style="s2">anyway so we were capturing lizards and</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.469" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">we were counting things like scale</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.979" end="01:21:40.410" style="s2">number to see how symmetrical they were</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:43.200" style="s2">and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.410" end="01:21:47.550" style="s2">measuring basically there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.200" end="01:21:51.090" style="s2">of parasite load and desirability to</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.550" end="01:21:52.590" style="s2">mates right some males have this flag on</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.090" end="01:21:56.190" style="s2">their neck called a dewlap that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.590" end="01:21:58.140" style="s2">show and the they challenge each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.190" end="01:21:59.850" style="s2">you know you&#39;ll have one channel and one</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.140" end="01:22:01.260" style="s2">log and one animal and another log and</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.850" end="01:22:03.030" style="s2">they&#39;ll start flashing their dewlaps at</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.260" end="01:22:04.260" style="s2">each other and it&#39;s like game on and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.030" end="01:22:07.170" style="s2">they&#39;ll wrestle him do all these things</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.260" end="01:22:08.400" style="s2">and so anyway we were also we were</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.170" end="01:22:11.220" style="s2">taking the animals and we were measuring</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:12.990" style="s2">things about their symmetry and all of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.220" end="01:22:15.720" style="s2">that so I was very much in the habit so</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.990" end="01:22:17.400" style="s2">so sorry so you were you were engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.720" end="01:22:21.300" style="s2">the test of the Hamiltons up hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.400" end="01:22:23.100" style="s2">which is test that females are choosing</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.300" end="01:22:25.410" style="s2">males based on their low parasite load</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.100" end="01:22:26.850" style="s2">and their color in this case their</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.410" end="01:22:29.190" style="s2">brightness will be an indicator in</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.850" end="01:22:30.840" style="s2">inverse correlation with parasite load</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.190" end="01:22:32.670" style="s2">the brighter the lizards the lower the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.840" end="01:22:34.350" style="s2">parasite load but you were also testing</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.670" end="01:22:35.880" style="s2">questions of fluctuating asymmetry what</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.350" end="01:22:37.170" style="s2">about females were interested in</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.880" end="01:22:38.610" style="s2">particularly symmetrical like</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.170" end="01:22:40.440" style="s2">bilaterally symmetrical males right</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.610" end="01:22:42.300" style="s2">right thank you for the English English</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.440" end="01:22:44.940" style="s2">translation it was vastly clearer than</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.300" end="01:22:47.430" style="s2">what I was saying okay but anyway the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.940" end="01:22:49.620" style="s2">point was I was in the habit of grabbing</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.430" end="01:22:52.170" style="s2">lizards and inspecting them and one day</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.620" end="01:22:55.560" style="s2">I think Bob was getting ready to go out</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.170" end="01:23:00.060" style="s2">for the evening or something and I came</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.560" end="01:23:02.070" style="s2">into his room to talk to him and he</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.060" end="01:23:06.180" style="s2">pointed me to the fact that there was an</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.070" end="01:23:10.620" style="s2">animal on his dresser flashing its</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.180" end="01:23:14.130" style="s2">dewlap to itself in the mirror and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.620" end="01:23:17.100" style="s2">went to grab the anyone who&#39;s a at Dunn</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.130" end="01:23:19.890" style="s2">do that because in some sense this</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.100" end="01:23:22.500" style="s2">animal had come up against its ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.890" end="01:23:24.360" style="s2">Mac I mean no matter how the guy is so</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.500" end="01:23:26.190" style="s2">good he&#39;s so good so right and it would</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.360" end="01:23:29.400" style="s2">just like no matter how many decimal</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.190" end="01:23:32.130" style="s2">places you went they were dead even he</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.400" end="01:23:34.410" style="s2">seems to predict by every moment yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.130" end="01:23:36.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like that Marx Brothers routine</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.410" end="01:23:37.290" style="s2">from duck soup oh yeah the mirror one</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.660" end="01:23:40.740" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.290" end="01:23:42.600" style="s2">Beauty so anyway I did not collect the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.740" end="01:23:46.920" style="s2">lizard and we watched it for a good long</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.600" end="01:23:49.200" style="s2">time angrily falls off a dresser</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.920" end="01:23:49.930" style="s2">probably I did wonder briefly if it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.200" end="01:23:52.150" style="s2">gonna catch fire</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.930" end="01:23:55.030" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.150" end="01:23:57.190" style="s2">but anyway yeah so I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.030" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">there any tips other than yeah watch</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.190" end="01:24:02.080" style="s2">them they&#39;re fascinating creatures their</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:03.520" style="s2">fights are interesting oh I know I did</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.080" end="01:24:05.290" style="s2">one of the more interesting things I did</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.520" end="01:24:08.470" style="s2">while I was in Jamaica was I decided I</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.290" end="01:24:10.960" style="s2">was going to watch one animal for 24</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.470" end="01:24:15.250" style="s2">hours just to see what life looked like</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.960" end="01:24:16.450" style="s2">and it was fascinating so consistent I</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.250" end="01:24:18.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t know you did this 24 hours</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.450" end="01:24:20.650" style="s2">without you going to sleep well the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.520" end="01:24:22.180" style="s2">animal went to sleep it went a sleep I</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.650" end="01:24:23.470" style="s2">went to I went to bed took it because it</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.180" end="01:24:28.150" style="s2">was clear wasn&#39;t gonna move till sunrise</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.470" end="01:24:30.550" style="s2">so so anyway you know this was a male it</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.150" end="01:24:32.830" style="s2">had sex three times in 24 hours which I</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.550" end="01:24:34.600" style="s2">was very surprised by it so these</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.830" end="01:24:37.360" style="s2">animals have two penises one on each</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.600" end="01:24:39.070" style="s2">side and it alternated sides that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.360" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">it that&#39;s not one animal trait that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.070" end="01:24:42.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a squaw mate trip that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:45.370" style="s2">all snakes and lizards have that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.840" end="01:24:47.830" style="s2">but anyway the whole thing was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.370" end="01:24:49.180" style="s2">fascinating yes okay so you pulled those</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.830" end="01:24:51.010" style="s2">sort of a primatology move I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.180" end="01:24:52.450" style="s2">primatologists work really really hard</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.010" end="01:24:54.100" style="s2">because they basically have to put their</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.450" end="01:24:56.230" style="s2">monkeys if they&#39;re watching monkeys to</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.100" end="01:24:57.460" style="s2">bed at night and then get back before</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.230" end="01:24:59.740" style="s2">the monkeys get up in the morning and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.460" end="01:25:02.170" style="s2">start heading across the forest in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.740" end="01:25:03.610" style="s2">case you the the animal bedded down for</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.170" end="01:25:05.760" style="s2">the night and like where do they sleep</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.610" end="01:25:08.020" style="s2">what are they no hole in a hole okay and</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.760" end="01:25:09.100" style="s2">so a I&#39;d be curious if they go back to</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.020" end="01:25:11.860" style="s2">the same hole every night they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.100" end="01:25:13.330" style="s2">territorial mister did but when you came</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.860" end="01:25:14.650" style="s2">back the next morning presumably it was</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.330" end="01:25:16.000" style="s2">just was still in the hole and then you</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.650" end="01:25:17.200" style="s2">waited until it emerged and it did</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.000" end="01:25:17.710" style="s2">emerge and it was clear you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.200" end="01:25:19.720" style="s2">missed anything</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.710" end="01:25:21.490" style="s2">yep unless something fancy was going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.720" end="01:25:22.870" style="s2">inside the hole you never know you never</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.490" end="01:25:25.960" style="s2">know can that could have been a portal</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.870" end="01:25:27.100" style="s2">to another dimension oh yes all right I</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.960" end="01:25:28.780" style="s2">think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.100" end="01:25:32.710" style="s2">all right well thanks very much</p>
