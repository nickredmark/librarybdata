<p begin="00:02:11.800" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">a lot of things to talk about today but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:18.250" style="s2">why don&#39;t we start by talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">optimistic future of humanity and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.250" end="00:02:22.240" style="s2">we need to do to transition into that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:24.700" style="s2">future there are a lot of visions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.240" end="00:02:27.550" style="s2">theories out there about the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.700" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">macro system that we need to adopt not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.550" end="00:02:32.530" style="s2">only to survive the century but to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:34.660" style="s2">thrive what is your vision of that first</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.530" end="00:02:37.060" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t talk in terms of an ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.660" end="00:02:39.310" style="s2">system talk in terms of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:41.770" style="s2">evolution and so rather than kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.310" end="00:02:43.090" style="s2">utopian as one has previously thought of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.770" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">a perfected system we&#39;re going to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.090" end="00:02:48.970" style="s2">of a proto pian process right a process</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">of emergence into more elegantly ordered</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.970" end="00:02:53.320" style="s2">complexity that has more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">emergent properties and more of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.320" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">things we&#39;re interested in and gets over</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">some of the underlying causes of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.600" style="s2">we want to get past I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">rather than just iterative evolution we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.600" end="00:03:09.130" style="s2">are on the brink of a phase shift and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">phase shift defined by core axioms and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.130" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">core foundations of most of our macro</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:17.560" style="s2">global systems from our worldview to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:19.239" style="s2">economics to our governance to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.560" end="00:03:20.830" style="s2">infrastructure going through</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.239" end="00:03:23.709" style="s2">foundational shifts so this looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.830" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">step function in evolution where we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.709" end="00:03:28.660" style="s2">had capitalism that has gone through</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2">kind of iterative developmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.660" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">processes and we&#39;ve had representative</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">democracy that&#39;s gone through iterative</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">developmental processes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">scientific methodology and worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">etc now we are on the brink of something</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">that requires larger more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:49.480" style="s2">axiomatic and structural shift and so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:52.390" style="s2">can talk about what the criteria for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.480" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">other side of that have to look like for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.390" end="00:03:57.610" style="s2">it to be a non-self terminating system</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.370" end="00:04:00.730" style="s2">and for it to be a anti fragile system</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.610" end="00:04:03.549" style="s2">and those are two of the important</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.730" end="00:04:04.989" style="s2">criteria of any kind of world that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.549" end="00:04:07.209" style="s2">interesting for anyone right</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.989" end="00:04:09.340" style="s2">it is definitely non-self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.209" end="00:04:11.350" style="s2">and then not anti fragile then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.340" end="00:04:13.630" style="s2">more things we&#39;ll talk about on top of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.350" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">that so you want to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.630" end="00:04:18.789" style="s2">those criteria must be well sure but</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:20.500" style="s2">first let&#39;s define the problem so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.789" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">wrong with our current system and why do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.500" end="00:04:22.930" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">to transition out of it so when we say</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:27.729" style="s2">our current system we are sweeping a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:29.979" style="s2">of things together and it&#39;s worth kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.729" end="00:04:31.690" style="s2">of pulling those apart a bit we might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.979" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">talking about macroeconomics which</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.690" end="00:04:36.699" style="s2">obviously the macroeconomics of China</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:38.199" style="s2">and the macroeconomics of Russia the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.699" end="00:04:41.009" style="s2">macroeconomics of the United States if</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.199" end="00:04:45.550" style="s2">NATO are different systems but there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.009" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">kind of beyond national global economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.550" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">systems that we can we can look at we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.780" style="s2">can look at governance systems again</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:54.729" style="s2">national and then transnational</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.780" end="00:04:56.139" style="s2">governance and then beyond anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.729" end="00:04:58.659" style="s2">that&#39;s codified how human</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.139" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">decision-making works right we can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.659" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">of governance in the highest sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">how do we do collective decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:05.740" style="s2">at various scales from a business to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:08.259" style="s2">family to a nation to groups of Nations</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.740" end="00:05:09.569" style="s2">to a species as a whole navigating</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.259" end="00:05:11.470" style="s2">things that face the whole species</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.569" end="00:05:14.110" style="s2">economics we can think about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.470" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">do resource allocation and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.110" end="00:05:18.069" style="s2">human incentive systems with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:19.690" style="s2">infrastructure we can talk about how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.069" end="00:05:20.919" style="s2">we meet our physical needs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.690" end="00:05:23.650" style="s2">relationship with the physical planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.919" end="00:05:27.340" style="s2">right education medicines we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.650" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">of different systems that Co evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.340" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">they are interconnected and Entering and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:36.969" style="s2">then you can think of a you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">evolving paradigm that involves all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.969" end="00:05:41.310" style="s2">those things but we&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:44.710" style="s2">talk about at least the core ones in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.310" end="00:05:46.389" style="s2">distinction from each other so what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.710" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">the problem we&#39;re trying to fix well one</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.389" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">thing is those current systems the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:53.639" style="s2">interface of those current systems with</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.639" end="00:05:56.530" style="s2">each other and the net effects are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.639" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">unsustainable and unsustainable means</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.530" end="00:06:03.009" style="s2">self terminating means that these</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:05.469" style="s2">systems run to their own end and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.009" end="00:06:06.909" style="s2">fall off some kind of cliff right and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.469" end="00:06:09.069" style="s2">when we look at growth curves of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.909" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">different kinds of organisms anytime we</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.069" end="00:06:12.729" style="s2">see a growth curve that has an</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.080" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">they kill them fairly quickly the ones</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.200" end="00:14:07.570" style="s2">because they killed their host they</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.339" end="00:14:09.820" style="s2">don&#39;t live very long they don&#39;t get to</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.390" end="00:14:18.339" style="s2">propagate more and so there are a number</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.420" end="00:18:41.510" style="s2">the people to do their shitty jobs well</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.740" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">then the state has to force them and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.510" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">call that imperialism is why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:47.480" style="s2">like communism right or everyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">do an equal amount but that&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.480" end="00:18:50.809" style="s2">who is gonna enforce that state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.100" end="00:18:52.460" style="s2">important so capitalism says no no we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.809" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">let the free market enforce them right</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.460" end="00:18:56.150" style="s2">which is if they don&#39;t do the shitty</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">jobs they just go homeless that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.150" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">not freedom</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:03.170" style="s2">still it just moved the forcing function</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:05.000" style="s2">from the state to market right well as</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.170" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">we&#39;re moving into technological</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.000" end="00:19:12.050" style="s2">automation this foundational axiom of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">all economic theories which is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.050" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">deal with the labor economy right is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">this is an axiomatic topic is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:21.620" style="s2">obsoleted we&#39;re up sleeting that all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:25.160" style="s2">the conversations that Marx and Smith</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.620" end="00:19:28.309" style="s2">and friends had and so that both solves</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.160" end="00:19:31.370" style="s2">problems and it brings new ones so when</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.309" end="00:19:34.610" style="s2">we have technological automation that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.370" end="00:19:36.170" style="s2">capable of automating the shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.610" end="00:19:38.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to get when I say</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.170" end="00:19:39.230" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t mean that the machines</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.030" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">are going to take your jobs and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.230" end="00:19:42.549" style="s2">can&#39;t garden if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:43.899" style="s2">in garden or washer toilet if</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.549" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">you want to you just don&#39;t have to wash</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.899" end="00:19:46.720" style="s2">your toilet all the time because we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:49.240" style="s2">make bathrooms that clean themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:50.980" style="s2">better right and then if you just want</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.240" end="00:19:52.510" style="s2">to do that you&#39;re welcome to human</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.980" end="00:19:54.279" style="s2">freedom can absolutely do that if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.510" end="00:19:56.710" style="s2">want a garden you&#39;re welcome to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.279" end="00:19:59.260" style="s2">but can we create vertical agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.710" end="00:20:00.820" style="s2">systems that automate many aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.260" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">that while providing high-quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.820" end="00:20:05.500" style="s2">nutritious food with lower impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:07.960" style="s2">environment yes we can right and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.500" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">opens up more human freedom not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.960" end="00:20:12.039" style="s2">the other so as long as we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.059" end="00:20:13.630" style="s2">situation where the jobs need the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.039" end="00:20:16.059" style="s2">then we have to make it where the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.630" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">also need the jobs ie capitalism right</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.059" end="00:20:21.159" style="s2">which is why that system has you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:22.750" style="s2">succeeded in a Darwinian sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.159" end="00:20:25.990" style="s2">way that it has it&#39;s important to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.750" end="00:20:28.390" style="s2">that Darwinian selection does not select</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.990" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">for the true the good and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.390" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">right it selects for what is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:37.059" style="s2">which means what is dominant within</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:38.919" style="s2">scarcity dynamics now even if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.059" end="00:20:40.059" style="s2">gonna you know be going extinct in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.919" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">very near future because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.059" end="00:20:44.860" style="s2">forecasting it&#39;s not adequately</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:46.450" style="s2">forecasting right as soon as you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.860" end="00:20:49.059" style="s2">make it to where the jobs don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.450" end="00:20:50.230" style="s2">people the automation you can also make</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.059" end="00:20:52.059" style="s2">it where the people don&#39;t need the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:54.730" style="s2">which is what the Commonwealth economics</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.059" end="00:20:57.640" style="s2">is moving towards in a first step in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.730" end="00:20:59.470" style="s2">direction is the basic income basic</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.640" end="00:21:02.890" style="s2">income is not enough but it is a step</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.470" end="00:21:04.779" style="s2">and the key for it not to be a welfare</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.890" end="00:21:07.240" style="s2">system when we think about the problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.779" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">of the welfare system and how you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.240" end="00:21:11.260" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.179" style="s2">motive to create that capitalism gave</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.260" end="00:21:15.250" style="s2">them so they just sit on the couch and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.179" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">smoke crack all day those are people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.250" end="00:21:19.450" style="s2">that have already been broken this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.370" style="s2">very important point when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.450" end="00:21:24.429" style="s2">little children they&#39;re asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:25.059" style="s2">all day long why is fire hot why is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.429" end="00:21:26.860" style="s2">sky blue</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.059" end="00:21:28.630" style="s2">where do we go after we die where do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:30.789" style="s2">know they&#39;re fascinated asking deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.630" end="00:21:33.700" style="s2">philosophic and physics and you know etc</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.789" end="00:21:35.020" style="s2">questions and they want to help do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.700" end="00:21:37.870" style="s2">and they want to build stuff and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.020" end="00:21:39.429" style="s2">and then we don&#39;t answer those questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.870" end="00:21:40.990" style="s2">because why the is fire hot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.429" end="00:21:42.580" style="s2">actually a very deep physics question</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.990" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">and then it&#39;s moving from physics to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.580" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">consciousness studies let the mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">interface of subjective experience of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:49.960" style="s2">hotness with</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:53.620" style="s2">on the skin and nerve pathways and so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.960" end="00:21:56.590" style="s2">say I don&#39;t know spell cat and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.620" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">facilitate their interests while forcing</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.590" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">them to be interested in completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">uninteresting and thereby breaking</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:04.840" style="s2">their interest in life so then they just</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:06.730" style="s2">want to veg the out right and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.840" end="00:22:08.470" style="s2">now we have broken humans or if they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.730" end="00:22:10.900" style="s2">just veg out they will but this is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.470" end="00:22:13.150" style="s2">human nature this is broken humans in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.900" end="00:22:16.390" style="s2">system that systematically breaks humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.150" end="00:22:20.620" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very important to get that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.390" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">in this kind of economic system that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.620" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">we&#39;re proposing there&#39;s a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:24.700" style="s2">different education system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:27.100" style="s2">possible because we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.700" end="00:22:28.680" style="s2">prepare kids for the workforce and since</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.100" end="00:22:32.010" style="s2">we don&#39;t prepare them for the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.680" end="00:22:35.620" style="s2">the whole goal of education becomes</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.010" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">identifying the unique aptitude and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.620" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">interest and fascination and inclination</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:44.050" style="s2">of each child and facilitating the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:45.100" style="s2">out of it and realizing that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.050" end="00:22:47.320" style="s2">have to actually be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.100" end="00:22:48.460" style="s2">everything because we&#39;ve automated a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.320" end="00:22:51.460" style="s2">of things and then we&#39;ve shared a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.460" end="00:22:53.170" style="s2">things right but what they can uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.460" end="00:22:54.790" style="s2">do and what they can light up the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:56.860" style="s2">and uniquely doing and then have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.790" end="00:22:58.750" style="s2">benefit of that being fully available to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.860" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">everyone in a Commonwealth economics</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.750" end="00:23:03.100" style="s2">that makes radically more abundance</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">possible then for everyone then is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.100" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">actually possible for anyone in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:08.290" style="s2">system I&#39;ll come back to explaining how</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:10.060" style="s2">that&#39;s possible then that&#39;s the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.290" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">Education right facilitating the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.060" end="00:23:14.790" style="s2">emergence of radical uniqueness when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:17.470" style="s2">think about what is required in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.790" end="00:23:20.590" style="s2">post-birth sort of society I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.470" end="00:23:22.990" style="s2">call it I think people are optimizers so</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.590" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">it&#39;s more like picking the route or</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.990" end="00:23:26.710" style="s2">direction that they want to go to and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">then make that part of the system more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.710" end="00:23:30.940" style="s2">efficient over time like I myself do</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:32.920" style="s2">that with every aspect of our lives with</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.940" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">our website with you know I&#39;m like an</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.920" end="00:23:37.690" style="s2">efficiency optimizer no doubt people</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:38.770" style="s2">when they find what their calling is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.690" end="00:23:40.840" style="s2">what they want to be doing they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.770" end="00:23:43.450" style="s2">spend a lot of time doing exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.840" end="00:23:45.700" style="s2">in in the grander scale the way you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.450" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">the incentives are all out of whack yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.700" end="00:23:49.810" style="s2">D motivates them to learn which in turn</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:51.430" style="s2">D motivates them to optimize anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.810" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">which is exactly what this new system</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.430" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">needs and since you identify as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">optimizer</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:23:57.940" style="s2">then you think of it through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:23:59.140" style="s2">that they&#39;ll all be optimizing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">good lens</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.140" end="00:24:03.670" style="s2">someone else would say that they will</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:06.250" style="s2">all be creating yeah that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.670" end="00:24:08.280" style="s2">wow they map to each other there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.250" end="00:24:10.690" style="s2">both different experiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.280" end="00:24:12.070" style="s2">phenomenologically and they actually are</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.690" end="00:24:14.710" style="s2">different parts of the creative</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.070" end="00:24:18.250" style="s2">lifecycle and etc right different modes</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.710" end="00:24:20.170" style="s2">you also have some people who identify</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.220" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">largely these things that fit into</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.339" end="00:27:11.739" style="s2">the inability to make sense of almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.439" end="00:27:14.229" style="s2">anything that we&#39;re facing is how much</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.509" end="00:27:34.869" style="s2">a vested interest attached and so this</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.409" end="00:27:37.239" style="s2">is a very tricky process right where</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.869" end="00:27:40.029" style="s2">what we can actually believe in and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.239" end="00:27:42.489" style="s2">how much of music is geared towards what</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.029" end="00:27:44.949" style="s2">is going to have the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.489" end="00:27:46.599" style="s2">frames for me mobility so that it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.949" end="00:27:48.819" style="s2">get puppy enough to sell Pepsi or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.599" end="00:27:50.739" style="s2">whatever rather than what is actually</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.739" end="00:27:53.409" style="s2">create that other people&#39;s most</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.409" end="00:27:57.519" style="s2">think about what it means to create</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.699" end="00:28:02.289" style="s2">systems that remove all of those other</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.519" end="00:28:04.869" style="s2">agendas so that there are no vested</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.289" end="00:28:07.169" style="s2">interest agendas so now you know we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.869" end="00:28:09.429" style="s2">talked about that the criteria from</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.169" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">infrastructure what that had to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.429" end="00:28:13.469" style="s2">here&#39;s the criteria for social systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:15.339" style="s2">we said governance is decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.469" end="00:28:16.809" style="s2">economics is decision making an</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.339" end="00:28:19.779" style="s2">incentive but we just started to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.809" end="00:28:21.639" style="s2">hint at that the incentive moves from</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.779" end="00:28:24.069" style="s2">primarily extrinsic incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.639" end="00:28:25.959" style="s2">intrinsic incentive and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.069" end="00:28:26.419" style="s2">system that&#39;s all about facilitating in</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.959" end="00:28:29.090" style="s2">trend</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.419" end="00:28:31.070" style="s2">generative incentive right which D</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.090" end="00:28:33.739" style="s2">necessitates most of extrinsic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.070" end="00:28:35.029" style="s2">which becomes key then economics is</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.739" end="00:28:37.070" style="s2">largely about resource allocation</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.029" end="00:28:38.989" style="s2">systems optimization of resource</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.070" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">allocation towards all the various goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.989" end="00:28:42.710" style="s2">that matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">so most decision-making in you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.710" end="00:28:47.539" style="s2">governance is around resource decisions</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:48.889" style="s2">law is how do we make sure that those</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.539" end="00:28:50.359" style="s2">decisions actually get follow through so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.889" end="00:28:52.970" style="s2">we can actually think of economics as</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.359" end="00:28:55.609" style="s2">the heart of social systems right so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.970" end="00:28:57.379" style="s2">key criteria for the future of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.609" end="00:29:00.679" style="s2">macroeconomics is that all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.379" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">externalities get internalized meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.679" end="00:29:05.659" style="s2">everything that we affect by a decision</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">is factored in the decision making</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.659" end="00:29:12.019" style="s2">process and the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">resources get conferred to things so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.019" end="00:29:17.419" style="s2">another way to say this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:19.489" style="s2">agency the incentive of every agent</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.419" end="00:29:20.779" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a person or a group of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.489" end="00:29:23.119" style="s2">people called a company or a country</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.779" end="00:29:25.159" style="s2">even though I believe both of those two</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.119" end="00:29:27.529" style="s2">things will become obsolete just think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.159" end="00:29:30.259" style="s2">any person or group of people any agent</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.529" end="00:29:33.019" style="s2">the incentive of that agent has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.259" end="00:29:35.239" style="s2">perfectly aligned with the well-being of</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.609" end="00:29:43.549" style="s2">individual agents are incentivized to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.480" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">something that is external izing harm to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.549" end="00:29:47.119" style="s2">other agents of the Commons is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.070" style="s2">degree to which those problematic</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.470" end="00:29:56.090" style="s2">at scale because they are incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.090" end="00:29:58.039" style="s2">in decentralized fashion at scale that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.090" end="00:29:59.779" style="s2">the key of the future of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.039" end="00:30:02.600" style="s2">is the alignment of agency and</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.619" end="00:40:21.430" style="s2">to be surrounded by some people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.960" end="00:40:24.670" style="s2">have meaningfully better perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.430" end="00:40:27.519" style="s2">like Elon Musk and others so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.670" end="00:40:30.670" style="s2">there is influence potential there but</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.519" end="00:40:33.819" style="s2">we also see things like really seeking</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.819" end="00:40:41.559" style="s2">had crony capitalists ties for such a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.869" end="00:40:43.569" style="s2">long time and propose things like</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.569" end="00:40:48.700" style="s2">revolutionary revolutionary and in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.390" end="00:40:50.559" style="s2">good way and so it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.700" end="00:40:52.869" style="s2">see what could happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.559" end="00:40:55.239" style="s2">over the next time hear it here but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.869" end="00:40:56.589" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is let&#39;s let&#39;s look at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.239" end="00:40:58.599" style="s2">from a larger sense because similar</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.589" end="00:41:00.519" style="s2">things are happening in other places in</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.599" end="00:41:03.910" style="s2">the world right not just in politics but</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.519" end="00:41:07.029" style="s2">in the failure of several developed</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.910" end="00:41:10.569" style="s2">countries economic systems and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.029" end="00:41:12.219" style="s2">etc if you think about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.569" end="00:41:15.099" style="s2">systems theory and complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.219" end="00:41:17.859" style="s2">systems there&#39;s a kind of foundational</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.099" end="00:41:21.269" style="s2">principle that says complexity will</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.859" end="00:41:23.529" style="s2">evolve within any organizational system</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.269" end="00:41:25.269" style="s2">inexorably just because there&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.529" end="00:41:26.979" style="s2">and with movement there are self</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.269" end="00:41:29.160" style="s2">interacting dynamics and that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.979" end="00:41:32.279" style="s2">lead to increased complexity right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.160" end="00:41:34.390" style="s2">so complex is going to evolve within any</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.279" end="00:41:37.090" style="s2">organizational system until it actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.390" end="00:41:42.220" style="s2">exceeds that organization</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.090" end="00:41:43.540" style="s2">systems capacity to manage and when it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.220" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">exceeds it you&#39;re gonna start getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.540" end="00:41:48.220" style="s2">increased chaos and then increased</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:51.400" style="s2">entropy and then the dissolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.220" end="00:41:53.220" style="s2">organizational system and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.400" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">either going to get the entropic</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.220" end="00:42:00.190" style="s2">step-down to the previous level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:02.020" style="s2">organization or out of the chaos you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.190" end="00:42:04.120" style="s2">the emergence of a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.020" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">organization that isn&#39;t a retrofit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.120" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">the previous system but a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:13.140" style="s2">new kind of system that&#39;s a place that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:15.700" style="s2">globally I would say we&#39;re at we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.140" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">you know representative democracy is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.700" end="00:42:21.640" style="s2">just fundamentally not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">handling the kinds of collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.640" end="00:42:26.110" style="s2">decision-making we need to make right</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:29.230" style="s2">now when you think about the founding of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.110" end="00:42:32.110" style="s2">the United States and the time when</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.230" end="00:42:34.570" style="s2">people would get together in a town hall</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.110" end="00:42:36.310" style="s2">without representative decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.570" end="00:42:37.840" style="s2">right they get together and all vote on</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.310" end="00:42:40.900" style="s2">something and then someone would have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.840" end="00:42:42.550" style="s2">be represent the whole group who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.900" end="00:42:44.200" style="s2">ride a horse to where all the other town</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.550" end="00:42:45.430" style="s2">halls met to decide what the state did</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.200" end="00:42:46.540" style="s2">err it made sense to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.430" end="00:42:48.670" style="s2">representatives for very real</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.540" end="00:42:50.440" style="s2">technologic limits you know and there</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.670" end="00:42:52.120" style="s2">were other reasons that were argued but</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.440" end="00:42:54.550" style="s2">that was a part of the etiology of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.120" end="00:42:55.930" style="s2">whole thing right and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.550" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have a town hall big enough for</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.930" end="00:42:59.800" style="s2">the whole population and so we have an</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.800" end="00:43:04.060" style="s2">Town Hall beginning for the whole</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.670" end="00:46:23.590" style="s2">what kind of things can we do as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:26.810" style="s2">civilization to kind of aid in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.590" end="00:46:29.750" style="s2">midwifery process to allow for this baby</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">do it in ways that can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:42.590" style="s2">scalability are things worth looking at</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.220" end="00:46:47.630" style="s2">so if you think about infrastructure the</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.630" end="00:46:52.010" style="s2">management manufacturing to a</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.010" end="00:46:57.310" style="s2">thinking about could we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:47:00.830" style="s2">decentralized systems of 3d 4d printing</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.310" end="00:47:02.810" style="s2">with modular upgradability built in</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.700" end="00:47:13.160" style="s2">then have them connected to recycling</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.940" end="00:47:14.840" style="s2">systems that move to lower entropy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.160" end="00:47:17.570" style="s2">higher efficiency moving eventually</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.840" end="00:47:19.880" style="s2">towards things like atomic sorting where</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.570" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">then the old things get to be brought</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:24.890" style="s2">back into the individual parts to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:27.890" style="s2">new things all run on renewable energy</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.890" end="00:47:30.830" style="s2">sources low toxicity low entropy</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:32.750" style="s2">renewable energy sources on the biologic</p>

<p begin="00:47:35.960" end="00:47:39.890" style="s2">as part of the you know creative</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.609" end="00:47:41.810" style="s2">materials process and then the waste</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.810" end="00:47:46.340" style="s2">involves anaerobic digestion algae</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.670" end="00:47:48.320" style="s2">scrubbers etc and so there is no waste</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.340" end="00:47:49.670" style="s2">there is no raw material sourcing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.320" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">isn&#39;t part of that closely building</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.670" end="00:47:54.260" style="s2">those systems and not just individual</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:56.330" style="s2">technologies but those but the Guild&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.260" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">ecosystems of those technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.330" end="00:48:02.510" style="s2">lead to closed-loop sustainability of</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.510" end="00:48:07.880" style="s2">those systems that is stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.970" end="00:48:09.830" style="s2">worth building so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:12.020" style="s2">building the future of our social</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.830" end="00:48:15.109" style="s2">systems and knowing that the goal of our</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.270" end="00:48:21.230" style="s2">of other agents in the comments start</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.250" end="00:48:23.750" style="s2">thinking about how to close the</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.750" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">the externality gap then building ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.830" end="00:48:32.750" style="s2">to measure externalities and just see</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:34.040" style="s2">them to then be able to quantify them</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.750" end="00:48:36.140" style="s2">and internalize them those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.040" end="00:48:38.330" style="s2">technologies worth building right to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.140" end="00:48:40.220" style="s2">able to build a balance sheet of the</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.270" end="00:48:54.380" style="s2">Commons right so then we can see where</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.980" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">the Commons are increasing and their</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.380" end="00:48:58.190" style="s2">resilience versus decreasing where</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.190" end="00:49:02.330" style="s2">you know players are involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.930" end="00:49:03.460" style="s2">and you know how to really quantify it</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.330" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">those are things that should happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.460" end="00:49:08.450" style="s2">starting to move towards things like</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.450" end="00:49:14.810" style="s2">that does allow the ability to have</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.810" end="00:49:17.780" style="s2">really start to emerge and then looking</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.710" end="00:50:13.580" style="s2">in a situation where there&#39;s a finite</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.600" end="00:50:17.630" style="s2">amount of stuff and the less of it there</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.580" end="00:50:19.430" style="s2">is the more value is added to it but not</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.630" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">real utility value right like even</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.430" end="00:50:24.050" style="s2">though gold has some real utility value</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.109" end="00:50:25.670" style="s2">as a as a conductor as a reflector we</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.050" end="00:50:27.080" style="s2">don&#39;t use it for its utility value we</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.670" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">put it in bars and put it in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.080" end="00:50:31.260" style="s2">where nobody really uses it for anything</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:35.820" style="s2">based on its scarcity but we will damage</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.750" end="00:50:37.110" style="s2">ecosystems that are actually supporting</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.330" end="00:50:53.640" style="s2">so how to have a real valuation system</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.060" end="00:50:56.220" style="s2">that is valuing proportional to real</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.640" end="00:50:57.840" style="s2">value rather than you know nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.220" end="00:50:59.160" style="s2">value that&#39;s about differential</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.840" end="00:51:01.500" style="s2">advantage in competitive systems so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.160" end="00:51:02.730" style="s2">building those valuation systems you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.500" end="00:51:04.560" style="s2">know those are the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.730" end="00:51:07.320" style="s2">need to happen building the blockchain</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.380" end="00:52:26.220" style="s2">that means pain that isn&#39;t filled with</p>

<p begin="00:52:45.819" end="00:52:49.509" style="s2">way that is conditioning off the moment</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.170" end="00:53:11.829" style="s2">loops and don&#39;t just support something</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:14.650" style="s2">being better within a self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.829" end="00:53:18.219" style="s2">system but support the infrastructure</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.329" end="00:53:29.950" style="s2">positive and sustainable future it seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.999" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">like from your framework closing loops</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.950" end="00:53:33.729" style="s2">is the big answer and they can close</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:35.710" style="s2">loops in any number of industries but</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.729" end="00:53:37.420" style="s2">what would you add to that the fact of</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.420" end="00:53:42.099" style="s2">something I would have them look at if</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.099" end="00:53:49.150" style="s2">on to have their life be of greatest</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.619" end="00:53:50.890" style="s2">value to life it&#39;s a great care and if</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.150" end="00:53:53.079" style="s2">they understand you as people who have</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.079" end="00:53:58.299" style="s2">getting input is valuable to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.349" end="00:53:59.710" style="s2">though that they are seeing US</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.299" end="00:54:00.999" style="s2">authorities and they&#39;re looking for an</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.710" end="00:54:02.200" style="s2">external authority to give them the</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.200" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">that thinking itself is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.299" end="00:54:09.190" style="s2">things they have to overcome and if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">think about the way most people have</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.190" end="00:54:15.279" style="s2">been raised as children we very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:18.819" style="s2">got punished for doing what that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.279" end="00:54:20.499" style="s2">authorities wanted us to do and most all</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.819" end="00:54:22.539" style="s2">of the times we got punished or for</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.499" end="00:54:25.420" style="s2">doing things that we wanted to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.539" end="00:54:29.529" style="s2">maybe appeal to our own sensibilities or</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.420" end="00:54:31.779" style="s2">desires intuitions feelings and most of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.529" end="00:54:33.369" style="s2">the time that we got praised and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.779" end="00:54:35.880" style="s2">rewarded was for doing things the</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.880" end="00:54:39.999" style="s2">you know we&#39;re at least aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.960" end="00:54:41.710" style="s2">what they figured what we figured from</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.999" end="00:54:43.719" style="s2">previous expressions they probably want</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.710" end="00:54:45.009" style="s2">us to do and so this is a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.719" end="00:54:48.759" style="s2">conditioning when we are most</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.009" end="00:54:52.119" style="s2">susceptible to conditioning to look to</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.470" end="00:54:58.990" style="s2">you know authorities to tell us how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.840" end="00:55:00.670" style="s2">live our lives and when we touched our</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.990" end="00:55:02.170" style="s2">bodies we found that the parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.670" end="00:55:03.640" style="s2">bodies that fell best to touch with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.170" end="00:55:04.060" style="s2">parts that we got most in trouble for</p>

<p begin="00:55:04.060" end="00:55:10.450" style="s2">so obviously what feels good to us is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.960" end="00:55:12.849" style="s2">bad so we can&#39;t trust our feelings but</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.450" end="00:55:14.290" style="s2">the authorities know that it&#39;s bad so we</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.849" end="00:55:17.260" style="s2">can apparently trust the authorities but</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.290" end="00:55:19.690" style="s2">not our feelings and no one has ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.260" end="00:55:22.810" style="s2">really interested in our thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.690" end="00:55:24.280" style="s2">perspectives they were pre defined right</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.810" end="00:55:25.990" style="s2">answers to things and we got praised</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.280" end="00:55:28.119" style="s2">when we got them and we got in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.990" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t get them and people were</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.700" end="00:55:38.200" style="s2">that were someone else&#39;s design ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.349" end="00:55:41.410" style="s2">and so we got conditioned very deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.200" end="00:55:44.320" style="s2">that system that is part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.410" end="00:55:48.910" style="s2">that is self terminating because most</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.910" end="00:55:55.060" style="s2">causing more net harm to the world than</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.910" end="00:55:57.550" style="s2">benefit that they don&#39;t actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.060" end="00:55:59.800" style="s2">good about but they do not trust their</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.550" end="00:56:01.450" style="s2">own feeling or believe that they can do</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.800" end="00:56:03.130" style="s2">something else or know how to actually</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.130" end="00:56:08.680" style="s2">themselves enough to self assess or self</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.990" end="00:56:11.230" style="s2">initiate and most people when they look</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.230" end="00:56:16.420" style="s2">actually feel really not okay with much</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.170" end="00:56:18.280" style="s2">of the way the world is in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.420" end="00:56:20.230" style="s2">come actually from love in them they</p>

<p begin="00:56:20.230" end="00:56:25.270" style="s2">expressed as anger or jaded Ness but</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.140" end="00:56:28.510" style="s2">they don&#39;t believe in their own ability</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.270" end="00:56:31.030" style="s2">to find solutions to figure out so</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.510" end="00:56:33.369" style="s2">they just numb out name them out on</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.030" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">alcohol or on TV or whatever they do and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.369" end="00:56:38.920" style="s2">so when you look at the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.210" style="s2">ever meaningfully moved the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.920" end="00:56:41.980" style="s2">forward where they solved some problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.210" end="00:56:43.750" style="s2">that had not been solved it really</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.980" end="00:56:45.460" style="s2">needed to be solved nobody taught them</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.750" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">how to do it because no one cooks the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.460" end="00:56:48.700" style="s2">problem wasn&#39;t solved yet nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.589" style="s2">have taught Edison how to make a light</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.700" end="00:56:53.470" style="s2">bulb nobody could have told Gandhi how</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.589" end="00:56:54.910" style="s2">to get home roll for India and one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.470" end="00:56:57.849" style="s2">the fascinating things was that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.910" end="00:56:59.589" style="s2">decided to do it because they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.849" end="00:57:03.790" style="s2">it was important before having any idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.589" end="00:57:06.310" style="s2">how to do it and then they trusted in</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.790" end="00:57:06.580" style="s2">both the rightness of it enough and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.310" end="00:57:09.490" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.580" end="00:57:11.800" style="s2">capability to learn enough to really</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.490" end="00:57:13.960" style="s2">apply themselves deeply and to continue</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.800" end="00:57:17.500" style="s2">through all of the early not successes</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.960" end="00:57:20.290" style="s2">until they found stuff so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.500" end="00:57:22.540" style="s2">encourage young people to do is to take</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.290" end="00:57:25.570" style="s2">profound responsibility for their</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.540" end="00:57:27.730" style="s2">existence and to know that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.570" end="00:57:29.260" style="s2">lot of people in a lot of books and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.730" end="00:57:32.620" style="s2">lot of courses that have valuable should</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.260" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">to teach them but if an adequate answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.620" end="00:57:35.590" style="s2">to what they should do with their life</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:38.380" style="s2">existed anywhere that whole thing would</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.590" end="00:57:40.060" style="s2">be done already and the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.380" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">things aren&#39;t done means that all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.060" end="00:57:43.810" style="s2">best teachers and thinkers have not got</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.920" end="00:57:45.190" style="s2">it yet right they have ideas they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.810" end="00:57:48.370" style="s2">things to learn you should absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.190" end="00:57:50.200" style="s2">learn from them and you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.370" end="00:57:51.730" style="s2">something to add not only in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.200" end="00:57:55.240" style="s2">your work but also in terms of your</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.730" end="00:57:58.300" style="s2">creativity so I would say look around at</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.240" end="00:58:03.400" style="s2">the world and see all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.300" end="00:58:05.260" style="s2">really bother you and realize that them</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.400" end="00:58:07.600" style="s2">bothering you as part of your guidance</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.260" end="00:58:09.310" style="s2">and see all the things that you really</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.600" end="00:58:11.020" style="s2">love all the things that are beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.310" end="00:58:13.090" style="s2">and you realize they&#39;re connected right</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.020" end="00:58:15.340" style="s2">animals are beautiful and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.090" end="00:58:17.080" style="s2">the devastation of animals and their</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.340" end="00:58:18.490" style="s2">habitat is really bothersome people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.080" end="00:58:20.560" style="s2">beautiful so homelessness and or</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.490" end="00:58:23.080" style="s2">bothersome right you children are</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.560" end="00:58:26.230" style="s2">beautiful so bad education systems are</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.080" end="00:58:29.170" style="s2">bothersome so look at what you love look</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.230" end="00:58:32.710" style="s2">at how what you love is not well</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.170" end="00:58:35.530" style="s2">supported in various areas and realize</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.710" end="00:58:37.450" style="s2">that it does not have to be that way any</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.530" end="00:58:40.840" style="s2">more than the world had to stay dark in</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.450" end="00:58:43.000" style="s2">the time of Edison and yet for all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.840" end="00:58:44.710" style="s2">human history before Edison it did right</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.000" end="00:58:46.660" style="s2">and taking on something that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.710" end="00:58:50.110" style="s2">impossible literally delivered the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.660" end="00:58:52.960" style="s2">from darkness in that way right and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.110" end="00:58:54.910" style="s2">study the out of the topic right</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.960" end="00:58:56.350" style="s2">without thinking that a completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.910" end="00:58:57.850" style="s2">adequate solution is there so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.350" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">probably a lot of partially good</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.850" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">solutions maybe a technology that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:03.250" style="s2">totally good technology but it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.910" end="00:59:05.170" style="s2">market feasibility hasn&#39;t came about yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.250" end="00:59:06.850" style="s2">or the way to bring the meme out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.170" end="00:59:09.100" style="s2">or parts of the ideas are there but they</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.850" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">need synthesized or whatever it is study</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.100" end="00:59:13.300" style="s2">is a problem well study what an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:15.100" style="s2">solution would look like gain a real</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.300" end="00:59:17.380" style="s2">clear inside of what adequate solution</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.100" end="00:59:18.970" style="s2">looks like in your own area of what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.380" end="00:59:22.390" style="s2">care to contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.970" end="00:59:23.890" style="s2">as things emerged that you feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.390" end="00:59:27.250" style="s2">can contribute to as you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.890" end="00:59:30.790" style="s2">about it contribute to them and continue</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.250" end="00:59:33.070" style="s2">to assess on your own and initiate on</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.790" end="00:59:35.530" style="s2">your own with of course good input from</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.070" end="00:59:37.480" style="s2">all the places of good input that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.530" end="00:59:40.570" style="s2">key thing I would say take really deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.480" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">responsibility for the impact that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.570" end="00:59:44.440" style="s2">have in your life while you&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:45.850" style="s2">then all of the study all the training</p>
