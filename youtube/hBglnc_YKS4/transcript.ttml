<p begin="00:00:03.620" end="00:00:08.639" style="s2">so I hope this is going to be the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.970" end="00:00:10.230" style="s2">film about the London real situation I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:12.210" style="s2">much prefer be making films about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">wider issues raised by it kind of free</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.210" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">speech censorship but it is such a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">story and I feel that it&#39;s worth ruining</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">it off and I thought the best way to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">that would be to have a dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">coffee Zilla so coffee Zilla is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">American youtuber who&#39;s also been</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">following the story so I want to play</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">the whole conversation and in it we</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">talked about the recent meltdown on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:37.290" style="s2">YouTube and how the London real army</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">seems to be turning against Brian Rose I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine a bigger trainwreck with</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">your audience because basically he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">getting all these questions all this</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">pressure and it&#39;s like one day he just</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">snapped</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">he&#39;s cursing at his audience calling</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">them fools it was insane it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">absolutely insane I&#39;ve never seen a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">meltdown quite like this and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">waiting for it to be deleted and it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">up for at least 24 hours and just to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">clear it was deleted eventually yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:06.090" style="s2">also the central question of whether the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">entire fundraising scheme makes any</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.090" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">sense at all it&#39;s the it&#39;s the funniest</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">thing in the world to me because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">makes zero sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">as soon as Brian rose said that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">like okay your whole thing makes zero</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">since you&#39;ve raised all this money for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">nothing other than yourself and your own</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">ego about having your own platform so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna record an update to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2">London real investigation London real</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">situation I&#39;m joined by coffee Zilla</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">who&#39;s been doing his own follow ups on</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">the London real situation thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">travelling coffee Zilla Steven Steven</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">I&#39;ll say Steven from now on and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">think both of us we&#39;ve talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:44.780" style="s2">bit offline before recording this and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">think both of us feel a little bit torn</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.780" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">like we don&#39;t want to keep returning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">this story but it&#39;s also such a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">story I&#39;d spend a bit of time just kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:56.450" style="s2">of unpacking some of the the wider</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">issues what we&#39;ve we&#39;ve both been</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.450" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">contacted by other people who&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">knowledge of the situation there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">of stuff that&#39;s been going on I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">it&#39;s worth unpacking and revealing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">people and also just some of the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolutely compelling story just</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:14.340" style="s2">to see it unfolding in real time just</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.330" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">before we kind of get into the detail</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.340" end="00:02:18.690" style="s2">where are you at with it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">I&#39;m where you are I&#39;m sort of tired of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.690" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">this piece but also I can&#39;t stop looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a horrible car crash or</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">something like that full disclosure I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:28.890" style="s2">what I was watching landed real before</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:30.390" style="s2">this whole thing happened and I saw his</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.890" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">content it was going in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">direction and I feel like I felt and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">lot of people felt that recently he has</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.390" style="s2">completely shifted into a new direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">and there are a lot of questions about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">you know this fundraising he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">doing how transparent he&#39;s been and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">I feel like at this point I&#39;m so far in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:53.130" style="s2">that I I have to at least wrap the bow</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2">tie the bow whatever before letting this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.130" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">thing go finally yeah I feel similarly</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying I mean I was primarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:03.600" style="s2">interested in it for the wider issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">that it put put out there free speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.600" end="00:03:09.390" style="s2">censorship but the weaponization of free</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">speech is just a huge in huge thing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.390" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">well like playing the censorship cloud</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">playing the free speech card and for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">I feel that those are such powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:20.940" style="s2">cards and such important cards that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to be kind of very aware and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.940" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">very careful about kind of how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:26.880" style="s2">used and how that can be abused and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.530" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">think just to bring people up to date</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.880" end="00:03:31.020" style="s2">there has been something of a backlash</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">which we&#39;ll get to soon like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.020" end="00:03:34.770" style="s2">audience his own audience people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">donated money especially have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.770" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">been asking some pretty tough questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">and also there&#39;s another angle that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">you&#39;re much more familiar with than I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:45.390" style="s2">which is other sort of business</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">practices he&#39;s brought in this five</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.390" end="00:03:49.830" style="s2">coins to five million with with ticket</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">akari</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">ticket owari tickity Tiwari tiga Tiwari</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:58.020" style="s2">and another another business guy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:03:59.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve actually focused really</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.020" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">carefully on that in a lot of the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.670" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">films that you&#39;ve put out yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like a it&#39;s it&#39;s a massive question</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:10.590" style="s2">a massive problem when you have someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">you know raising raising all these funds</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.590" end="00:04:14.070" style="s2">for in the name of freedom but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:15.660" style="s2">collecting all these emails also getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.070" end="00:04:17.520" style="s2">all this attention and saying like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:19.920" style="s2">the guy that you guys can trust to give</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.520" end="00:04:22.710" style="s2">you the truth but then you&#39;re selling</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.920" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">some crypto what I characterizes a scam</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.710" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">and that becomes all of a sudden a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">problem I I think what you said is true</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:29.129" style="s2">weapon</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:32.099" style="s2">freedom of speech because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.129" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">powerful motivator it&#39;s of course a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.099" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">universal human value so when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:37.110" style="s2">hey I&#39;m the freedom of speech guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:38.909" style="s2">gonna say no to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:42.599" style="s2">right like everybody is a freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.909" end="00:04:45.810" style="s2">speech guy almost so so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.599" end="00:04:48.840" style="s2">important to say that look I don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.810" end="00:04:51.330" style="s2">with YouTube&#39;s you know censorship here</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.840" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">I said that from day one of even about</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.330" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">David Icke day one I said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:56.099" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe with them just taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:04:58.319" style="s2">him down I think there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.099" end="00:05:00.449" style="s2">broader discussion but what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.319" end="00:05:02.370" style="s2">is he&#39;s weaponized that and turned it</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.449" end="00:05:04.199" style="s2">into let me fundraise four million</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.370" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">dollars because I&#39;m the guy that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.199" end="00:05:08.129" style="s2">protect free speech and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">simply not the truth yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.129" end="00:05:12.530" style="s2">the thing that sort of sent me over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:15.569" style="s2">edge to record something else was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.530" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">declaration that he put out and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.569" end="00:05:18.840" style="s2">seems to have pushed a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.909" style="s2">over the edge well one thing is that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">said he was going to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.909" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">crowdfunding at a million and then he</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:28.439" style="s2">started rate trying to raise another 250</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.779" style="s2">thousand a month so an extra three</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.439" end="00:05:33.110" style="s2">million and then it was this declaration</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.779" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">that got put out which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.110" end="00:05:38.490" style="s2">sign here and we want to get a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:40.020" style="s2">thousand signatures of course you have</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.020" end="00:05:46.409" style="s2">and why that really so within that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.830" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">also framing himself as like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.409" end="00:05:49.379" style="s2">thing is centered on him I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">battling for free speech they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.379" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">doing this to me it&#39;s all about me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:57.270" style="s2">like and what kind of pushed me over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:06:01.409" style="s2">edge was that in the UK we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.270" end="00:06:03.629" style="s2">a petition that we have a function</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.409" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">whether if you get 10,000 signatures on</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.629" end="00:06:07.080" style="s2">this petition it will be considered to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:10.139" style="s2">be debated a hundred thousand signatures</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.080" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">it will be possibly debated in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.139" end="00:06:14.190" style="s2">Parliament so there&#39;s actually a way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s an ethical way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.190" end="00:06:17.669" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re giving someone your</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:20.219" style="s2">email address that they&#39;re then using it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.669" end="00:06:21.960" style="s2">to market to you so that just that kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.219" end="00:06:25.349" style="s2">of pushed me over the edge of just kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.960" end="00:06:27.719" style="s2">of transparent email harvesting in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.349" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">name of this kind of what like like</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.719" end="00:06:30.779" style="s2">genuine I think is a sacred value I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:35.219" style="s2">think this is a sacred value and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.779" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">really yeah I feel I feel very energized</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.219" end="00:06:41.009" style="s2">by when when that is is weaponized and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:42.749" style="s2">then it gets caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.009" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in we&#39;re in a struggle with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.749" end="00:06:45.270" style="s2">tech platforms a lot of us feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">we&#39;re in a struggle with the tech</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.270" end="00:06:48.749" style="s2">platforms we&#39;re worried about being</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.580" end="00:06:50.339" style="s2">demonetised were worried about worrying</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.749" end="00:06:53.279" style="s2">about we&#39;re worried about having some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.339" end="00:06:56.249" style="s2">our stuff taken down so I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.279" end="00:06:57.649" style="s2">got a basically clean house we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.249" end="00:07:00.930" style="s2">kind of call out the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.649" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">using those really powerful arguments</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.930" end="00:07:04.889" style="s2">for their own benefits</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:06.569" style="s2">yeah for sure I think the question here</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.889" end="00:07:07.949" style="s2">is what&#39;s the intention behind the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.569" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">digital freedom platform I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.949" end="00:07:11.849" style="s2">a large question I mean whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:14.009" style="s2">spending the money poorly or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.849" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">what are Brian roses intentions because</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.009" end="00:07:17.819" style="s2">for a long time he&#39;s been saying oh I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:19.620" style="s2">just care about free speech I just care</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.819" end="00:07:22.439" style="s2">about this I&#39;m being silenced bubble</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.620" end="00:07:23.999" style="s2">over one thing I brought sort of to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.439" end="00:07:25.889" style="s2">light though in one of my recent videos</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.999" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">is that Brian roses channel has never</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.889" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">been doing better</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.689" style="s2">he has seized an opportunity and his</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:32.009" style="s2">views went like this he was like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.689" end="00:07:33.629" style="s2">stagnant and then all of a sudden he</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.009" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">starts talking about censorship he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.629" end="00:07:37.949" style="s2">like this in terms of views in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.430" end="00:07:40.559" style="s2">subscribers in terms of people backing</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.949" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">him in terms of donations in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.559" end="00:07:44.699" style="s2">people for his email list in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">his own audience pool within his</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.699" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">audience that was already there all of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:50.219" style="s2">sudden they care a lot more and so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">have to wonder with each thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.219" end="00:07:54.959" style="s2">doing is he doing it because he wants</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:56.969" style="s2">freedom of speech or is he capitalizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.959" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">on what could be characterized as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.969" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">extremely lucrative situation yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:06.839" style="s2">let&#39;s recap I mentioned a few things in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:10.469" style="s2">that little spiel before one of which</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.839" end="00:08:11.849" style="s2">was the the fact that he supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.469" end="00:08:13.349" style="s2">raised a million it&#39;s hard to know</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.849" end="00:08:15.899" style="s2">because that the counter was actually on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.349" end="00:08:17.519" style="s2">the London real site I was skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.899" end="00:08:19.589" style="s2">that he actually had but you you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.519" end="00:08:21.629" style="s2">that he may well have done which I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.589" end="00:08:23.309" style="s2">is worth unpacking in itself but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.629" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">what happened next cuz then there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.309" end="00:08:29.099" style="s2">this stage 6 or phase 6 money-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:31.259" style="s2">thing which was we need 250,000 a month</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.099" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">to keep this thing running yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.259" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">it&#39;s worth going back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s all happened so that now if</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:39.870" style="s2">you weren&#39;t present for each subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:42.060" style="s2">stage you could think oh it was always</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.870" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">planned out to be forfeit six phases and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.060" end="00:08:45.990" style="s2">this is one of my biggest criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">lended reel so it started with phase one</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.990" end="00:08:50.579" style="s2">oh I&#39;m gonna livestream a million people</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.380" style="s2">then right after he reaches his goal all</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.579" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">of a sudden he introduces phase two and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.380" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">three he didn&#39;t even have four or five</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">and four or five</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:09:00.420" style="s2">six yet that&#39;s all came on later so then</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:02.310" style="s2">he goes okay all I&#39;m raising for is now</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.420" end="00:09:04.170" style="s2">more controversial voices and blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.310" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">where he got blockchain from nobody</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.170" end="00:09:07.829" style="s2">knows cuz nobody really understands why</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary it&#39;s not so then he</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.829" end="00:09:12.300" style="s2">raises that money then he goes okay well</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">now I need to raise more money and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.300" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">the logic there was that okay David give</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">me money because really the intention is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">just to fundraise to the end of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">fundraising date and then I&#39;m shutting</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:24.180" style="s2">it off the only you know rationale for</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">putting more and more stretch goals was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.180" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">always well we&#39;re just gonna continue</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:30.149" style="s2">fundraising continue taking your money</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.410" style="s2">until we go to the fundraising date that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.149" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">was always the plan that was the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.410" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">rationale for creating nine hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:37.050" style="s2">thousand dollars in stretch goals I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:38.910" style="s2">everyone to remember a hundred dollars</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.050" end="00:09:40.260" style="s2">and he said repeatedly that that would</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.910" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">be the end let&#39;s just play it play a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.260" end="00:09:43.769" style="s2">clip where he says that this is gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.029" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">on for another ten days until Rose Ike</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.769" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">and we&#39;re shutting off we&#39;re we gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:49.050" style="s2">closing down this fundraising campaign</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:51.660" style="s2">very soon so again we&#39;re closing this</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.050" end="00:09:53.490" style="s2">thing out on May third perfect and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.660" end="00:09:55.079" style="s2">all of a sudden the fundraising ends he</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.490" end="00:09:56.820" style="s2">raises over million dollars I believe he</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.079" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">did I believe he did and I&#39;ll explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:01.050" style="s2">that in a second but then he all of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:03.420" style="s2">sudden moves on without missing a beat</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.050" end="00:10:05.490" style="s2">without any kind of explanation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.420" end="00:10:08.250" style="s2">okay well now we need running costs and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.490" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">he hikes up the price to another three</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.250" end="00:10:11.550" style="s2">million dollars over the calendar year</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:13.230" style="s2">but why I think he actually raised the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.550" end="00:10:16.380" style="s2">money because it doesn&#39;t make sense for</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.230" end="00:10:17.820" style="s2">him to put I think the donation fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.380" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">that it creates in your audience when</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.820" end="00:10:22.890" style="s2">you if you lied about raising a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2">dollars is not worth the press of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.890" end="00:10:26.339" style="s2">raising a million dollars like who wants</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:28.140" style="s2">to raise who wants to donate to a guy</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.339" end="00:10:31.529" style="s2">who&#39;s already has a million dollars like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.140" end="00:10:33.420" style="s2">nobody so I think of anything if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.529" end="00:10:37.199" style="s2">were to lie about a donation you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.420" end="00:10:39.779" style="s2">probably under underrepresented but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.199" end="00:10:42.029" style="s2">just generally think I don&#39;t know one</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.779" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">way or the other I think it just if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.029" end="00:10:46.920" style="s2">just think in terms of rational actors</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:50.250" style="s2">he probably didn&#39;t lie about it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.920" end="00:10:53.639" style="s2">mean I think it&#39;s worth digging into</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.250" end="00:10:55.319" style="s2">that because my sense was that the that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.639" end="00:10:57.060" style="s2">he probably didn&#39;t raise a million I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.319" end="00:10:58.319" style="s2">mean that the count was on his website</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.060" end="00:11:00.899" style="s2">it was hard to verify there was no</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.319" end="00:11:03.300" style="s2">verification but you&#39;ve looked at these</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.899" end="00:11:05.819" style="s2">kind of tactics before and you fit you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.300" end="00:11:07.050" style="s2">think that people have raised that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.819" end="00:11:07.980" style="s2">of money doing this kind of thing before</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.050" end="00:11:09.660" style="s2">is that without</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.980" end="00:11:11.520" style="s2">be fair summary oh yeah if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.660" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">skepticism is a million dollars it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.520" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">lot of money fear not because the the</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.620" end="00:15:34.470" style="s2">is this is kind of extreme and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.019" end="00:15:35.700" style="s2">yesterday he brought out another very</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.470" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">sort of slickly produced</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:41.460" style="s2">piece that was clearly in response to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">that but he obviously didn&#39;t mention it</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.460" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">he didn&#39;t mention that he done anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">he didn&#39;t mention any of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">just just sort of I need to be more</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:51.720" style="s2">transparent clearly I have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">with communicating and I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.720" end="00:15:54.510" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">hey it&#39;s Brian rose from London real and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.510" end="00:15:59.130" style="s2">I just wanted to take a few minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">talk about the digital freedom platform</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.130" end="00:16:02.730" style="s2">and hopefully talk about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:05.130" style="s2">questions and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.730" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">misunderstandings that have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.130" end="00:16:09.030" style="s2">flying around out there and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">give you some clarity as to what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.030" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">on so I made some notes and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:15.690" style="s2">gonna go here kind of off the cuff and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">stream-of-consciousness as far as what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.690" end="00:16:21.420" style="s2">been going on first of all I just want</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">to say that I am notoriously a bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.420" end="00:16:24.690" style="s2">communicator and so that&#39;s what today is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.700" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">all about</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.690" end="00:16:29.280" style="s2">I got an unsettled feeling watching that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.910" end="00:16:32.220" style="s2">extremely unsettled because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.280" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">difference between what he said a day</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.220" end="00:16:37.950" style="s2">ago and what he said the very next day</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">was so far apart it seemed like I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.950" end="00:16:42.650" style="s2">watching I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say like</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">a chameleon something changing colors</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.650" end="00:16:48.660" style="s2">purely based on environmental factors</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:50.400" style="s2">which made it totally unbelievable you</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:52.140" style="s2">know because one second he&#39;s calling his</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.400" end="00:16:53.520" style="s2">audience idiots and then the next second</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.140" end="00:16:56.400" style="s2">he&#39;s sitting in front of a camera saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.520" end="00:16:57.930" style="s2">you know what I was bad at communicating</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.400" end="00:16:59.280" style="s2">I want to explain this whole thing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.930" end="00:17:01.740" style="s2">you guys I want to be open to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.280" end="00:17:04.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like wait this is not the same</p>

<p begin="00:17:06.450" end="00:17:09.540" style="s2">he won&#39;t address it he won&#39;t address the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">fact that he was belittling his audience</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.540" end="00:17:14.790" style="s2">whatever and so I think it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.070" style="s2">strange and like I think Brian just felt</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.790" end="00:17:20.460" style="s2">trapped and I think it shows how much he</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.070" end="00:17:22.260" style="s2">can sort of put it on you know like one</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.460" end="00:17:23.490" style="s2">second he totally believes he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.260" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">need to explain himself the next second</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.490" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">I really care about you guys and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:30.810" style="s2">really want to do better and edit it up</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.820" style="s2">very weird yeah and I think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.810" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">kind of flagging up some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.820" end="00:17:36.660" style="s2">stuff that we there&#39;s kind of happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">in the background as well and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:42.410" style="s2">been sent so we know that they delete</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:46.140" style="s2">some comments off the YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.410" end="00:17:49.240" style="s2">they also have their own internal London</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:52.059" style="s2">real messaging system that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.240" end="00:17:53.740" style="s2">pree flagging certain certain work</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.059" end="00:17:56.470" style="s2">keywords and certain topics that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.740" end="00:17:58.030" style="s2">can&#39;t post so that includes like someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.470" end="00:18:00.460" style="s2">someone sent me some screenshots that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.030" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">that includes dailymotion that includes</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.460" end="00:18:06.700" style="s2">snake oil so anyone trying to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:09.900" style="s2">the stuff internally is not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.700" end="00:18:13.150" style="s2">so I think this is worth flagging up</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.900" end="00:18:14.650" style="s2">which is another thing about sort of yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:16.330" style="s2">free speech we can talk about anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.650" end="00:18:19.510" style="s2">but don&#39;t question me I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.330" end="00:18:21.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really quite astonishing and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.510" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">another thing that we found out from</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.960" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">quite a few different places is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:31.660" style="s2">there was a big a lot of his staff were</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:33.010" style="s2">not happy about him doing the the David</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.660" end="00:18:34.929" style="s2">Icke interview they thought it was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.010" end="00:18:38.890" style="s2">the right interview to do in the current</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.929" end="00:18:40.210" style="s2">situation they didn&#39;t want they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.890" end="00:18:41.620" style="s2">think it was responsible</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.210" end="00:18:43.750" style="s2">they knew what David Icke was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.620" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">saying when he came on so a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.750" end="00:18:50.050" style="s2">staff objected to the David I continued</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:52.270" style="s2">happening it at all and subsequent to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.050" end="00:18:54.790" style="s2">lap 2 that a lot of them were either</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.270" end="00:18:56.890" style="s2">sacked or made redundant quite quite a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.790" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">large number of London real staff he</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.890" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">went he went from sort of what 14 or 15</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">staff down to a very very small number</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:06.040" style="s2">of staff that was before any of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:08.350" style="s2">fundraising happened I think something</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.040" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">worth highlighting here is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.350" end="00:19:12.280" style="s2">had people coming to us from behind the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.380" style="s2">scenes we haven&#39;t talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.280" end="00:19:16.450" style="s2">either of our investigations but with</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.380" end="00:19:18.040" style="s2">some knowledge of the London real</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.450" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">situation we&#39;ve got a much clearer</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.040" end="00:19:24.700" style="s2">picture of what&#39;s going on that do raise</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">inconsistencies maybe hypocrisy is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.700" end="00:19:27.910" style="s2">because while you can make the free</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.320" style="s2">speech argument like you said about</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.910" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">David Icke I don&#39;t even think you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.320" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">to I think you can simply point out the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:35.890" style="s2">fact that Brian Rose wants it both ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:37.090" style="s2">he wants to on the one hand say he&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.890" end="00:19:38.410" style="s2">about free speech free speech free</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.090" end="00:19:39.820" style="s2">speech you can say whatever you want I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.410" end="00:19:41.290" style="s2">fight for free speech but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:43.750" style="s2">hand he also wants to censor comments at</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.290" end="00:19:47.110" style="s2">a critical of him like how can he want</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.750" end="00:19:48.760" style="s2">you to to not censor anything of his but</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.110" end="00:19:50.800" style="s2">he wants to censor his audience himself</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.760" end="00:19:52.780" style="s2">he wants the control goes on his on his</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.179" end="00:20:01.630" style="s2">says is so much for free speech it says</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:13.390" style="s2">Guidelines repurposed for Brian Rose it</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.770" end="00:20:15.880" style="s2">it seems like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.390" end="00:20:17.560" style="s2">Brian Rose is unhappy with YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.880" end="00:20:19.330" style="s2">calling the shots and so he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.560" end="00:20:22.270" style="s2">make a platform where he called the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.330" end="00:20:23.680" style="s2">shots but that doesn&#39;t get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.270" end="00:20:25.510" style="s2">press who&#39;s gonna build Brian Rose his</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.680" end="00:20:28.210" style="s2">own platform well if all of a sudden you</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:36.190" style="s2">employees for a second I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:38.740" style="s2">worth talking about only in the context</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.190" end="00:20:39.880" style="s2">of look Brian Rose wants to use your</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.740" end="00:20:41.650" style="s2">fundraising and I&#39;m talking to the</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.010" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">moving it right on to the audience&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.110" end="00:21:07.990" style="s2">payroll and I think people should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:09.700" style="s2">upset about I think they have the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.990" end="00:21:12.910" style="s2">to be upset about it because things</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.700" end="00:21:15.700" style="s2">aren&#39;t being transparently communicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.910" end="00:21:16.900" style="s2">here yeah I wanted to also just ask</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.700" end="00:21:19.420" style="s2">because something you said yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.900" end="00:21:20.650" style="s2">when we when we chatted before this made</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.420" end="00:21:24.310" style="s2">a lot of sense and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.650" end="00:21:26.410" style="s2">been spelled out and that is just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.310" end="00:21:28.270" style="s2">major kind of issue with the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.410" end="00:21:31.260" style="s2">because also in his in his latest</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.270" end="00:21:33.730" style="s2">message he said yes I used dailymotion</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.260" end="00:21:35.710" style="s2">which was a part of the the initial film</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.730" end="00:21:37.060" style="s2">that I put out like actually he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.710" end="00:21:38.890" style="s2">dailymotion it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.060" end="00:21:39.880" style="s2">private streaming and it was funny</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.890" end="00:21:41.770" style="s2">because a lot of comments are like</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.880" end="00:21:42.970" style="s2">you&#39;re using dailymotion because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.770" end="00:21:45.040" style="s2">free and I was like yeah I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.970" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">spend your money I&#39;d rather it be free</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.040" end="00:21:48.910" style="s2">until I have to spend it now we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.470" end="00:21:50.140" style="s2">to a dedicated provider for all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.910" end="00:21:52.810" style="s2">controversial service but I will</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.140" end="00:21:54.790" style="s2">continue to use free means and free</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.810" end="00:21:56.800" style="s2">software because I don&#39;t want to use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.790" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">funds of this platform but when we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:01.300" style="s2">to spend I will spend but I will spend</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">frugally but you you actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.300" end="00:22:06.430" style="s2">flagged up that there&#39;s no real reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:08.260" style="s2">given that he&#39;s already said look I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.430" end="00:22:11.050" style="s2">use free platforms and save your money</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.260" end="00:22:12.120" style="s2">if like if I can because I&#39;m caring</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.050" end="00:22:14.260" style="s2">about how I&#39;m spending your money</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.120" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no real reason for him to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.260" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">doing any of this because I&#39;d be using</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:18.780" style="s2">bit suit</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:21.150" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the funniest thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.780" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">world to me because it makes zero sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.150" end="00:22:24.900" style="s2">as soon as Brian Rose said that I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:26.160" style="s2">like okay your whole thing makes zero</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.900" end="00:22:27.540" style="s2">since you&#39;ve raised all this money for</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.160" end="00:22:29.340" style="s2">nothing other than yourself and your own</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.540" end="00:22:31.170" style="s2">ego about having your own platform</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.340" end="00:22:33.300" style="s2">because listen guys listen to me for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.170" end="00:22:35.970" style="s2">second okay think about it this way what</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.300" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">costs all the money livestreaming why</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.970" end="00:22:39.480" style="s2">not just do like put it on bit shoot</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.980" end="00:22:41.700" style="s2">right they&#39;re not gonna censor you this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.480" end="00:22:43.410" style="s2">thing already exists you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.700" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">pay for it your your supporters sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.410" end="00:22:47.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have to pay for it embed it in</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:49.050" style="s2">your platform and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.250" end="00:22:50.910" style="s2">say this guy&#39;s we&#39;re not gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.050" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">live what&#39;s so hard about that why does</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.910" end="00:22:54.330" style="s2">he need to do it live it&#39;s not like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:56.070" style="s2">he&#39;s a twitch streamer who reads off</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.330" end="00:22:58.920" style="s2">donations it&#39;s not like he interacts</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:23:01.380" style="s2">with the audience give me one rationale</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.920" end="00:23:02.820" style="s2">for why live-streaming is so critical</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.380" end="00:23:04.560" style="s2">when it&#39;s the most expensive part and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.820" end="00:23:06.300" style="s2">says in his little thing right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.560" end="00:23:08.370" style="s2">extremely frugal I would never spend</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.300" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">your money if I don&#39;t have to but all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.370" end="00:23:11.640" style="s2">a sudden there&#39;s this ego trip about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.320" style="s2">has to go up like why the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.640" end="00:23:15.450" style="s2">people who watch content are watching it</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.320" end="00:23:15.810" style="s2">pre-recorded like that&#39;s just how it</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.450" end="00:23:18.330" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.810" end="00:23:20.010" style="s2">it&#39;s fine and also you can pre record</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.330" end="00:23:22.440" style="s2">and do a premiere like people do on</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.010" end="00:23:24.750" style="s2">YouTube kind of simulate the liveness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.440" end="00:23:26.220" style="s2">it I mean I always rag on people for</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.750" end="00:23:27.780" style="s2">doing pre-recorded webinars and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.220" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">pretending it&#39;s live but this would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.780" end="00:23:32.760" style="s2">the one instance where I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:34.710" style="s2">give Brian Rose full permission and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.760" end="00:23:37.410" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t rag on him for doing a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.710" end="00:23:39.240" style="s2">pre-recorded live webinar if it was to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.410" end="00:23:41.490" style="s2">save people millions of dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.240" end="00:23:44.160" style="s2">pointless live streaming costs that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.490" end="00:23:47.490" style="s2">ultimately again what does it serve</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.160" end="00:23:50.130" style="s2">except for Brian Rose&#39;s ego to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.490" end="00:23:51.270" style="s2">about to two possibilities one he builds</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.130" end="00:23:53.610" style="s2">his digital freedom platform for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.270" end="00:23:55.620" style="s2">millions of dollars and you get a live</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.610" end="00:23:58.950" style="s2">stream the other is he just embeds it on</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.620" end="00:24:01.110" style="s2">bit shoot where costs $0 tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.950" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">difference in actual like practice if</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.110" end="00:24:06.450" style="s2">you if I don&#39;t think Brian Rose can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:08.160" style="s2">it it makes zero sense it&#39;s gets me</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.450" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">fired up because this is the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.160" end="00:24:12.840" style="s2">this is the entire thing is he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">saying I&#39;m frugal I&#39;m doing it for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.840" end="00:24:16.170" style="s2">guys that it out we don&#39;t have a digital</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:18.600" style="s2">freedom platform the most egotistical</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.170" end="00:24:20.370" style="s2">thing I ever heard was we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.600" end="00:24:22.890" style="s2">the first ever ever digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.370" end="00:24:27.090" style="s2">platform and we have decided to create</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.890" end="00:24:28.610" style="s2">the very first digital freedom platform</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.090" end="00:24:30.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.610" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">except in name only like people like</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.770" end="00:24:33.410" style="s2">bitch shoot have been doing this forever</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:35.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of other platforms as</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.410" end="00:24:37.450" style="s2">well who are freedom of speech like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.330" end="00:24:40.370" style="s2">platforms this is just Brian&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.450" end="00:24:42.679" style="s2">spin-off and his own egotistical you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.370" end="00:24:44.420" style="s2">know ramblings about yeah this is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.679" end="00:24:46.370" style="s2">first one ever absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.420" end="00:24:50.450" style="s2">yeah and this is this is a slight segue</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.370" end="00:24:53.650" style="s2">but it&#39;s why so you go back to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.450" end="00:24:56.750" style="s2">the platform wars patreon for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.650" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">there was a whole thing I think around</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.750" end="00:25:01.730" style="s2">Christmas last year or the year before</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:04.809" style="s2">where patreon kicked off sargon of akkad</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.730" end="00:25:08.419" style="s2">and sam Harris left Jordan Pederson left</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.809" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">we left rebel wisdom left we we now only</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.419" end="00:25:12.830" style="s2">have to sign up on our website because</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">we&#39;re like we don&#39;t want to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.830" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">mercy of these big tech platforms just</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:19.309" style="s2">making decisions on who who gets to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:21.620" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s a person and who&#39;s a nun</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.309" end="00:25:23.030" style="s2">person and so a lot of us dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.620" end="00:25:25.730" style="s2">these issues back then we thought about</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.030" end="00:25:27.620" style="s2">these questions and obviously Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.730" end="00:25:29.809" style="s2">peed and went Peterson went off and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.620" end="00:25:31.190" style="s2">creative think spot the platform because</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.809" end="00:25:34.280" style="s2">if you go and create a platform you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.190" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">to wrestle with actual issues like if</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.280" end="00:25:37.669" style="s2">Bryan Rose had gone off and said look we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:40.910" style="s2">need to create a digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.669" end="00:25:42.410" style="s2">platform and now are now aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">other people who wanted to do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.410" end="00:25:46.309" style="s2">because we&#39;re all worried about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:49.130" style="s2">issue that would have been a completely</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.309" end="00:25:50.630" style="s2">different dynamic because in that but in</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.130" end="00:25:51.710" style="s2">that dynamic he would have actually had</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.630" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">to face some of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:57.080" style="s2">everyone else has had to face when they</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:59.620" style="s2">when they deal with this which is one do</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.080" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">you allow Nazis on your platform like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.620" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">are you gonna have any gatekeeping</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:06.260" style="s2">whatsoever who&#39;s gonna make those</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:08.270" style="s2">decisions like we all you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.260" end="00:26:11.179" style="s2">those questions if you actually deal</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.270" end="00:26:12.410" style="s2">with the problem properly but he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.179" end="00:26:14.150" style="s2">deal with the problem properly you just</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.410" end="00:26:15.260" style="s2">basically said okay I&#39;ll create this</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.150" end="00:26:17.299" style="s2">thing called the digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.260" end="00:26:18.890" style="s2">platform that&#39;s gonna be independent of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.299" end="00:26:20.390" style="s2">London real even though it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.890" end="00:26:22.730" style="s2">fully owned by him and it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.390" end="00:26:24.169" style="s2">within the London real website did you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.730" end="00:26:25.640" style="s2">talk about that for a second because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.169" end="00:26:27.290" style="s2">think that&#39;s like the weirdest thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.640" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">that he calls it a dependent when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.290" end="00:26:32.150" style="s2">not um I think it&#39;s worth just playing</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.160" style="s2">the clip just to sort of back up that he</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.150" end="00:26:35.630" style="s2">did definitely declare that was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.160" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">the case and it&#39;s about something that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.630" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">want to separate from London real and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:41.149" style="s2">have it is this separately funded</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:42.619" style="s2">platform so again the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.149" end="00:26:44.749" style="s2">freedom platform is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.619" end="00:26:50.629" style="s2">separate entity that&#39;s the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.749" end="00:26:52.190" style="s2">can&#39;t get my head around is why he ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.629" end="00:26:53.869" style="s2">said that if it was always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.190" end="00:26:57.099" style="s2">hosted within the London real website</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.869" end="00:26:59.719" style="s2">and I think you mentioned something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.099" end="00:27:02.179" style="s2">because you you called the cast to find</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.719" end="00:27:04.070" style="s2">out how much the the stream was going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.179" end="00:27:06.229" style="s2">be or the stream had been for the IKE</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.070" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">interview and they said so you got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.229" end="00:27:13.399" style="s2">figure for that and you also he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:15.289" style="s2">conceded that the cost of the streaming</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.399" end="00:27:16.759" style="s2">alone for Roseate three was sixty two</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.289" end="00:27:18.769" style="s2">thousand five hundred dollars you also</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.759" end="00:27:20.839" style="s2">worked out with that that was a tacit</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.769" end="00:27:22.729" style="s2">admission why wouldn&#39;t you explain that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.839" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">sure yeah I&#39;d love to first of all let</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.729" end="00:27:26.779" style="s2">me take a big W on this because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:28.489" style="s2">in my comment section was saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.779" end="00:27:31.339" style="s2">was wrong about how much it cost and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.489" end="00:27:33.080" style="s2">like I was incorrect because of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.339" end="00:27:35.960" style="s2">some technicality about what they said I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.080" end="00:27:38.929" style="s2">said it was 60 mm the real cost was 61</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:42.200" style="s2">thousand or I might have that flip so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.929" end="00:27:45.139" style="s2">was dead on okay let me let me hold that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.200" end="00:27:48.019" style="s2">real quick okay I&#39;m done but the second</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.139" end="00:27:49.159" style="s2">thing was about concerning the the rest</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.019" end="00:27:51.529" style="s2">of the money right because he goes oh no</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.159" end="00:27:53.779" style="s2">it really did cost 100,000 odds was well</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.529" end="00:27:56.149" style="s2">over a hundred thousand well over well</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.779" end="00:27:57.979" style="s2">why if it only costs $60,000 to live</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.149" end="00:27:59.599" style="s2">stream let&#39;s just recap I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.979" end="00:28:01.070" style="s2">said a lot that maybe people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.599" end="00:28:03.080" style="s2">aware they might not be following oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.070" end="00:28:04.759" style="s2">sure basically he claimed it was going</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.080" end="00:28:09.049" style="s2">to be a hundred thousand dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.759" end="00:28:10.460" style="s2">stream like three yes it was found out a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.049" end="00:28:13.190" style="s2">few people found out that it was done</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.460" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">through day cast you called a cast and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.190" end="00:28:16.879" style="s2">they said oh hang on you said I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:17.869" style="s2">stream to a million people how much</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.879" end="00:28:19.129" style="s2">would that cost and they said oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.869" end="00:28:21.229" style="s2">actually we&#39;ve just done that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.129" end="00:28:27.559" style="s2">weekend and it cost sixty one thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.229" end="00:28:29.629" style="s2">dollars that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.559" end="00:28:31.729" style="s2">yeah and so Brian Rose later concedes</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.629" end="00:28:33.379" style="s2">that point in in his little update or</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.550" end="00:29:06.050" style="s2">upgrading London real which supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.830" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">should be independent from the digital</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.410" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">explanation the whole problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.870" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">the things he&#39;s saying turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:54.170" style="s2">lies him saying that he&#39;s gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.600" style="s2">fundraising he can maybe create a</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.570" end="00:30:11.030" style="s2">right now that he spent at least forty</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.700" end="00:30:12.920" style="s2">thousand dollars or more on server space</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.540" style="s2">happening so Brian Rose under the guise</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.800" end="00:33:04.250" style="s2">of you know I have all these new emails</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.540" end="00:33:08.030" style="s2">then sells a crypto scam</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.250" end="00:33:09.860" style="s2">well after he sells it interestingly he</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.030" end="00:33:12.290" style="s2">deletes the videos he deletes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.860" end="00:33:14.360" style="s2">evidence of him promoting that scheme</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.290" end="00:33:16.220" style="s2">because now he&#39;s made his money and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.360" end="00:33:18.020" style="s2">can move on because the event had</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.220" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">already happened but Danis just thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.020" end="00:33:22.190" style="s2">let&#39;s to stop that because sir I did</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.410" style="s2">see I didn&#39;t notice that they have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.190" end="00:33:27.070" style="s2">deleted until you pointed it out but so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.410" end="00:33:29.720" style="s2">he sent he sent the email out to his</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.070" end="00:33:31.970" style="s2">supporters and then had like two or</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.720" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">three videos on London real it was like</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.970" end="00:33:36.620" style="s2">four or five it was like four or five is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:39.710" style="s2">a lot with with tika Tiwari pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.620" end="00:33:42.830" style="s2">this scheme and then afterwards deleted</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.710" end="00:33:44.179" style="s2">those videos which in itself is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.830" end="00:33:45.710" style="s2">bizarre thing to do I mean he probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.179" end="00:33:47.210" style="s2">claimed that YouTube took them down</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.710" end="00:33:49.130" style="s2">maybe but that wouldn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.210" end="00:33:51.110" style="s2">because you know there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.130" end="00:33:52.340" style="s2">other ticket to worry videos up so</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.110" end="00:33:55.190" style="s2">they&#39;re not taking down ticket to where</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.340" end="00:33:57.559" style="s2">he videos no Brian took them down I feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.190" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">confident saying that and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.559" end="00:34:02.390" style="s2">he got a backlash on it he&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.530" style="s2">like freedom and not give transparency</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.390" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">right up to the point when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.530" end="00:34:07.550" style="s2">criticized and then he will change tact</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:09.110" style="s2">right he go he promotes this crypto</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.550" end="00:34:10.429" style="s2">thing right before he&#39;s criticized then</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.110" end="00:34:12.889" style="s2">all of a sudden deletes the videos he</p>

<p begin="00:34:17.540" end="00:34:19.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have to explain this to you right</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.919" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">up into the point where he gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.790" end="00:34:23.270" style="s2">criticized then he turns around and says</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.420" end="00:37:43.350" style="s2">not to get dragged into because I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.580" end="00:37:47.940" style="s2">I said in one of my last updates like</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.350" end="00:37:50.420" style="s2">the the pattern that I see Brian doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.940" end="00:37:52.980" style="s2">and many other people doing is what</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.810" end="00:38:14.370" style="s2">like it&#39;s a brilliant brilliant article</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.070" end="00:38:28.680" style="s2">about creating an army just goes all-out</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.470" end="00:38:32.280" style="s2">with the war kind of talk it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:33.660" style="s2">kind of a how-to so how do you talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.280" end="00:38:35.160" style="s2">about this how do you pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.660" end="00:38:38.430" style="s2">without getting drawn into that same</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.160" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">dynamic yourself how do I get drawn into</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.430" end="00:38:44.270" style="s2">kind of looking at it making films about</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">it without just feeding that dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.270" end="00:38:49.710" style="s2">one of them is this sort of and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.390" style="s2">morality tale like the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.710" end="00:38:53.250" style="s2">dimensions and the morality tale of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.390" end="00:38:55.740" style="s2">is also just such a fascinating thing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.250" end="00:38:58.530" style="s2">look at like what must it be like right</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.740" end="00:39:01.800" style="s2">now to be in that space what must it be</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.530" end="00:39:05.550" style="s2">like to be to have built what looks to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">me into you like a kind of a trap for</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.550" end="00:39:08.520" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:10.080" style="s2">like it seems certainly on Sunday and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.520" end="00:39:12.510" style="s2">some of the comments of the latest</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.080" end="00:39:15.990" style="s2">videos it does seem like the audience is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.510" end="00:39:17.640" style="s2">really starting to turn and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.990" end="00:39:19.560" style="s2">one thing to put out a film that people</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.640" end="00:39:23.820" style="s2">don&#39;t like it&#39;s another thing to take</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.560" end="00:39:27.180" style="s2">lots of money off people and then insult</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.820" end="00:39:28.950" style="s2">them for asking you questions like</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.180" end="00:39:30.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different dynamic like</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.950" end="00:39:32.310" style="s2">it&#39;s hard enough when you&#39;re when when</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.840" end="00:39:34.260" style="s2">you put out a film that your audience</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.310" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like it God knows what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.260" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">what you&#39;ve actually taken lots of money</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">off them for something and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:41.510" style="s2">asking hang on what happened to my money</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:44.670" style="s2">what happened to this platform and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.510" end="00:39:45.990" style="s2">yeah the psychological dimension of and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.670" end="00:39:47.640" style="s2">someone who&#39;s been open in the past</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.990" end="00:39:50.850" style="s2">about having had addiction problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.640" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">about having it&#39;s like and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.850" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2">of people feel that they know him like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:55.830" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the the journey</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:57.450" style="s2">with London real is that people feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.830" end="00:40:00.690" style="s2">that they know who Brian Rose is to some</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.450" end="00:40:01.270" style="s2">degree and I think I said in my first</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.690" end="00:40:03.750" style="s2">film</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.270" end="00:40:06.760" style="s2">my sense is there are two Brian roses</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.750" end="00:40:10.660" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s the businessman</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.890" end="00:40:27.730" style="s2">than one person who knows Brian Rose has</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.200" end="00:40:30.010" style="s2">known Brian rose for a while say that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.730" end="00:40:32.110" style="s2">that was absolutely accurate you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.010" end="00:40:33.400" style="s2">almost picture him with like the the</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.890" end="00:40:55.750" style="s2">your followers as you can and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.930" end="00:40:58.390" style="s2">that&#39;s been a trajectory and I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.750" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">a way out that does not involve some</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.390" end="00:41:06.100" style="s2">kind of miracle per some kind of apology</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:10.600" style="s2">but human psychology is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.100" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">like to actually do that is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.600" end="00:41:22.180" style="s2">difficult and I wonder how I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:24.610" style="s2">I and that&#39;s part of this as well is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.180" end="00:41:26.140" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know when when and if</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.610" end="00:41:31.210" style="s2">something like this comes crashing down</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.140" end="00:41:35.080" style="s2">what people do and I think realizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.210" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">that that&#39;s yeah the balance of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.080" end="00:41:40.900" style="s2">rights and responsibilities of do I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.690" style="s2">a responsibility to call this out I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.900" end="00:41:46.690" style="s2">think so as I said in my first film I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.690" end="00:41:49.060" style="s2">think the whole double bind of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.690" end="00:41:55.140" style="s2">of speech is that we have to use it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.060" end="00:41:58.330" style="s2">it becomes a a self-correcting process</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.140" end="00:41:59.800" style="s2">or we&#39;re probably going to lose it</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.330" end="00:42:02.890" style="s2">because the big tech platforms are just</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.800" end="00:42:06.550" style="s2">gonna say we&#39;re gonna decide who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.890" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">allowed to speak and who isn&#39;t so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.550" end="00:42:10.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of wrestled with with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.230" end="00:42:14.680" style="s2">from the beginning of like how can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.420" end="00:42:20.470" style="s2">do this in a way that is honest is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">authentic is not not seeing someone as</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.470" end="00:42:27.990" style="s2">an enemy that needs to be attacked but</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.870" end="00:42:32.770" style="s2">as someone who is like in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.990" end="00:42:34.090" style="s2">there go all of us like some of the some</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.770" end="00:42:36.250" style="s2">of the other things that this brings up</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.090" end="00:42:38.320" style="s2">to me is like the weird incentive</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.250" end="00:42:40.780" style="s2">structures of alternative media sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.320" end="00:42:43.810" style="s2">like that there&#39;s lots of these so</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.780" end="00:42:46.230" style="s2">basically this whole business model of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.810" end="00:42:49.090" style="s2">you have two million YouTube subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.230" end="00:42:51.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of places</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.090" end="00:42:53.710" style="s2">like this now which have I find in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.700" end="00:42:55.480" style="s2">different ways to monetize attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.710" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">they have attention through the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.480" end="00:42:58.540" style="s2">they&#39;ve got on they get more people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.740" style="s2">go on because of the all the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.540" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">people they&#39;ve had go on so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.740" end="00:43:06.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of those around there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:09.270" style="s2">lot of those around and the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.850" end="00:43:11.410" style="s2">to like I mean rebel wisdom has</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.270" end="00:43:14.590" style="s2">something like that as a business model</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.410" end="00:43:16.390" style="s2">in that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a media channel</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.590" end="00:43:18.580" style="s2">first and foremost but we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.390" end="00:43:21.700" style="s2">pay the bills we have memberships we run</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.580" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">online courses so those so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.700" end="00:43:25.450" style="s2">just say oh the business model is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:27.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more nuanced conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.450" end="00:43:28.810" style="s2">than that it&#39;s like how can you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.460" end="00:43:31.090" style="s2">when you&#39;re being authentic and when</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.810" end="00:43:32.860" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not being authentic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.090" end="00:43:36.390" style="s2">let me jump in here real quick because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.860" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s fair to say that okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.390" end="00:43:42.070" style="s2">maybe you know if I were in the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:44.620" style="s2">shoes there go I whatever but I think at</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.070" end="00:43:48.100" style="s2">the same time you have to be aware that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.620" end="00:43:49.630" style="s2">what he&#39;s done has when you descend into</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.100" end="00:43:51.940" style="s2">the particular you can see some</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.630" end="00:43:54.250" style="s2">definitely areas where he just went</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.940" end="00:43:56.920" style="s2">wrong where he&#39;s talking about head</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.250" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">faking his audience you can&#39;t do that to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.920" end="00:43:59.860" style="s2">an audience when you&#39;re raising a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:02.620" style="s2">million dollars you just can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.860" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">tell them hey I&#39;m having to lie to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.620" end="00:44:05.620" style="s2">about certain things you can&#39;t tell them</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:08.170" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna build a digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.620" end="00:44:09.970" style="s2">freedom platform but then like weeks</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.170" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">later say oh by the way I&#39;ve been using</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.970" end="00:44:14.170" style="s2">free platforms all along and you should</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:15.940" style="s2">have known that and then not explain why</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.170" end="00:44:18.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not just using the most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.940" end="00:44:19.180" style="s2">free speech platform that there is you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.280" end="00:44:21.010" style="s2">can&#39;t say that you&#39;re gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.180" end="00:44:23.800" style="s2">fundraising and then keep on fundraising</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.010" end="00:44:26.170" style="s2">under the name of this value that we all</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.800" end="00:44:27.820" style="s2">hold so dear but then really not stand</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.170" end="00:44:28.510" style="s2">up to scrutiny when it&#39;s questioned do</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.820" end="00:44:30.700" style="s2">you really</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.510" end="00:44:33.070" style="s2">and up for that value at all I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.700" end="00:44:36.310" style="s2">there are some very clear areas where</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.070" end="00:44:37.930" style="s2">he&#39;s gone from okay you can monetize an</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.310" end="00:44:40.840" style="s2">audience their ethical ways to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.930" end="00:44:42.250" style="s2">attention nobody works for free but</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.840" end="00:44:43.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.250" end="00:44:45.220" style="s2">not why people are upset people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.660" end="00:44:48.430" style="s2">upset because of the lying because of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.220" end="00:44:51.190" style="s2">the duplicity because of the hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.430" end="00:44:53.260" style="s2">the gigantic gaping hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.190" end="00:44:55.990" style="s2">surrounding this whole thing so while we</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.260" end="00:44:58.270" style="s2">can kind of amuse that you know but for</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.990" end="00:45:00.040" style="s2">the grace of God there go i all we want</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.270" end="00:45:02.740" style="s2">but at the end of the day we can point</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.040" end="00:45:05.020" style="s2">to concrete things that concretely has</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.740" end="00:45:07.960" style="s2">have been the reason for his sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.020" end="00:45:10.990" style="s2">downfall and the reason that he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.960" end="00:45:12.460" style="s2">position that he is I heard a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.990" end="00:45:14.890" style="s2">mine who was talking to about this I</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.460" end="00:45:16.420" style="s2">think it really sums up the way a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.890" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">people are feeling right now he goes man</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.420" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">it&#39;s such a shame what&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:22.330" style="s2">with lended real because the guy had so</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">many great guests on he goes I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.330" end="00:45:25.750" style="s2">agree with everything the guy said but</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:28.150" style="s2">he had some really great guests on and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.750" end="00:45:30.910" style="s2">he was building a long-term reputation</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.150" end="00:45:33.460" style="s2">that was gonna kind of last and build</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.910" end="00:45:35.980" style="s2">into something sort of greater than what</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.460" end="00:45:38.500" style="s2">London real currently is and that has</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.980" end="00:45:40.660" style="s2">sort of been traded I mean this person</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.500" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">that had a pretty decent amount of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.660" end="00:45:44.170" style="s2">respect for this person who&#39;s close to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">friend of mine no longer has that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:47.500" style="s2">respect he&#39;s like yeah I won&#39;t watch</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.480" style="s2">another like what am I gonna watch the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.500" end="00:45:51.580" style="s2">guy who&#39;s having all the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.480" end="00:45:53.410" style="s2">theorists on who&#39;s you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.580" end="00:45:55.870" style="s2">lying about the way he&#39;s handling this</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.410" end="00:45:57.400" style="s2">money no he&#39;s not going to anymore and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.870" end="00:46:00.040" style="s2">think a lot of people are wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.400" end="00:46:03.160" style="s2">this London real they had in their mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.040" end="00:46:04.930" style="s2">like six weeks ago versus the London</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.160" end="00:46:06.210" style="s2">real and the actions of Brian Rose that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.930" end="00:46:09.970" style="s2">they see before them today</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.210" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">nice little rant to end on sorry no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.970" end="00:46:13.870" style="s2">good it was good I think I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.030" style="s2">right you&#39;re right I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.870" end="00:46:18.010" style="s2">hold all of those perspectives at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.030" end="00:46:21.750" style="s2">same time I think you&#39;re right in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.010" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">that I&#39;m wary of that dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.750" end="00:46:26.440" style="s2">unexamined judgment of other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.540" style="s2">because that comes back and bite you in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.440" end="00:46:30.460" style="s2">the ass as well it sure does which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.540" end="00:46:31.960" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s important to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.460" end="00:46:34.150" style="s2">said it in my video yesterday but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.960" end="00:46:36.270" style="s2">think that we should say here we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.150" end="00:46:38.650" style="s2">both reached out to Brian Rose on</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.270" end="00:46:40.810" style="s2">numerous occasions to give him the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.650" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">chance to respond we have I</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.810" end="00:46:44.080" style="s2">I personally emailed him four times</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:46.900" style="s2">David how many times do you think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.080" end="00:46:48.730" style="s2">emailed him six six times so between us</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.900" end="00:46:51.940" style="s2">ten times have we reached out to Bryan</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.730" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">in the effort of getting an examined</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.940" end="00:46:58.270" style="s2">judgment in the effort of getting an</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:47:00.070" style="s2">understood full 360 of the situation it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.270" end="00:47:02.230" style="s2">has not been us that is unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.070" end="00:47:04.150" style="s2">come to the table unfortunately it has</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.230" end="00:47:05.380" style="s2">been Bryan rose for what he may have his</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.150" end="00:47:09.010" style="s2">own reasons they might be good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.380" end="00:47:10.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s been his decision to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.010" end="00:47:12.940" style="s2">people who are criticizing him out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.840" end="00:47:14.710" style="s2">the full picture and unfortunately if</p>
