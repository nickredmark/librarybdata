<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">all right so</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.439" end="00:00:07.839" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about failure how can we try</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">to fail at creating community</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:10.960" style="s2">if we just really wanted to fail at it</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:13.120" style="s2">like what is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">is it the producers or they try to put</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.120" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">on a failed</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">nazi musical and ends up being a success</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">but they need it to be a failure</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">that was i just feel like i need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">throw it here that&#39;s a little bit what i</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:25.359" style="s2">thought the trump presidency was in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:27.039" style="s2">beginning i was like waiting for him to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">be like you&#39;re kidding me right you guys</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.039" end="00:00:32.000" style="s2">actually elected me and like step away i</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:32.719" style="s2">thought that&#39;s what happened i thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">he was like</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">this is weird that this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.880" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">but but that aside no we might talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:43.360" style="s2">about trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:46.719" style="s2">um if we wanted to fail at creating an</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">intentional community what would we do</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">to be absolutely miserable at it</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">i think um a lot of rules very strict</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">rules i get to control everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">that i think would be a great no one</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">which would be like double failure</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.720" style="s2">because i both really don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">you&#39;d have to micromanage everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be happy so</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be happy and they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">happy it&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">okay so too many rules</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">one of the first things that came to my</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:24.640" style="s2">mind uh reading the topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">uh was just the the feeling that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.640" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">from the the community like good good</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">communities good relationships people</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">kind of get a sense of being energized</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">by them uh they get they get recharged</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">they come out of it feeling you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">kind of more alive and more excited and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">more ready to go take on the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:44.079" style="s2">versus anything that they kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">to sink energy into</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.079" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">and leaves them feeling drained or like</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a chore</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">or just one more obligation on top of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">the 15 other obligations that they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">in any given day or week</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">very different you know essential</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">quality there</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">so it sounds a little bit like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">saying that a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">thing is for people to feel uplifted by</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">interactions so if you were to fail at</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">you would make people feel worse in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">way from</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">interactions yeah it&#39;s really an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">measure on the tail end</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">of you know did you succeed or fail and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">i think that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">a lot of that what people would say is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">success or failures probably correlated</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">with that how did it make me feel uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">i think promising big things they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">delivering like here&#39;s and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">goes to what james was saying like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">here&#39;s my vision for a community but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">make it like you do all the work</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">you get all the people like you put all</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">of your energy into it but for my vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">which is like the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">to fail</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">um one of the things that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">is participation</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">not giving people enough avenues to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">so if you have too large of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">that is kind of like you need some</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">leadership in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">but someone who is the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">they&#39;re like a control freak and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">can&#39;t take their hands off of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">uh when new people show up you need ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">for them to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">hey yeah we&#39;ve got something for you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">do people want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">like they&#39;re participating that&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">of feeling valuable if i say</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">well you can just sit around because i</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">have nothing for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">that ability to delegate um even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">you know big things or small things or</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">avenues for participation is uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">and i might extend that participation</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">out into sense of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">kind of even stronger that feeling of oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">you know i</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">i own this i made this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">uh i had a hand in creating this</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">um so the participation would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">thing so the bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">i i think yeah someone having</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">being a micromanaging personality they</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">can&#39;t take their hands off of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">um they&#39;re too controlling</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">that one or a few people in a community</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">that have power seems like a bad mix</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">uh the recipe for um</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">not a good outcome i think with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">no training in what you&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">like you go and build this cob house but</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">like you get no training and will berate</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">and having an assigned task that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">expected to be good at with no training</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">as opposed to a a task that does speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">to you right and it&#39;s either something</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re challenging yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">learn and you have mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">or something you&#39;re already good at and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">want to to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">having so like like no you&#39;re the farmer</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">daniel from now on you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the farm work and if we all</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">starve it&#39;s on you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got too many rules um</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">situations that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">are draining energy uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">no avenues for participation and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">some reasons why that would be good</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">people want a sense of hey i&#39;m valuable</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">when i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">also zero diversity like all one age</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">all one income level all one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">that isn&#39;t very clear</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">that um like if a bunch of rich people</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">get together and start a community like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">wait who&#39;s gonna who&#39;s gonna take the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">compost out not me i&#39;m rich like not me</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">like having the or or that also goes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">tasks that you like to do fucking</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">everyone else to listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">and yeah i just i really love the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">intergenerational part of communities</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">like only children lord of the flies</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">that would be</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">mixed reaction to that one because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">kind of depends on what level or what</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">type of community</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about here uh</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">goals and different health levels</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">of well are you trying to create a</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">to champion a diversity</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">uh as a core hallmark of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">community but</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">um you know communities the</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">ends of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">either force diversity right like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">going to try and find people that are so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">unrelated how do you even get along or</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">entire community clones of myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">well would that ever be a nightmare like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">i&#39;d have to deal with my own shit</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">constantly and no one would want to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">what i don&#39;t want to do because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">want to do the exact same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">like both ends of them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">i feel like you&#39;ve got a sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">hardships and ableness</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">in there for example like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">yeah if you had a community of of mostly</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">uh wealthy people and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">some of their ideas required folks to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">able to spend money to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">do a thing you&#39;re gonna leave people out</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">extra money to spend um so that might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">like decisions</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">you&#39;re having when you&#39;re going into it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">um you know i think if i&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">like more of like an</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">off-grid community that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">uh is gonna be more inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">um just having sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">to that there might be situations where</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">some people might</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">feel left out um and i&#39;m thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">ableness like everybody&#39;s got people</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">have different</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">disabilities and things that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">and so yeah like a high inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">some kind of game b off grid thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">is gonna have to be sensitive to that i</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">think um</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">if it&#39;s really gonna work and then i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">got like</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing there</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">there was a um short story</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">i read in in high school and i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">remember what the name of it is but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">you um for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">handicap everyone who isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">and uh and like that&#39;s kind of whenever</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">i say i&#39;m making a world for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">like that&#39;s what they picture and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">like no it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">like you don&#39;t stop being intelligent so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">that other people feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">more intelligent you but you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">people wrong for not being intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">like you you work with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">people&#39;s individual um abilities</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">you can honor that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">yeah you need everyone to be i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">thinking of i know people who i kind of</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">murder ball that&#39;s not right at all but</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">similar harrison it&#39;s harrison bergeron</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">the dysotopian science fiction yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">you were</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">if you were more intelligent they</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">handicapped you so that everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">the same right</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">yeah there was like something in your</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">brain that would like</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">if you were a thinker it would make you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">go off if you were strong they had these</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">weights on you and then also like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">weights fall off i think when the guy</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">because he was he was super strong but</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">um there&#39;s something in that of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">like if you forced everyone to play</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">hockey in a wheelchair</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">the people who are used to being in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">wheelchair could have a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">than like it&#39;s hard to use that right</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s a hard piece of equipment to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">learn to use and now all of a sudden we</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">all have to use it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">there absolutely needs to be space for</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">everyone to be able to play the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">the sports and the hobbies and the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">that you want requiring that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">like the forged diversity</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">or the everyone&#39;s exactly the same both</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">of those are poison</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">it&#39;s finding the like beautiful magic</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">in the diversity of like right we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">what do you need to be able to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">what do both as an individual and as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">community because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">the same right that if i can help you</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">succeed at your highest level</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get you at your highest</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">level if i have to tell you what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">highest level is right like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">bar you have to meet it</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">and if you&#39;re not there then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">get to be part of the community</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">even that would probably work better</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">than like pretending you can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">the community and then not actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">making any kind of accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">and just making you feel bad that you</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">uh that you can fail relating to money</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">um requiring it needing it setting it up</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">so that it&#39;s the backbone of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">you know maybe original point of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">community was</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">uh and turns that into a um</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">a bad um incentive landscape a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.839" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">yeah i mean corruption can come into uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about monetary needs and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">funding needs and when you said</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">corruption i was like oh yeah well that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">could pop up</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">in many different areas</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">um so yeah one way to fail is to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">some corruption in there one way to fail</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">is to not i would think</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">let&#39;s see i didn&#39;t come into this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">thinking a lot ahead of time about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">you know you could fail by not having</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">good ways to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">vet people to keep out corruption</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">i mean if someone&#39;s enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">sociopath you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">never be able to like stop them from you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">getting in but um</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">you could completely fail to have ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">to to vet people</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">i think that&#39;s um like ignoring humanity</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">ignoring what humanity is either with</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">um ignoring that we have the pareto</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">distribution there&#39;s gonna be people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">contribute more and people who should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">less and so like making that a mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">everyone contributes the same across the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">board the exact same way</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">um or financially right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">this amount of money in which can work</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">or not but like not having those things</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">written out not</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">like there&#39;s no sociopaths in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">like i&#39;m not even gonna think about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">like no one no everyone is perfect and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">not owning that humanity is we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">have some issues including</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">not having conflict resolution not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">allowing conflict</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s all simmering under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">and not having a way</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">to deal with that a way to be like okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">how do you bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">issues to light in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">respectful and not letting it get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:21.839" style="s2">that boiling point</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">the lack the lack of conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.839" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">and norms that by itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">can trigger a failure no matter how good</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">you are at</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">screening or onboarding or interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">people</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">no no okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">um listening all of you i i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:09.640" style="s2">my relation to failure in general</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.640" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">i have to say that i have a very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">to failure for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">it is a kind of exception i</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">i see a standard the standard a routine</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">process which is like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">like it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">accepted common sense to do this in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">and uh most of the time something is</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">labeled failure</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">uh when it doesn&#39;t work like it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">before so it is a kind of exception</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">but um i see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">failure or this field of failures</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">as the only area of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">and related to the topic community</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">for me is a free</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">speech place</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">an area for trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">something and failing is a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">important part of community life</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">so my relation to failure is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s positive one of the biggest ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">we would fail is to not allow failure</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">not allow a space to allow that not try</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">new things and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">remain stagnant yeah that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">safe to fail has been the phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard and used a lot for that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.000" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">not making it</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">safe to fail</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">yeah we have a saint in our community</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">which is safe enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">and that of course means that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">trying it see if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">fails or not right like you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">know we can think about it all we want</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">is it safe enough to try right like</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">drinking bleach not safe enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">but using this new product trying this</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">new system</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">safe enough to try which means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">an option to fail</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">are they like safe enough to fail or</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">what was the one what it wasn&#39;t safe it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">was what was it james</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">are safe to fail and then safe to try</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">yeah well uh so we got a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">list going</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">um i really like that last point another</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">that i can think of is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">from what i can tell you need a balance</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">um being having spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">you&#39;re listening you&#39;re doing maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">a community check-ins um</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">relational check-ins healing types of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">and kind of like the the doing types of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to you know we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">logistical uh things that just need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">be done</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">carpentry type of stuff you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">roof has a leak</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">somebody&#39;s got to fix it or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">i think you could fail by being way too</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">on one end of those um i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">my personal experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">uh places i&#39;ve been in tend to go too</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">far into the doing it&#39;s like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">doing here let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">do with our hands and move around and do</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">everything and very little</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">relational check-in how is everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">everybody getting their needs met</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">and you know etc that whole type of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">so you need to be balanced with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">there i think you can fail</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">by being way too far on either one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">yeah being and doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">as one way i&#39;ve heard of that i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">also heard the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">of the balance of face to face</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">and shoulder to shoulder in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">shoulder shoulder you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">uh together face to face here you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">so having a culture where you say hey</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve been getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">done but let&#39;s do uh you know a two-hour</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">check in uh stuff like that you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">really fail i think if you left that out</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">people working alongside one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">you could go for weeks or months like</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t have um</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">mechanisms i usually think of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">hey at the least if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">mechanisms for people to pause and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">ways to check in and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">and have conversations like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">you&#39;re going to end up i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t want to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">especially some kind of off-grid</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">community where we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">doing that on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">also having um the community like only</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">having common space having nowhere you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">can retreat to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">to be by yourself or to get that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">alone time</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">or having only alone time because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">clearly not a community</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">uh bad acoustics would make it makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">really bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">community so being able to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">neighbors having a common meal space for</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s just so loud you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">is a great way to fail because as much</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">as you want to have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">when all of the background noise is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">going on and good fences make good</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">neighbors good acoustics make good</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:23:00.679" style="s2">nice yeah i&#39;ll go back too to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">um i think say just a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.679" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">uh be one one sort of failure mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">and i mean this kind of in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">general sense maybe it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">leadership maybe it&#39;s norms and rules</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s the community as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">but uh lack of self-awareness um</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">just kills your i guess they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">and ability to grow and flex</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">and a community is always kind of moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">and shifting and changing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">the dynamics and self-awareness a high</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">degree of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">uh i think is usually required for</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">success over time in adapting</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">to things</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">can you break that down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">more like what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">can you give some examples of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">like failure modes like what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">happening over time</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">yeah i mean many of the specific things</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">that we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">might kind of fall abstractly are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">authoritarian leader who controls too</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">much like</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that because they think</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">you know that&#39;s going to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">but you know with greater self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">they realize they&#39;re sabotaging their</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">own community</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">and the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">conflict resolution procedures</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">uh you know everybody may feel better in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">the moment if they push the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">down or if they don&#39;t address conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">and just stuff it down</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">uh but uh greater self-awareness like oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">well this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">this is going to bubble up and bubble up</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">and boil until it it blows up</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">um so yeah kind of abstract but just</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">uh very much a thematic element in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">mind to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">lots of different failure types so</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">one of the things that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">when you said that is being open to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">um you know if if i&#39;m in community with</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">folks and we&#39;re really close</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">we need to open ourselves up to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">taking advice from one another and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">taking criticism</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">uh in a healthy way based on how much we</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">trust one another</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">so a lack of being open to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">uh yeah could really move into uh you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">i think you can only be so self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">and you can like work on it as much as</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">you can but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">there are parts of it where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">relying on the people around you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">to help you say hey you don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">um and yeah we really need each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">for that absolutely it&#39;s a group</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">that self-awareness at a community level</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">which then goes right back to the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">safety point</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">of safe to fail safe to try you know is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">to apply to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">speech acts and relationships and</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">uh and all of that so yeah it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">be um</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">yeah open space for honesty</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">transparency uh there may be norms</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">of acceptance and interaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">that really facilitate that and make</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">a strong constant lived uh thing because</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">it&#39;s uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">um oh which reminds me i was just</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">thinking like oh because people coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">into the community</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">are going to come in with not that norm</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">very much the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">of that norm and they&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">in be quiet uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">not feel comfortable giving feedback as</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">the new you know new person</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">um but just the the um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">so the the thing that rift off of there</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">for me was</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">um a community can fail if it um doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">champion</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">its culture and doesn&#39;t hold its culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">such that as it grows the community the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">the culture gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">uh dissipated dissolved uh regression to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">norm regression to the mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">uh as more and more people come in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">bring outside culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">into the community uh intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">whole you know if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">intentionally hold that culture and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">almost not indoctrinate but</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">you know champion and preserve and uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">grow that uh their their specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">culture then they will lose it and fail</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">yeah and and to add to that i really</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">love that hold your culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">intentionally thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">um otherwise yeah it will</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">it will dissipate over time i would also</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">add</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">uh you would probably fail if you had no</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">onboarding process</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">now sure if you had a closed group and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">you said okay we&#39;ve got these 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">this is it or we&#39;ve got these hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">people like this is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">uh you might not need that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">but say you did</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">a desire to grow you have to do some</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">kind of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">some kind of onboarding process the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">that people are just going to show up</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">you know especially if you have some</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">kind of radical group</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">where things are very outside the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">default world</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">people aren&#39;t gonna intuitively know</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">certain things</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">um you may need to tell people hey</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">here&#39;s the medical person by the way if</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">you get a cut or something like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">where you go for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">you know you&#39;re you&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">of society probably and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">from what i&#39;ve learned um</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">onboarding certain people love doing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s kind of um i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">this is just an anecdote but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">noticed that it&#39;s kind of exhausting for</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">some people</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">they just want to move in to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">and do the thing they set out to do um</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">onboarding oh i got to teach somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">new how long is this going to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">is it going to take weeks for them to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">get it uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">onboarding for certain personality types</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:10.159" style="s2">they just want to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">the main thing it can be exhausting for</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.159" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">some people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">making those people do the onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">sounds like a great way to fail</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">the person who really knows i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">know but i think also having that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">um membrane that isn&#39;t permeable so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">there is only even if it&#39;s 100 people</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">right these hundred people we&#39;ve started</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">children unless there&#39;s like a way if</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">you feel like you have to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">because if you leave you can&#39;t come back</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">you could maybe fail by not having</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">would be but you know um if</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">or as soon as something happened because</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">you would want some kind of justice</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">maybe the consequence isn&#39;t that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">kicked out maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">but if there&#39;s zero consequences for</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">then anyone who was stolen from would be</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">i&#39;m out like this doesn&#39;t even make</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">sense anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:36.840" style="s2">with that not honoring trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">like not seeing that there is never</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.840" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">like consequences come with trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">both ways right if the consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">too much you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">well what does stealing mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">you know if a four-year-old takes</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">another kid&#39;s toys you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">like being clear and also knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">there&#39;s room for growth right that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know what you would do when</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">someone stole because you didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">it was going to happen and then it comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">up and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">figuring out how to how to actually deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">with it when i think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">one of the biggest trade-offs of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">community is community meetings</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s like to make everyone&#39;s voice</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">heard is an exhausting process and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">exhausting so it&#39;s like you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">it go on for days you can&#39;t have even go</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">on for hours</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">and you need to still have everyone be</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">heard you can&#39;t have some people</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">monopolizing and not</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">be dealing with the issues so having</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">even just naming that trade-off right is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">like okay well how can we get people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">voices heard without taking up hours of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">time then you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">you can own it but if you&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">no no we have to sit and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">that all the people who don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">that aren&#39;t being heard</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">right like they&#39;re silenced their need</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">for silence isn&#39;t being heard</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">can you explain what the trade-off is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">little bit more you&#39;re saying like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">trade-off for having consequences</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">is that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">deliberations is that what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">sorry i was they were two different</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">things but if you have consequences for</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">something there&#39;s going to be trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">right that if the consequence for</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">stealing is getting kicked out</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be different than if the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">consequence for stealing is having your</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">arms chopped off right like those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">different and so it&#39;s i i was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">because i was going off of that but more</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">of the consequences like the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">like i think about um occupy movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">and they have these beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">two person set or two sessions every day</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">and i was like oh my god these are hours</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">long and you didn&#39;t even attend the last</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">one and how do you like</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">continue on to the next one that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">are trade-offs there&#39;s only so much time</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">in a day there&#39;s only so much people we</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">can house there&#39;s only so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">to be able to if you just aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">allowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">to have those trade-offs like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">we can do it for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">then it&#39;s it&#39;s a way to fail it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">daniel i mean i feel like it also would</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">the the weight of the situation like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">if you have some kind of thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">like a club</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like not their livelihood at stake</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">is what i&#39;ve pers you know my anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">what i&#39;ve observed</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">but you&#39;re off grid or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">someone&#39;s getting all their food and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">shelter from your community</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">then you&#39;d have to deal with that in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">and i think that is actually a way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">fail that um was brought up in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">community i brought it up in game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">as well was when i asked who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">one of the families that have now left</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">one of the families is pretty christian</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a very integral part of who they</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">and when i asked them what what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">community would they want to seek if</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">they were to seek a new one</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">and he didn&#39;t answer christian community</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">and i was like really i&#39;m like i just</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">need to circle back to this why wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">you and he&#39;s like because elbow</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">like he&#39;s in his he&#39;s 40 now</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s not like he&#39;s probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">go through that teenage crisis of faith</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">but he&#39;s like what if i did then i would</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">lose my community and i would lose my</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">if it was around you know at the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">time and so having it two</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">and having it too insulated worse every</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">piece of your need is met by this</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">community right it&#39;s where you live it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">where your</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">livelihood is it&#39;s where every one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">your friends and family is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">then yeah that&#39;s a really high metric</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">both for doing something wrong and also</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">just for</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">thinking you might do something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">feeling like you might get kicked out</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">and and that is a that that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">a way to fail to have it you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">had game b and then all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">start questioning</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">game b community specifically and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">say you started questioning wait is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">gaming even a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">is it that you then get kicked out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">like no we actually want those people</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">like i can point out the other issues</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">and that that takes me back to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">family analogy</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">uh and to what extent is you know is any</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">given community like a family and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">what are the boundaries uh and what are</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">in and out points um</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">sorry try to try to phrase this the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">the concept of failure in terms of even</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">throwing around like communities failing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve mostly been thinking about that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">uh the community blows up or dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">uh almost everyone agrees that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">community didn&#39;t work and it blows up</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">and everybody walks away</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">uh is i guess my typical kind of failure</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">mode that i was thinking of there</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">but then yeah considering the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">failure mode</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">of well if people uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">leave or are ejected or</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">bounced out of a community</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">in the eyes of that person perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">community failed</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">for them and if you if you aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">that enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">um you know i&#39;ve seen places where a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">keeps going and doesn&#39;t dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">but changes in nature and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">loses a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">a lot of people a trit out of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">and that mass of people say oh that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">community failed</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer what it once was it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">longer fulfilling its</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">true mission it&#39;s been corrupted or</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">hijacked or whatever you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s another definition of failure and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">i suppose at some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">all about your perspective uh either</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">your perspective or just</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">the you start weighing the raw counts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">how many people think that it has or</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">hasn&#39;t failed</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">uh if the majority inside the community</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">says no this is it this is we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">the right thing we&#39;re keeping going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t include you or it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">include what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">uh or how you want to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">community well then okay is that failure</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">well it</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">depends if you&#39;re the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">minority there</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s helpful a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">to fail</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">especially in an intentional community</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">is to not learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">from all the other people who came</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">before like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">i&#39;m starting like i&#39;m starting something</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">completely new no one&#39;s ever done this</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">and not looking at why why did they fail</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">because there&#39;s been a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">intentional communities especially in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">the 60s and 70s and what was it about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">what made them successful and what made</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:35.810" style="s2">just ignore all of that and just like</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">nope reinvent the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.810" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">yeah there but um there can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">intentional communities where</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">the number of people in them is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">much smaller than the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">who have</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">passed through them uh you know who have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">spent time there</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">and have maybe moved on for one reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">or another</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s interesting to consider too</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">of like oh you could have this huge mass</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">on the outside that okay maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">useful for a time</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">and then they moved on or maybe not or</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">maybe they they would have been there</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">but the community wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">change or grow or adapt and so they had</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">to move on</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">uh you still look at that intentional</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">community and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">it&#39;s holding on doing things the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">that it has for the last 20 or 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">and meanwhile there&#39;s just this growing</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">mass of people uh that it&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">on the outside yeah what do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">you judge that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">and well yeah i suppose i suppose at one</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">point you know just</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">fail or not fail like is the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">question then to ask</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">it seems to me like you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">what yeah what your purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know failing or not</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">failing your right is like connected to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">some kind of metric</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s like if you had an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">and going back to like the being versus</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">type of thing it&#39;s like if your</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">community was said</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do community and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">you know uh raise so much money every</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">to give away or you know we have some</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">kind of mission</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">like you could have a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">you could still fail at your mission</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">or if or if your community was more</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">about just</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">being and you said if we can keep six</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">people together</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">minimum you know like and keep that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">with and not worry about the mission so</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">that would be more of like a we just</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">like those are different failure modes</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">based on what you set out to do um if</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">we want a community of 20 people just to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">be with no mission our mission is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">continue to be together and you did it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">for a few years and you only ever hit</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">12.</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">like then you you know you failed by</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">the standards that you set i i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">um i feel like in the game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">thing we&#39;re mostly talking about going</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">omni-win types of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">ways of navigating the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re still competing with one</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">another or you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">causing harm externalizing harm</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">like if it&#39;s game b we&#39;ve got to go back</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">to some of those core principles i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">um hey you could have a mission-based</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">large community but if you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">causing harm</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">to the environment let&#39;s say then uh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">not sure it&#39;s game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">anymore uh that&#39;s the thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">you know taking the larger ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">into effect</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">not taking like the planetary ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">the social one i was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">getting a um like a piece of land in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s cheaper than canada or the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">and yet having none of those people live</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">there having not no amount like not</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">learning the language</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:14.800" style="s2">not being part of that country just like</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">yep this is a plot of land that we like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.800" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna use it that way it would</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">be a good way to fail</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">even if you succeed</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">or fail fail the game b metrics even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">you have a successful community</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">because they&#39;re different things</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">yeah metrics or definitions</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">suppose there are a few assumptions that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">maybe come with the word community</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">itself that most people might build into</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">their definition of success but</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">free reign i mean to you success is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">whatever you define it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">to be uh and thus failure as well if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">define a community</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">as being like a family with an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">commitment uh to people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">you like any you know any rupture</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">break then of that is is a failure</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">that you you lost somebody you know no</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">matter what their transgression</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">that you weren&#39;t able to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">rehabilitate or restore or anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">versus um</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">yeah you can totally define success as</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">opposite like the archipelago model of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">everybody has their own little island</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">and you can go to whatever island you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">uh and flip between them or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">uh you know just you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">not the attachment um model</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">so lots of so much uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">space so much domain space out there uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">in terms of what communities can be um</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">so yeah successes and failures or rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">perhaps arbitrarily defined thing i</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">for me zooming in and zooming out like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">is it a success for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">to be very different and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">going to be my success in communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">not going to be someone else&#39;s success</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:03.599" style="s2">in the community</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">and then the community itself right are</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">we sustainable are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">how is our culture how is but then</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">zooming out even further can there be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">bigger meta community of you know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">you&#39;re not here this is not working for</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">you this is not working for us but</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">there&#39;s other people to take you on</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">like to to have one community can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">accept everyone right there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">dunbar limits and stuff but to say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a bigger infrastructure of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">that trades that that has could be even</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">successful because it&#39;s also dealing</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:36.839" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">humans as natural elements that that my</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">body forms itself every seven years but</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">i&#39;m still me</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel you know those cells and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">to be able to have a ever-changing</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">community that either it goes away but</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">the bigger one doesn&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">it&#39;s successful maybe the bigger one</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">does like there&#39;s failure on</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">yeah i like the idea of is there a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">difference between success</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">for the larger whole versus the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">the individual important to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">i mean i have a story of when i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">doing quite a bit of volunteering</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">a couple years ago and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">was also seeking friendships and there</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">was a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">good high quality volunteering community</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">and we did some good work however</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">um it wasn&#39;t meeting my need for</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">friendships</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">and as even though i was trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2">you know not for lack of trying it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">kind of built into the ethos of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">volunteering community</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">and i had to step away i could step back</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">at some point but my need for</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">friendships</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">became larger than my you know ability</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">and need to volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">um and it just wasn&#39;t meeting that need</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">they&#39;re still doing really good work</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">um but i had to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">my priorities uh and so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">like yeah this individual need hey it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t taking care of dan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">uh friendship needs despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">that they were doing other good things</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">and it still exists since they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">doing good things</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">but it gets complex when you get down to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">the individual</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">i want to mention that it&#39;s uh 10</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.200" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">minutes before the for the hour if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">want to kind of give</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">um wrapping up type</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">thoughts and as well as i would love to</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">speaking of failure</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">i always put out my video content like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">what i&#39;m gonna do for the next week on</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">sunday so there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.800" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">of because this is on monday we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">get as much participation because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">not doing it a week in advance</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">so if we could maybe come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">um topics for like the next two or three</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">and always kind of keep it that way so</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">that people know two or three weeks out</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">and not the day</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">before when the topic is i think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">would be that would be helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">just think about wrapping up the failure</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">part so we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">fail the last of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">as daniel was talking i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">that failing to meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">people&#39;s needs would be a great sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">capper</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.359" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">uh in terms of if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of tautologically the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">of a failure of a community of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">to commune together for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">to get some needs met and if it fails to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">meet those needs</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">the uber failure</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">me that ultimate failure is not trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">like if you&#39;re never if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:48.800" style="s2">always like i want to live in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">intentional community and you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.800" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">in there like you can&#39;t go through that</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">interpersonal work unless you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t go through that community work</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">unless you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">so not trying not doing something</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">towards it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">is the ultimate failure and the only one</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">i actually think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">no failure like just try and keep</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">honoring</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:18.800" style="s2">for me failure is opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">and i welcome failure</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.800" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">you mean it&#39;s not a failure if we just</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">keep talking about it for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">our lives</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">come on uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">i guess uh my final thought i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">made a pretty good list</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">uh that maybe can get put into</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">um you know whatever gets put out from</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">one of the important things for me on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">last note</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">is fun um the community better</p>

<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">uh if that isn&#39;t celebrated it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">all work i really like to have fun</p>
