<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">something from their past that may not</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">fit directly on their professional track</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">but might tell me something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:19.560" style="s2">about them as a person one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">I pulled out if I think it was your</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">LinkedIn profile was way back yonder you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:27.500" style="s2">were a musical talent scout and music</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">producer tell us a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.500" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">certainly early on I was a performer in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">the music industry</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">so I started pretty young in high school</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">I had some success with the band that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">was enough success that we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">tour around and open for folks in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">mid-atlantic region and so I got an</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">early exposure to that and then after</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">that petered off you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">there&#39;s only so many people in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">world who can have a permanent job in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">the music industry on the performance</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">side and so you kind of get to realize</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">what your upper limit is and I saw how</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">incredibly difficult it would be to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:11.510" style="s2">it that direction and so I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.940" style="s2">interested in being</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.510" end="00:02:16.010" style="s2">behind the scenes so I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:20.120" style="s2">consulting for some of those acts that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.010" end="00:02:24.170" style="s2">used to open for and so we went from</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.120" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">there basically into starting from those</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.170" end="00:02:30.830" style="s2">two to consulting for the record studios</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">that I knew in the area and then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.830" end="00:02:34.519" style="s2">started consulting for private</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:37.099" style="s2">individual acts I was telling them about</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.519" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">business management how to properly</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.099" end="00:02:41.890" style="s2">manage themselves I was also starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.150" style="s2">consult them on performance so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.890" end="00:02:46.730" style="s2">performance coaching to improve their</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.150" end="00:02:49.069" style="s2">stage presence things of that nature and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.730" end="00:02:51.109" style="s2">one thing led to another and so I ended</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.069" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">up consulting for a pretty wide range of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.109" end="00:02:56.989" style="s2">acts across all genres I got into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:02:59.450" style="s2">rave scene the hip-hop scene industrial</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.989" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">music pretty much anything you can think</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.450" end="00:03:06.859" style="s2">of and this was in the northeastern</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">region from about 1997 to about five</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.859" end="00:03:11.390" style="s2">years ago and so I got to see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">really interesting things and I got to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.390" end="00:03:16.130" style="s2">see the good in the bad and the ugly of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:19.069" style="s2">the music industry let&#39;s just put it</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.130" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">that way yeah I&#39;ve got a fair number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.069" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">friends who somehow managed to make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">as kind of barely holding on performers</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:28.130" style="s2">for you know like 40 and 50 year careers</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:30.859" style="s2">you get them started about the music</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.130" end="00:03:33.079" style="s2">industry not a pretty place</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.859" end="00:03:35.630" style="s2">let&#39;s get rolling here into the meat of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.079" end="00:03:37.819" style="s2">our program which are Roberts</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.630" end="00:03:39.290" style="s2">professional work and professional views</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.819" end="00:03:40.609" style="s2">and then later on we&#39;re gonna talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.290" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">little bit about how it might be applied</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.609" end="00:03:45.560" style="s2">to radical social change movements and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.480" style="s2">things of that sort first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.560" end="00:03:48.620" style="s2">comes out of looking at your work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.480" end="00:03:50.680" style="s2">things you&#39;ve written and things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.620" end="00:03:53.169" style="s2">referred to is that you are a neo</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.680" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">Schumpeterian is that fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.169" end="00:03:58.760" style="s2">absolutely I&#39;m weirded Badgers pride</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.510" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">yeah and you know I followed some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.760" end="00:04:02.810" style="s2">links you provided me and some links I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:05.870" style="s2">found particularly Carlota Perez</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.810" end="00:04:07.819" style="s2">seems to be a very articulate thinker</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.870" end="00:04:09.470" style="s2">and scholar in this field for our</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.819" end="00:04:12.019" style="s2">audience who are smart but not</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.470" end="00:04:15.319" style="s2">necessarily economists tell them what a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.019" end="00:04:19.340" style="s2">neo Shuppet Aryan is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.319" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">absolutely so the there&#39;s a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">Canon in economics and in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">mainstream Canon the two most discussed</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:32.630" style="s2">sides of that Canon are delineated by</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">macroeconomics and on the one side of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.630" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">that Canon you have the historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.979" style="s2">classical and neoclassical economists</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:43.639" style="s2">right and on the other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.979" end="00:04:45.650" style="s2">Canon you have the Keynesian and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.639" end="00:04:48.919" style="s2">best way to talk about it is the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.650" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">who believe in interfering with economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.919" end="00:04:54.229" style="s2">cycles and the people who don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:56.030" style="s2">there used to be debate about - about</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.229" end="00:04:58.780" style="s2">whether there were such things as</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.030" end="00:05:01.250" style="s2">business cycles or economic cycles or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.780" end="00:05:03.289" style="s2">recurring patterns in the economy that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:07.099" style="s2">you could interfere with to improve</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.289" end="00:05:09.770" style="s2">things or not and but after let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.099" end="00:05:12.259" style="s2">roughly the 1980s there became a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.770" end="00:05:14.599" style="s2">synthesis in mainstream right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.259" end="00:05:16.669" style="s2">idea was that you had to in some way</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.599" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">include the insights of both of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.669" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">camps into the mainstream now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.699" style="s2">third camp</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">interestingly enough the Schumpeterian</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.699" end="00:05:29.500" style="s2">camp and the Schumpeterian camp dates</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:33.590" style="s2">back to Joseph Schumpeter</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.500" end="00:05:35.419" style="s2">who in the 1920s through the 1950s was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:38.150" style="s2">one of the world&#39;s premier economists</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.419" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">and he was at Harvard University many</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.150" end="00:05:43.010" style="s2">people looked at him as the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">rival of john maynard keynes and he had</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.010" end="00:05:48.380" style="s2">a different perspective he came from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">historical perspective of economics he</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.380" end="00:05:52.930" style="s2">was trained in austria and so he had</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">some kinship to some of the austrian</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.930" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">heterodoxy in economics but he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:03.979" style="s2">create a new mainstream position and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:06.260" style="s2">a Schumpeter took a number of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.979" end="00:06:10.220" style="s2">insights of historical economists</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.260" end="00:06:13.490" style="s2">throughout the 1800s including some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.220" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">the the less popular comments of the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.490" end="00:06:18.320" style="s2">names like adam smith you know they sent</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">stuff that was deleted you know so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.320" end="00:06:23.240" style="s2">basically what he did is he focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:25.909" style="s2">the the cyclical behavior of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.240" end="00:06:27.960" style="s2">and he was putting out on his big</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.909" end="00:06:30.990" style="s2">treatise right around the same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.960" end="00:06:32.759" style="s2">that John Maynard Keynes was and Keynes</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.990" end="00:06:34.470" style="s2">kind of stole his Thunder because at</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.759" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">that time governments were looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.470" end="00:06:39.030" style="s2">theories about how to intervene in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:41.789" style="s2">economy and that&#39;s exactly what he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:44.220" style="s2">speaking to now what trumpeter was</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:47.160" style="s2">trying to do instead was to present an</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:49.259" style="s2">alternative mainstream perspective where</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.160" end="00:06:51.930" style="s2">he wanted to look at the economy from</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.259" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">the business perspective outward so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.930" end="00:06:54.900" style="s2">while all the other economists were</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.340" end="00:06:58.169" style="s2">looking from the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.900" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">policy wonks downward you know if if</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.169" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">you&#39;re a Keynesian you&#39;re thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:04.650" style="s2">terms of policy professionals who work</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.060" end="00:07:07.560" style="s2">for the government and they have their</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.650" end="00:07:09.300" style="s2">hand on certain levers like inflation</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.560" end="00:07:10.729" style="s2">and unemployment and so forth and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.300" end="00:07:13.740" style="s2">they&#39;re going to pull those levers right</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.729" end="00:07:17.070" style="s2">well in the Schumpeterian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.740" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">Joe was looking at the business outward</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.070" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">and thinking about what are the levers</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:24.150" style="s2">that businesses pull that affect the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:27.630" style="s2">economy right and from that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">he decided that it was much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.630" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">intelligent to describe the economy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:38.070" style="s2">terms of creative destruction waves of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:40.680" style="s2">change and now big no what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.070" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">that this it&#39;s not like Schumpeter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.680" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">work disappeared but it wasn&#39;t taken up</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">by the mainstream macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">community because it didn&#39;t give them</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:53.190" style="s2">nice little levers that they could</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:55.620" style="s2">easily control so the way it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.190" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">works in policy worlds is that theories</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:08:00.330" style="s2">are written to the policy person who has</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">the power over that issue grace and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">they looked at his theory in there like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:06.060" style="s2">well I&#39;m not sure I know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:09.300" style="s2">that but the business people immediately</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.060" end="00:08:11.729" style="s2">did and so ever since then shop Batarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.300" end="00:08:16.349" style="s2">economics has been dominant in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.729" end="00:08:18.719" style="s2">business schools but nowhere else and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.349" end="00:08:21.449" style="s2">it&#39;s been worked into all the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.719" end="00:08:23.310" style="s2">business theories in terms of strategy</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.449" end="00:08:25.979" style="s2">in terms of Business Economics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">business theory and it&#39;s all based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.979" end="00:08:30.810" style="s2">seeing the world is a symphony of cycles</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.159" end="00:08:33.899" style="s2">basically you have business cycles you</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.810" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">have no tenure cycles two-year cycles</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.899" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">50-year cycles various different lengths</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">and intervals and each one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:44.810" style="s2">cycles is determined by real</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">duck t&#39;v concerns for example when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.810" end="00:08:51.259" style="s2">have to build a new plant you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:53.000" style="s2">think 10 years in advance as to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.259" end="00:08:54.589" style="s2">that investment is going to do for you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.000" end="00:08:57.639" style="s2">you have to have a very long term</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.589" end="00:09:00.379" style="s2">horizon perspective and those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.639" end="00:09:03.439" style="s2">economic decisions that businesses make</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.379" end="00:09:05.750" style="s2">are always going to be made in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.439" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">well what&#39;s everybody else doing what am</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.750" end="00:09:08.810" style="s2">i doing what is everybody else doing are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">we all building plants at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.810" end="00:09:12.110" style="s2">or are we all you know being</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:14.149" style="s2">conservative about our investments at</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.110" end="00:09:16.579" style="s2">the same time and the argument is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.149" end="00:09:18.740" style="s2">when the herd makes plans that move in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.579" end="00:09:22.819" style="s2">the same direction at the same time you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.740" end="00:09:24.620" style="s2">have cycles a and B you have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.819" end="00:09:26.389" style="s2">cost problem where pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.620" end="00:09:28.189" style="s2">everything in business involves a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.389" end="00:09:30.740" style="s2">cost investment and then a variable cost</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.189" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">investment and the fixed cost investment</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.740" end="00:09:36.620" style="s2">is going to be causing you cycles</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:41.420" style="s2">because you have to basically plan for</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.620" end="00:09:43.459" style="s2">these big sunk costs and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.420" end="00:09:45.709" style="s2">to plan the lifecycle of that project</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.459" end="00:09:47.809" style="s2">right so pretty much everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.709" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">business thinks in terms of project</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.809" end="00:09:51.050" style="s2">management and project life cycles and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:54.230" style="s2">that&#39;s why it all goes back to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.050" end="00:09:55.670" style="s2">Schumpeterian perspective that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.230" end="00:09:58.639" style="s2">lot of sense I noticed that Carlota</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.670" end="00:10:01.850" style="s2">Perez then takes that to be a basis for</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.639" end="00:10:03.730" style="s2">looking at large-scale you know operates</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.850" end="00:10:06.079" style="s2">in the same general space as long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.730" end="00:10:08.290" style="s2">macroeconomics and and particularly she</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:10.069" style="s2">talks a lot about you know five main</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.290" end="00:10:12.620" style="s2">transitions since the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.069" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">Revolution and how we are probably at</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.620" end="00:10:18.379" style="s2">the cusp of the fifth one could you tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:20.600" style="s2">us a little bit about that absolutely so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.379" end="00:10:23.779" style="s2">let me talk about Carlota Perez a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">bit because I think she&#39;s amazing so</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.779" end="00:10:30.019" style="s2">basically we had this state of affairs</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.639" style="s2">right when she came onto the scene in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.019" end="00:10:34.790" style="s2">the 1980s we did a state of affairs</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.639" end="00:10:36.559" style="s2">where there was people working in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.790" end="00:10:38.779" style="s2">business were thinking outwardly from</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.559" end="00:10:40.670" style="s2">what their perspective and then people</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.779" end="00:10:42.559" style="s2">working in macroeconomics we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.670" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">thinking downward from their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.559" end="00:10:47.209" style="s2">and what she did is she took she was</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:48.769" style="s2">working with a guy named Chris Freeman</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.209" end="00:10:50.569" style="s2">at that time and Chris Freeman at</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.769" end="00:10:52.730" style="s2">University of Sussex was one of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.569" end="00:10:54.439" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure he was there was one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.730" end="00:10:54.710" style="s2">these interdisciplinary guys who was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.439" end="00:10:56.390" style="s2">trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.710" end="00:10:59.210" style="s2">break down the barriers between these</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.390" end="00:11:04.490" style="s2">different camps and Perez came along and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.210" end="00:11:09.140" style="s2">she very clearly had a vision of how</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.490" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">industrial revolutions were the core of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.140" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">the Schumpeterian economic theory what</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:18.080" style="s2">she did is she went back and she looked</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:21.980" style="s2">at this old work on long cycles back in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.080" end="00:11:25.540" style="s2">the late 1800s there was a Russian name</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.980" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">conned writing and chondrite Eve was</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.540" end="00:11:31.160" style="s2">studying long cycles in world history</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:36.350" style="s2">and what he found is what he thought was</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.160" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">roughly a 50/50 five-year cycle in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.350" end="00:11:44.810" style="s2">global GDP and so in the global world</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:47.930" style="s2">system he saw this this GDP cycle and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.810" end="00:11:49.310" style="s2">he was doing work on this and he he made</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.930" end="00:11:52.910" style="s2">the argument that every time there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.310" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">an Industrial Revolution there was sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.910" end="00:11:58.310" style="s2">of a boom bust in terms of global output</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.530" style="s2">and so at first the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.310" end="00:12:04.640" style="s2">Revolution is going to start at a bus</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.530" end="00:12:07.070" style="s2">point because when you&#39;re first</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.640" end="00:12:09.980" style="s2">producing innovations they haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.070" end="00:12:12.680" style="s2">caught fire they haven&#39;t yet reached</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.980" end="00:12:15.560" style="s2">saturation so you&#39;re throwing all this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.680" end="00:12:18.110" style="s2">money at radical new technologies but</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.560" end="00:12:21.020" style="s2">during that period you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.110" end="00:12:24.020" style="s2">financial rewards for those investments</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.020" end="00:12:25.550" style="s2">yet right so you started a bust when</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.020" end="00:12:29.030" style="s2">there&#39;s an industrial revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.550" end="00:12:31.730" style="s2">then it very quickly up swings and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.030" end="00:12:34.280" style="s2">over the next 25 or so years you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.730" end="00:12:36.680" style="s2">going to have a sustained up boom and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.280" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">then eventually you&#39;re going to hit that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.680" end="00:12:40.280" style="s2">saturation point where all of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.810" end="00:12:43.310" style="s2">investment opportunities for that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.280" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">industrial revolution have been have</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.310" end="00:12:47.720" style="s2">been tapped and so you have diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:51.500" style="s2">returns and then you go into a downswing</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.720" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">and so he made this argument and shot</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.500" end="00:12:56.330" style="s2">butter was toying with with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:58.220" style="s2">argument as well but Carlota Perez</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.330" end="00:13:01.220" style="s2">basically said we need to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.220" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">this because we have fresh evidence from</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:07.970" style="s2">the 1970s of a new industrial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:08.600" style="s2">that followed that pattern there was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.970" end="00:13:10.610" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.600" end="00:13:12.410" style="s2">we&#39;re because of the World War one and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.610" end="00:13:14.420" style="s2">World War two that pattern had been</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.410" end="00:13:17.660" style="s2">disrupted and so a lot of people thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.420" end="00:13:19.579" style="s2">well you know that was pre-world War one</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.660" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">there was this world system pattern</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.579" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">where there was this swing after World</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">War one that ended we&#39;re in a new era</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:29.690" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer gonna have these long</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:32.449" style="s2">cycles like chondrite had predicted but</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.690" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">Perez said I don&#39;t think so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.449" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">we had a military disruption of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.029" end="00:13:40.310" style="s2">pattern and now we&#39;re back on track and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:42.019" style="s2">so she made the argument that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.310" end="00:13:44.630" style="s2">go back to looking at industrial</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.019" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">revolutions as these periodic cycles and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.630" end="00:13:50.899" style="s2">the evidence was astoundingly good so</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:54.589" style="s2">she almost seen her and Chris Freeman</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.899" end="00:13:57.019" style="s2">actually I would say as a duo we opened</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.589" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">the line of inquiry into the chondrite</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.019" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">of cycles and they came up with a novel</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">explanation for it by late but they did</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:07.209" style="s2">a review of all the research that had</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:09.529" style="s2">been done recently on historical</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.209" end="00:14:11.269" style="s2">economics and they came up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.529" end="00:14:14.389" style="s2">model and that new model was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.269" end="00:14:16.930" style="s2">multi-level multi-sector model that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.389" end="00:14:19.399" style="s2">would then be useful and forward-looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.930" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">predictions of future industrial</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.399" end="00:14:26.509" style="s2">revolutions and the model ended up</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:28.819" style="s2">fitting so well that even though this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.509" end="00:14:31.430" style="s2">was considered a heterodox theory in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.819" end="00:14:34.759" style="s2">recent years there&#39;s been a huge boom in</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.430" end="00:14:37.370" style="s2">interest in this industrial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.759" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">pattern and so now we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.370" end="00:14:43.310" style="s2">almost an academic gold rush of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:45.529" style="s2">who are suddenly noticing how strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.310" end="00:14:47.750" style="s2">that pattern is and how useful it is for</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.529" end="00:14:51.889" style="s2">making for looking predictions for this</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.750" end="00:14:55.930" style="s2">century and so I&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.889" end="00:14:59.899" style="s2">participating in putting together an</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.930" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">interdisciplinary set of work designs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.899" end="00:15:05.779" style="s2">forecast at least the next 50 years with</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">her theory is one of the base theories</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.779" end="00:15:10.100" style="s2">for that forecasting project</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">what&#39;s hearth area where we are today</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.100" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">and what Epoque are we absolutely so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.260" style="s2">let me first mention she&#39;s at London</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.260" style="s2">School of Economics which is the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.260" end="00:15:22.810" style="s2">place that David Graeber is</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.260" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of really high-profile</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.810" end="00:15:27.640" style="s2">heterodox folks at London School of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.850" end="00:15:29.650" style="s2">Economics so that&#39;s a top five economics</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.640" end="00:15:32.170" style="s2">institution she&#39;s also visiting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.650" end="00:15:34.330" style="s2">other places Oh Tom Piketty is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.170" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">visiting there so these people know each</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.330" end="00:15:38.200" style="s2">other you know what I mean so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:41.950" style="s2">like she&#39;s in some sort of weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.200" end="00:15:45.730" style="s2">periphery in the economics world and she</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.950" end="00:15:48.940" style="s2">wrote a book in 2002 about financials</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.730" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">cycles and about an upcoming economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.940" end="00:15:54.760" style="s2">crisis right so in 2002 she gave her</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.380" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">explanation of the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.760" end="00:16:01.090" style="s2">revolutions and then she talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:03.250" style="s2">how there was a basically a crash period</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.090" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">basically you have an emergence in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.250" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">growth period and then you have a crash</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">and then you restore from that crash and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:13.750" style="s2">you go into a golden age and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.830" end="00:16:15.700" style="s2">maturity period of that revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.750" end="00:16:21.610" style="s2">so what she argued is that we were up</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.700" end="00:16:24.370" style="s2">coming to a crash around 28 2008 2010</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.610" end="00:16:26.770" style="s2">and she turned out to be correct</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.370" end="00:16:28.180" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of funny because several</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.770" end="00:16:30.190" style="s2">different people all claim to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.180" end="00:16:32.650" style="s2">predicted the financial crisis using</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.190" end="00:16:34.660" style="s2">completely different theories right you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.650" end="00:16:36.550" style="s2">know you have the gold bugs thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.660" end="00:16:38.410" style="s2">that they predicted it you have certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.550" end="00:16:41.200" style="s2">Canton&#39;s like Paul Krugman thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.410" end="00:16:43.480" style="s2">he predicted it but the thing is they</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.200" end="00:16:45.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t have deep explanations well most</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.480" end="00:16:47.980" style="s2">of them did some did for instance one</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.760" end="00:16:50.740" style="s2">guy I follow very closely John Jena</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.980" end="00:16:54.100" style="s2">Coppola from Yale he nailed it he</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.740" end="00:16:57.190" style="s2">published a paper in the 2006 analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:16:59.650" style="s2">the leverage cycle and he was showing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.190" end="00:17:02.410" style="s2">hey we are heading into a very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.650" end="00:17:06.430" style="s2">time when everything is getting levered</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.410" end="00:17:08.980" style="s2">up this cannot end well yes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.430" end="00:17:12.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point so that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.980" end="00:17:15.840" style="s2">those cycles right so glad that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.070" end="00:17:19.690" style="s2">brought that up because this system of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.840" end="00:17:22.450" style="s2">worldview involves incorporating all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.690" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">the best knowledge of cycles that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.450" end="00:17:26.740" style="s2">have and that is one of those cycles</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.650" style="s2">that&#39;s in real business cycle models is</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.740" end="00:17:31.570" style="s2">leverage cycles because the argument</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.650" end="00:17:32.890" style="s2">there is that basically there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.570" end="00:17:35.080" style="s2">a momentum pattern</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.890" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">we&#39;re basically financial cycles swing</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.080" end="00:17:40.570" style="s2">more aggressively than business cycles</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.190" style="s2">do and so you always know that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.570" end="00:17:43.900" style="s2">having a business cycle swing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.190" end="00:17:46.690" style="s2">going to be having a more exaggerated</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.900" end="00:17:48.340" style="s2">financial cycle swing and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.690" end="00:17:51.400" style="s2">can predict like you said looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.340" end="00:17:52.690" style="s2">leverage where you are in that cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.400" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.690" end="00:17:57.550" style="s2">things stack together so her model</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:18:01.420" style="s2">basically said look we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.550" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">facing this financial crisis and here</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.420" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">are all of the levels of concerns that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:09.700" style="s2">we have but the more important thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.850" end="00:18:11.770" style="s2">that she was trying to stress is why do</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.700" end="00:18:14.790" style="s2">you even have a leveraged cycle you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.770" end="00:18:17.500" style="s2">why would you even have these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.790" end="00:18:19.240" style="s2">monetary or economic cycles unless there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.500" end="00:18:22.270" style="s2">was something real underlying it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.240" end="00:18:24.820" style="s2">the argument and so she was able to give</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.270" end="00:18:26.740" style="s2">a pretty good explanation and the her</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.820" end="00:18:28.540" style="s2">book got a lot of attention and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.740" end="00:18:30.490" style="s2">question then becomes how did she do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.540" end="00:18:32.050" style="s2">predicting everything since that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.490" end="00:18:35.050" style="s2">and the argument is it&#39;s still working</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.050" end="00:18:38.260" style="s2">very well with their Harry so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.050" end="00:18:41.410" style="s2">certain sense that the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:46.660" style="s2">going to move forward in Neosho</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.410" end="00:18:48.670" style="s2">criterion economics is to try to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.660" end="00:18:50.620" style="s2">the best knowledge of what all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.670" end="00:18:53.650" style="s2">various independent economists are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.620" end="00:18:56.380" style="s2">working on that has a cyclical format</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:18:58.150" style="s2">and then trying to unify those cycles</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.380" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">and to understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.150" end="00:19:04.150" style="s2">between them if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">yep Andy that&#39;s a very good description</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.150" end="00:19:09.040" style="s2">she also makes a point that in her view</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:11.800" style="s2">we have the opportunity though not the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.040" end="00:19:13.390" style="s2">guarantee of entering a new golden age</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.800" end="00:19:16.900" style="s2">could you tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.390" end="00:19:19.540" style="s2">that absolutely so each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.900" end="00:19:22.570" style="s2">industrial revolutions as I said has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.540" end="00:19:25.480" style="s2">similar structure to it and if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:28.180" style="s2">gotten five in a row with the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.480" end="00:19:30.190" style="s2">structure more or less I mean the only</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.180" end="00:19:32.440" style="s2">exception was there were some variation</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.190" end="00:19:35.290" style="s2">around world war one world war two which</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.440" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">was basically the fourth Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.290" end="00:19:39.550" style="s2">Revolution was disrupted a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.760" end="00:19:42.100" style="s2">but other than that barring a world war</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.550" end="00:19:44.350" style="s2">type of scenario we&#39;re looking at a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.100" end="00:19:45.870" style="s2">similar structure for the next 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.350" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.870" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">can the qualitative aspects of each</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:54.270" style="s2">Industrial Revolution are different and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:56.299" style="s2">so you have to update each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.270" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">industrial revolutions with a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.299" end="00:20:02.549" style="s2">qualitative understanding of how the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:05.370" style="s2">industries are going to unfold and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.549" end="00:20:08.539" style="s2">so forth but structurally we we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.370" end="00:20:11.669" style="s2">expect pretty much the same thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.539" end="00:20:13.559" style="s2">going into the next 50 years she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.669" end="00:20:15.480" style="s2">looking at the very first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.559" end="00:20:18.419" style="s2">we&#39;re going to experience is the digital</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.480" end="00:20:21.870" style="s2">golden age okay so the digital</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.419" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">revolution began in the 1970s according</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.870" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">to her mom and because of that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:30.120" style="s2">basically my house trying to say this</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">just because there&#39;s an industrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.120" end="00:20:35.159" style="s2">revolution every 50 years doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">that the old one dies at exactly 50</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.159" end="00:20:39.450" style="s2">years right so just because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:42.270" style="s2">Industrial Revolution started in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.450" end="00:20:44.070" style="s2">1970s surrounding the digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.270" end="00:20:46.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.070" end="00:20:49.740" style="s2">abruptly dies you know 50 years later</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.980" end="00:20:53.820" style="s2">what happens is that there&#39;s an overhang</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.740" end="00:20:56.970" style="s2">and so as the digital revolution goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.820" end="00:21:00.330" style="s2">into a maturity phase which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:03.049" style="s2">what we&#39;re expecting right now so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.330" end="00:21:07.110" style="s2">digital paradigm enters a maturity phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.049" end="00:21:09.539" style="s2">then there&#39;s going to be an overlap</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.110" end="00:21:13.049" style="s2">between the upswing of the new</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.539" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">Industrial Revolution and the sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.049" end="00:21:18.360" style="s2">of the current one and during that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">overlap period you&#39;re going to see a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.360" end="00:21:24.630" style="s2">golden age of technology where you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:26.940" style="s2">the benefits of both you get you get the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.630" end="00:21:29.480" style="s2">sustained economic productivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.940" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">prior plus the promise of the new</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.480" end="00:21:36.120" style="s2">productivity right and so under this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">prediction we&#39;ve already been there</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.120" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">right that&#39;s part of the long prolonged</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:42.929" style="s2">economic boom that we&#39;ve had under the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.770" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">trump administration he can&#39;t claim</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.929" end="00:21:48.929" style="s2">credit for that right it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:52.350" style="s2">been caused by the ordinary progress of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.929" end="00:21:54.750" style="s2">technology okay so the only thing he can</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.350" end="00:21:56.789" style="s2">do is not screw it up you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.750" end="00:21:57.549" style="s2">the president&#39;s job is to not screw up</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.789" end="00:22:00.340" style="s2">or deny</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.549" end="00:22:01.929" style="s2">get in the way of the economy and so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.340" end="00:22:03.789" style="s2">can debate how well he&#39;s doing about</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.929" end="00:22:06.639" style="s2">that you know that&#39;s a separate story</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.789" end="00:22:09.820" style="s2">but the argument is that over the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.639" end="00:22:12.210" style="s2">10-15 years we should expect the digital</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:16.119" style="s2">technology to continue to drive us</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.210" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2">through a golden age then what will</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.119" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">happen is at the end of that golden age</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:26.399" style="s2">stretch we&#39;re going to find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:28.779" style="s2">into a new major crisis period and so if</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.399" end="00:22:30.909" style="s2">disciples stay as they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.779" end="00:22:33.940" style="s2">traditionally we&#39;ve got a good 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.909" end="00:22:36.909" style="s2">to go before we enter the next major</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.940" end="00:22:40.299" style="s2">crisis and that&#39;s wonderful news now</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.909" end="00:22:43.809" style="s2">keep in mind that this model is is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.299" end="00:22:46.389" style="s2">including chaotic events or we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.809" end="00:22:47.259" style="s2">basically acts of God or viruses or</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.389" end="00:22:51.340" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.259" end="00:22:53.289" style="s2">so when you start looking at wars when</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.340" end="00:22:56.139" style="s2">you start looking at viruses and other</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.289" end="00:22:58.779" style="s2">sorts of things these can interrupts the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.139" end="00:23:01.210" style="s2">underlying business trajectories of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.779" end="00:23:02.950" style="s2">Industrial Revolution pattern these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.210" end="00:23:04.539" style="s2">the kinds of things that haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.950" end="00:23:07.059" style="s2">been added into the model and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.539" end="00:23:09.789" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t I know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.059" end="00:23:12.700" style="s2">sounds kind of funny but we can do far</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.789" end="00:23:15.429" style="s2">far better in adding a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.700" end="00:23:18.220" style="s2">other things we can add political events</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.429" end="00:23:20.889" style="s2">into the model we can add environmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.220" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">events into the model and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.889" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">necessarily mean that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">predict exactly when these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:32.619" style="s2">other events occur what you can do as</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you know you can predict your</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.619" end="00:23:37.659" style="s2">risk level and you can also predict your</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:40.629" style="s2">response and you can also prepare for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.659" end="00:23:44.529" style="s2">response and so if you understand how</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.629" end="00:23:47.379" style="s2">the ordinary economy works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.529" end="00:23:51.129" style="s2">sort of like the symphony of cycles then</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.379" end="00:23:54.009" style="s2">you can be prepared to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.129" end="00:23:57.399" style="s2">good or bad the timing is for those</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.009" end="00:23:58.419" style="s2">things how devastating they will be also</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.399" end="00:24:01.509" style="s2">whether or not they&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.419" end="00:24:04.210" style="s2">opportunity to restructure so one of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.509" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">claims right now is that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.210" end="00:24:10.380" style="s2">the Schumpeterian cycle patterns this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:15.810" style="s2">a very good good</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.380" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">time to exploit the Kovach 19 events for</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.810" end="00:24:20.910" style="s2">a creative destruction events - to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:24.540" style="s2">basically clear the path for some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.910" end="00:24:27.870" style="s2">these six generation technologies now</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.540" end="00:24:29.580" style="s2">this model may extend further back than</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.870" end="00:24:32.010" style="s2">the first Industrial Revolution let me</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.580" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">just put that caveat there the point is</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.010" end="00:24:36.540" style="s2">most people don&#39;t think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:38.130" style="s2">value in trying to do that so we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.540" end="00:24:41.000" style="s2">put a lot of effort into that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.130" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">usually the model starts in the 1770s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.000" end="00:24:46.440" style="s2">and the first Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:48.600" style="s2">where you have not only people usually</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.440" end="00:24:50.760" style="s2">think about the substance 1770s in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.600" end="00:24:52.890" style="s2">of political revolutions the United</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.760" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">States France and so forth but it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.890" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">also the revolution of steam power and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:25:02.220" style="s2">textile mills and and all the original</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">factories that started the coal mining</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.220" end="00:25:06.180" style="s2">and everything that started the march</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:09.660" style="s2">towards factories began roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.180" end="00:25:11.580" style="s2">1770s give or take and so the first year</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.660" end="00:25:13.410" style="s2">just a revolution was there and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.580" end="00:25:15.990" style="s2">fast-forward 50 years you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.410" end="00:25:18.030" style="s2">1820s Second Industrial Revolution you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.990" end="00:25:21.030" style="s2">have locomotives</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.030" end="00:25:22.700" style="s2">railroad you have the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.030" end="00:25:25.680" style="s2">corporation as we understand it today</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.700" end="00:25:26.100" style="s2">the limited liability approach and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.680" end="00:25:28.920" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">all went through the railroad boom in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.920" end="00:25:33.240" style="s2">England that&#39;s sort of that whole period</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:36.150" style="s2">if you also had modern media and things</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.240" end="00:25:37.350" style="s2">like that like academic journals most of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.150" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">them were born in that time period</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.350" end="00:25:42.330" style="s2">things like that so the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:44.490" style="s2">mechanical the second one started going</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.330" end="00:25:46.470" style="s2">into chemical innovations as some of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.490" end="00:25:48.810" style="s2">dominant of that period a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.470" end="00:25:50.970" style="s2">railroad stuff was was driven by</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.810" end="00:25:53.970" style="s2">discovery of thermodynamics and chemical</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.970" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">concepts third Industrial Revolution was</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.970" end="00:26:01.740" style="s2">the 1870s and that was a very famous</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:04.530" style="s2">Depression period where everyone said</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.740" end="00:26:07.290" style="s2">you have this sort of economic</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.530" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">depression but you have just hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.290" end="00:26:12.870" style="s2">inventions coming out and so everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:14.940" style="s2">from the typewriter to steam ships and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.870" end="00:26:17.310" style="s2">an international trade and so forth the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.940" end="00:26:19.230" style="s2">big one that era was agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.310" end="00:26:21.480" style="s2">innovation near the tractor and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.230" end="00:26:24.179" style="s2">Reaper and all that Oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.480" end="00:26:27.179" style="s2">yeah absolutely cotton gins and all that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.179" end="00:26:32.840" style="s2">good stuff and so you have you have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.179" end="00:26:35.460" style="s2">sweet in the 1870s then in the 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.840" end="00:26:39.390" style="s2">roughly although it came a little early</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.460" end="00:26:42.600" style="s2">you had a new boom around automobiles</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.390" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">the formal oil industry that was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.600" end="00:26:47.400" style="s2">fourth Industrial Revolution was roughly</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:50.130" style="s2">around World War one so basically then</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.400" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">that God had sent to also radio</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.130" end="00:26:54.510" style="s2">technology signal technology I like to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:56.160" style="s2">call it sort of the wave based</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.510" end="00:26:59.309" style="s2">Industrial Revolution where everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.160" end="00:27:03.750" style="s2">was driven by analog signals really and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.309" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">so then you had basically this mini</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.750" end="00:27:08.460" style="s2">Industrial Revolution that I like to add</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.090" end="00:27:10.020" style="s2">in here that was somewhat caused by</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.460" end="00:27:12.840" style="s2">World War one in World War two</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.020" end="00:27:15.090" style="s2">there was a it&#39;s a slight variation from</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.840" end="00:27:16.950" style="s2">the model you see a double dip a mini</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.090" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">industrial revolution around the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.950" end="00:27:22.650" style="s2">power phase right so basically the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">reason why it&#39;s a mini revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.650" end="00:27:29.460" style="s2">because it was a huge deal but it did we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:32.280" style="s2">did not allow those sorts of discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.460" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">to spread as far and wide a lot it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.280" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">kept under wraps and under tight</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">security you know when we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:41.160" style="s2">nuclear power it didn&#39;t end up filtering</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:44.040" style="s2">throughout the entire economy the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.160" end="00:27:45.870" style="s2">that automobiles did you know so it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.040" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">became sort of a mini industrial</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.870" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">revolution off to the side this nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:53.880" style="s2">revolution and it was in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:56.160" style="s2">stalled you know we&#39;re still we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.880" end="00:27:58.890" style="s2">have done a lot more with it than we</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.160" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">have up to today and you know and I know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.890" end="00:28:03.330" style="s2">that if we wanted to we could have gone</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:05.190" style="s2">down the route of France and we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.330" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">have thrown nuclear power up like it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.190" end="00:28:10.020" style="s2">candy and we may well yet do that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:12.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a right significant argument in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.020" end="00:28:14.070" style="s2">fact one I wrote a little mini article</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.390" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">on the fact that if we really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.070" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">get serious about climate change the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:20.400" style="s2">best place to start would be to multiply</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:22.200" style="s2">our nuclear fleet by about five x and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.400" end="00:28:25.190" style="s2">then augment that with about an equal</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.200" end="00:28:28.200" style="s2">amount of wind and photovoltaic</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.190" end="00:28:32.070" style="s2">especially small modular reactors and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.200" end="00:28:33.960" style="s2">the next-gen breeders right yep frankly</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.070" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">if you use the Chinese or the French</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.960" end="00:28:36.990" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">where you used standard plants knock</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.990" end="00:28:40.500" style="s2">them up in three or four years move the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:43.710" style="s2">regulatory bottlenecks out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:45.899" style="s2">they actually work now yeah even with</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.710" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">the current systems absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.899" end="00:28:51.260" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">would work better if we reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.260" end="00:28:57.330" style="s2">society not even in a drastic way but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">just in an ordinary way that we would in</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.330" end="00:29:02.309" style="s2">an industrial revolution cycle there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:04.740" style="s2">usually an infrastructure wave where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.309" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">try to diffuse that technology to its</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.740" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">fullest extent right and it just so</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:12.630" style="s2">happens that the only major industrial</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:14.539" style="s2">revolution opportunity we had where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.630" end="00:29:17.370" style="s2">intentionally pulled the plug on that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.539" end="00:29:19.950" style="s2">innovation diffusion pattern happen to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.370" end="00:29:20.820" style="s2">be nuclear actually I&#39;d say it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.950" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.820" end="00:29:25.769" style="s2">oh absolutely it was a complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:28.529" style="s2">interaction and that what ended up</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.769" end="00:29:31.260" style="s2">happening was that you know popular fear</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.529" end="00:29:32.789" style="s2">what was that movie that you know about</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.260" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">the meltdown or something right about</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.789" end="00:29:36.809" style="s2">the same time as Three Mile Island and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:38.490" style="s2">people got all freaked out and it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.809" end="00:29:40.710" style="s2">regulatory over a reaction which made</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">him too expensive right the real reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.710" end="00:29:46.380" style="s2">that the diffusion stopped in the late</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:48.840" style="s2">70s early 80s was that you know it sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.380" end="00:29:51.179" style="s2">of multi cycles of you know mass media</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.840" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">and just fear-mongering led to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.179" end="00:29:54.630" style="s2">over-regulation which then let the costs</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">and timelines getting to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.630" end="00:29:59.159" style="s2">no longer economically made any sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:01.169" style="s2">and so people backed away and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.159" end="00:30:03.870" style="s2">proves that the cultural side of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.169" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">equation is very important right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.870" end="00:30:07.740" style="s2">well do that by the way so we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.899" style="s2">back to that specific point because that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.740" end="00:30:12.419" style="s2">seems to be a clear point of the Neo</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.899" end="00:30:13.980" style="s2">shilpa Tyrian economics that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.419" end="00:30:16.919" style="s2">have to include all the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.980" end="00:30:18.659" style="s2">education media bureaucracy etc when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.919" end="00:30:21.750" style="s2">look at the old foldings of these cycles</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.659" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">yeah as an integrated system so and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.750" end="00:30:28.049" style="s2">let me so I&#39;ll finish the explanation so</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.330" end="00:30:30.690" style="s2">then the fifth paradigm came along and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.049" end="00:30:32.519" style="s2">roughly the 1970s and everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.690" end="00:30:35.100" style="s2">about Moore&#39;s Law and everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.519" end="00:30:37.350" style="s2">that we sort of declared ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.100" end="00:30:40.889" style="s2">new world when we had micro processors</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.350" end="00:30:42.179" style="s2">and semiconductors and so the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.889" end="00:30:44.870" style="s2">when you go back and you look at this</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.179" end="00:30:48.130" style="s2">pattern across these different paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.870" end="00:30:51.100" style="s2">there&#39;s an initial therm</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.130" end="00:30:54.610" style="s2">dynamic change basically some really</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.100" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">real changed in the physical economy</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.610" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">driven by a core technology or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:03.220" style="s2">technologies such as steam engines such</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">as nuclear powers such as information</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.220" end="00:31:09.280" style="s2">technology where there is a dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:12.790" style="s2">difference in terms of the cost of raw</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.280" end="00:31:15.280" style="s2">materials and so you know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.790" end="00:31:17.650" style="s2">new paradigm when you have that kick off</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.280" end="00:31:20.380" style="s2">of that beginning and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.650" end="00:31:22.570" style="s2">cycle of other industrial behaviors that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.380" end="00:31:25.180" style="s2">happen after that in a sequence and in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.570" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">order so once you get that kick off of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.180" end="00:31:31.870" style="s2">this new technology like we did in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:35.050" style="s2">digital age then you have a rush to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.870" end="00:31:37.240" style="s2">discover the complex goods that you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.050" end="00:31:39.820" style="s2">use to deliver it you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.240" end="00:31:41.620" style="s2">discover the microprocessor and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.820" end="00:31:43.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a rush to discover the personal</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.620" end="00:31:46.450" style="s2">computer which is the good that carries</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:48.820" style="s2">that innovation forward then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.450" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">infrastructural development with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.820" end="00:31:51.700" style="s2">know the internet and so forth and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.440" end="00:31:53.430" style="s2">then there&#39;s the service side</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.700" end="00:31:56.230" style="s2">development where people start hanging</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.430" end="00:31:58.450" style="s2">various different lifestyle changes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.230" end="00:32:01.420" style="s2">service changes and so forth onto that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.450" end="00:32:03.340" style="s2">internet you know and so if you go back</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.420" end="00:32:06.520" style="s2">we have a similar sequence through all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.340" end="00:32:08.200" style="s2">these these paradigms and because that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.520" end="00:32:11.230" style="s2">sequence is so powerful and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.200" end="00:32:14.830" style="s2">predictable we can look forward into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.230" end="00:32:17.530" style="s2">next 50 years and say well we&#39;re do for</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.830" end="00:32:19.300" style="s2">us a paradigm change we already have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.530" end="00:32:21.790" style="s2">pretty good idea what those technologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.300" end="00:32:25.180" style="s2">are and we&#39;re starting to see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.790" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">sequence unfold and so we can say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.180" end="00:32:30.280" style="s2">right now we&#39;re in the period or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:34.510" style="s2">hunting for that that thermodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.280" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">change right and the leading candidate</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.510" end="00:32:37.690" style="s2">for driving us over that hump it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:40.540" style="s2">actually a two hump</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.690" end="00:32:43.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve got quantum computing and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.540" end="00:32:46.270" style="s2">you&#39;ve got clean energy that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:48.970" style="s2">undercut natural gas as being the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.270" end="00:32:51.550" style="s2">most effect cost-effective and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.970" end="00:32:54.870" style="s2">can get to that point where we have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.550" end="00:32:57.610" style="s2">energy as well as the information</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.870" end="00:33:00.580" style="s2">innovations that drive us into a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.610" end="00:33:01.190" style="s2">level of productivity then we will be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.580" end="00:33:03.320" style="s2">the sixth</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.190" end="00:33:05.720" style="s2">and then we can start talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.320" end="00:33:07.369" style="s2">products and the infrastructures and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.720" end="00:33:08.929" style="s2">then eventually the services that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.369" end="00:33:11.869" style="s2">going to all hang off of that in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.929" end="00:33:14.509" style="s2">sequence now why would you point at</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.869" end="00:33:17.210" style="s2">quantum computing I mean it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.509" end="00:33:19.340" style="s2">that it could open up a very vast domain</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.210" end="00:33:21.499" style="s2">but so far it looks like its</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.340" end="00:33:24.440" style="s2">applications might be relatively limited</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.499" end="00:33:26.479" style="s2">to you know certain classes of arcane</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.440" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">and difficult problems wouldn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.479" end="00:33:29.869" style="s2">possibility and actually they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:31.729" style="s2">rapid the current advancement up the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.869" end="00:33:34.700" style="s2">early parts of the slope of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.729" end="00:33:36.710" style="s2">intelligence be a potentially stronger</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.700" end="00:33:39.769" style="s2">argument for the basis of the six</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.710" end="00:33:41.539" style="s2">paradigm at least not the IT side well</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.769" end="00:33:44.749" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a very profound question</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.539" end="00:33:47.570" style="s2">because you would say how much of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.749" end="00:33:50.299" style="s2">artificial intelligence is simply an</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.570" end="00:33:53.479" style="s2">extension of the digital paradigm right</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.299" end="00:33:56.659" style="s2">or how much of it is going to be firmly</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.479" end="00:33:59.359" style="s2">rooted in the new paradigm and let me</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.659" end="00:34:02.119" style="s2">just briefly interject to label the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.359" end="00:34:04.580" style="s2">paradigm so the new paradigm that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.119" end="00:34:06.769" style="s2">speculating it could be labeled multiple</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.580" end="00:34:09.079" style="s2">things and there&#39;s a debate about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.769" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">Carlota Perez wants to call it the green</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.079" end="00:34:14.750" style="s2">paradigm because she wants to focus all</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:17.169" style="s2">attention on green growth and how the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.750" end="00:34:20.329" style="s2">new energy is going to produce that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.169" end="00:34:22.279" style="s2">however there&#39;s a counter argument to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.329" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">say it should be labeled the organic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.279" end="00:34:30.379" style="s2">paradigm and the reason why is because</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">we&#39;re reaching a state where we have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.379" end="00:34:35.869" style="s2">level of technology necessary to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:38.750" style="s2">into complex systems in a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.869" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">way than we ever did before very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.750" end="00:34:44.059" style="s2">how Kevin Kelley of Wired magazine</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:48.559" style="s2">always used to kind of forecast this</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.059" end="00:34:51.889" style="s2">inevitable march towards these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.559" end="00:34:55.460" style="s2">more organic like systems in society</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.889" end="00:34:56.569" style="s2">right the argument is that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.460" end="00:34:58.369" style="s2">were talking about these things for</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.569" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">decades and that&#39;s always the case the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.369" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">question is when is it the new norm</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:05.299" style="s2">right and so the argument is that over</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:09.020" style="s2">the next 50 years we&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.299" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">organic perspective and the organic</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.020" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">sectors the technologies that work with</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">organic type technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:21.109" style="s2">overtake the digital in terms of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:23.660" style="s2">the new norm of our mind frame the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.109" end="00:35:26.630" style="s2">we approach science the way we approach</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.660" end="00:35:28.430" style="s2">technology broadly and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.630" end="00:35:30.529" style="s2">during the digital paradigm were annoyed</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.430" end="00:35:32.329" style="s2">let&#39;s say people who worked in Prior</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.529" end="00:35:34.369" style="s2">industries like say you were a chemist</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.329" end="00:35:36.619" style="s2">or something they were like well I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.369" end="00:35:38.569" style="s2">chemist is that not technology how come</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.619" end="00:35:41.270" style="s2">the word tech is synonymous with digital</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.569" end="00:35:42.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not fair it&#39;s not even true so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.270" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">know people like that who are always</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.710" end="00:35:46.190" style="s2">kind of annoyed with that and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:48.710" style="s2">counter-argument is no no we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.190" end="00:35:51.589" style="s2">digital paradigm which means that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.710" end="00:35:53.750" style="s2">high tech industries and the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.589" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">being led by a lot of these these these</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.750" end="00:35:58.339" style="s2">technologies the others don&#39;t disappear</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:36:00.529" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they just like chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.339" end="00:36:03.579" style="s2">just vanishes it just says that during</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.529" end="00:36:07.789" style="s2">that time period the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.579" end="00:36:10.010" style="s2">cognitive shape of science is around</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.789" end="00:36:12.849" style="s2">digital thinking and what we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.010" end="00:36:15.730" style="s2">at is a sea change right now to shape</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.849" end="00:36:18.619" style="s2">cognitive perspectives around science</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.730" end="00:36:21.140" style="s2">from the organic perspective more than</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.619" end="00:36:22.849" style="s2">the digital when you tell your organic</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.140" end="00:36:24.440" style="s2">does that mean living or the way you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.849" end="00:36:27.140" style="s2">were using it sound like it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.440" end="00:36:30.950" style="s2">synonym for you know complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.140" end="00:36:34.130" style="s2">thinking well let&#39;s just say that in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.950" end="00:36:36.829" style="s2">same sense that evolutionary theory came</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.130" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">out of a certain set of Sciences well</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.829" end="00:36:41.809" style="s2">the a lot of what we&#39;re looking at over</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">the next 50 years is informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.809" end="00:36:45.859" style="s2">kind of thinking that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:48.680" style="s2">organic technologies and organic</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.859" end="00:36:50.690" style="s2">perspectives and a lot of the technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.680" end="00:36:55.039" style="s2">will directly be in those fields it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.690" end="00:36:59.869" style="s2">be in medicine it&#39;ll be in so it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.039" end="00:37:02.180" style="s2">in biotech things of that nature so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.869" end="00:37:04.130" style="s2">center of attention is shifting and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.180" end="00:37:06.890" style="s2">you were go to MIT right now or to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.130" end="00:37:09.170" style="s2">Stanford University right now people</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.890" end="00:37:12.440" style="s2">like Noam Chomsky are making the claim</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.170" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to see more organic</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.440" end="00:37:17.270" style="s2">type technology startups right now than</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:20.319" style="s2">digital in those places</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.270" end="00:37:23.059" style="s2">I heard him describing that recently</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.319" end="00:37:25.309" style="s2">probably true at MIT I mean MIT has a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.059" end="00:37:27.619" style="s2">tremendous set of spin-offs and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.309" end="00:37:28.280" style="s2">especially bio engineering that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.619" end="00:37:30.020" style="s2">their very</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.280" end="00:37:31.490" style="s2">Asteria spin-offs right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.020" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">kind of at the intersection of the two</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.490" end="00:37:35.210" style="s2">and so if this paradigm shift is correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">you&#39;d expect to see hybrids like</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.210" end="00:37:40.130" style="s2">bioengineering that&#39;s right and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:42.730" style="s2">happens is during the paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.130" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a process that I call a well I</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.730" end="00:37:46.670" style="s2">stole it from Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.930" end="00:37:49.670" style="s2">basically the integral Philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.670" end="00:37:52.310" style="s2">transcend and include so when you enter</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.670" end="00:37:54.050" style="s2">the organic paradigm you don&#39;t simply</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.310" end="00:37:56.630" style="s2">kick the ladder out from underneath you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.050" end="00:37:58.910" style="s2">you include those things that brought</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.630" end="00:38:00.680" style="s2">you there so the very first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.910" end="00:38:04.460" style="s2">you&#39;re going to see is digital and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.680" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">organic hybridization as the center of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.460" end="00:38:09.800" style="s2">action and an example of that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:13.070" style="s2">bioinformatics right and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.800" end="00:38:14.660" style="s2">this huge bioinformatics focus and what</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.070" end="00:38:16.190" style="s2">you were talking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.660" end="00:38:19.250" style="s2">artificial intelligence this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.190" end="00:38:21.830" style="s2">wanted to come full circle if your</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.250" end="00:38:26.690" style="s2">branch of artificial intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.830" end="00:38:29.810" style="s2">based on the classic design principles</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.690" end="00:38:32.450" style="s2">the classic digital design principles</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.810" end="00:38:35.030" style="s2">then you&#39;re still in that paradigm if</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.450" end="00:38:38.450" style="s2">your artificial intelligence is using</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.030" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">new design principles that are more</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.450" end="00:38:44.870" style="s2">characteristic of organic type thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:47.420" style="s2">then your your RAI is now in the new</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.870" end="00:38:51.610" style="s2">paradigm and so let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.420" end="00:38:55.030" style="s2">example so classic digital paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.610" end="00:39:00.770" style="s2">design principles include such logics as</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.030" end="00:39:04.100" style="s2">modularity okay so for a long time good</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.770" end="00:39:05.420" style="s2">digital design was modular you know you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.100" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">would basically make something</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.420" end="00:39:10.250" style="s2">hierarchically decomposable you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:11.960" style="s2">make it so that each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.250" end="00:39:13.880" style="s2">modules could be easily broken off</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.960" end="00:39:18.170" style="s2">separately and then rolled back together</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.880" end="00:39:20.300" style="s2">right now that&#39;s one of those design</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.170" end="00:39:22.730" style="s2">principles that&#39;s changing and if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.300" end="00:39:25.120" style="s2">look at newer artificial intelligence it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:28.220" style="s2">has more of an organic perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.120" end="00:39:32.630" style="s2">interdependence where you wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.220" end="00:39:34.850" style="s2">able to so easily decompose and these</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.630" end="00:39:36.410" style="s2">various pieces of the software and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.850" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">roll them back up together and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.410" end="00:39:42.490" style="s2">the argument is that by admitting</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:45.070" style="s2">inherent complexity into your software</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.490" end="00:39:48.340" style="s2">design you&#39;re going to lose the ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.070" end="00:39:50.680" style="s2">to control it like you used to in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.340" end="00:39:55.030" style="s2">digital paradigm it was much easier for</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.680" end="00:39:58.120" style="s2">the engineer to control the AI by making</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.030" end="00:39:59.950" style="s2">it modular and and so like if you look</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.120" end="00:40:01.780" style="s2">at some of the pioneers of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.950" end="00:40:04.360" style="s2">intelligence like Herbert Simon and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.780" end="00:40:07.060" style="s2">Newell and so forth they express this</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.360" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">all very clearly Herbert Simon one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.060" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">the founders of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:15.070" style="s2">described system deep composability</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:17.740" style="s2">as an inherently important design</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.070" end="00:40:19.870" style="s2">principle and he said you can have fully</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.740" end="00:40:22.900" style="s2">decomposable systems which become</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.870" end="00:40:25.030" style="s2">modular you can have partially</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.900" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">decomposable systems or nearly be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.030" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">composable which have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:32.080" style="s2">interdependence and then you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">non decomposable systems which are so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.080" end="00:40:36.820" style="s2">radically under interdependent that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:40.350" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t split the market part at</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.820" end="00:40:43.300" style="s2">all and with what Simon said was that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.350" end="00:40:45.610" style="s2">human systems were nearly decomposable</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.300" end="00:40:47.950" style="s2">in other words the ordinary business or</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.610" end="00:40:50.350" style="s2">the orbit or the human organization and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.950" end="00:40:53.230" style="s2">that means that it had some decomposed</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:55.950" style="s2">ability but it also had feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.230" end="00:40:59.890" style="s2">and systems within it which made it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.950" end="00:41:01.480" style="s2">difficult to fully ever control there</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.890" end="00:41:03.660" style="s2">are certain aspects that can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.480" end="00:41:07.180" style="s2">controlled in certain that cannot and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.660" end="00:41:09.070" style="s2">the argument was that those informal</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.180" end="00:41:12.490" style="s2">aspects of the organization should be</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.070" end="00:41:15.610" style="s2">allowed to evolve on their own without</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.490" end="00:41:18.670" style="s2">full hierarchical decomposition by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.610" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">designer of the organization and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.670" end="00:41:23.050" style="s2">argument is that when you go into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:26.110" style="s2">organic paradigm what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.050" end="00:41:27.430" style="s2">you&#39;re saying our technology is now</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.110" end="00:41:30.790" style="s2">going to be operating in that near</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.430" end="00:41:32.740" style="s2">decomposable framework we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.790" end="00:41:35.560" style="s2">create artificial intelligence that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.740" end="00:41:37.960" style="s2">can&#39;t fully control we can only</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.560" end="00:41:40.510" style="s2">partially control it and we need to give</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.960" end="00:41:43.960" style="s2">it some of the freedom to informally do</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.510" end="00:41:47.130" style="s2">what it needs to do and then have some</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.960" end="00:41:50.020" style="s2">faith that basically the results are</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.130" end="00:41:50.590" style="s2">clear and coherent and that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.020" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.590" end="00:41:55.240" style="s2">if that makes any sense yep absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:58.600" style="s2">if you think about the you know machine</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.240" end="00:42:01.270" style="s2">learning neural net revolution it has</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.600" end="00:42:04.360" style="s2">aspects of both right the neural nets</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:06.280" style="s2">themselves are really pretty damn opaque</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.360" end="00:42:07.990" style="s2">to human understanding though that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.280" end="00:42:09.790" style="s2">getting a little better at it on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.990" end="00:42:11.560" style="s2">other hand we are building you know how</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.790" end="00:42:14.290" style="s2">many layers should this have you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.560" end="00:42:16.900" style="s2">what kinds of layers etc so there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.290" end="00:42:19.410" style="s2">some kind of still some modular thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.900" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">but the actual details of implementation</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:24.970" style="s2">are very much as if they were evolved</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:27.010" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not clean and level</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.970" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">separated etc so I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.010" end="00:42:31.750" style="s2">something to that there&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:35.110" style="s2">branches of AI that are explicitly aimed</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.750" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">at using the human mind as a model right</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.110" end="00:42:41.110" style="s2">that&#39;s right exactly and it&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:44.380" style="s2">talking about is in the sixth paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.110" end="00:42:48.070" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a shift to using</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.380" end="00:42:50.500" style="s2">organic systems as the model for high</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.070" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">tech and so that means that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.500" end="00:42:55.840" style="s2">be modeling things after the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">which I called neural morphism basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.840" end="00:43:02.530" style="s2">a big part of the sixth paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">we&#39;re entering is new neural morphism</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.530" end="00:43:07.420" style="s2">everything it&#39;s one of those general</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:09.310" style="s2">design principles that everything works</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.420" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">like a brain if you want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.310" end="00:43:14.860" style="s2">smart infrastructure right you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:17.500" style="s2">going to do it like a railroad back in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.860" end="00:43:19.900" style="s2">the second paradigm because those were</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.500" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">different design principles you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.900" end="00:43:23.590" style="s2">to do it in the six paradigm all of your</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:25.660" style="s2">infrastructures that you&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.590" end="00:43:28.180" style="s2">to roll out your technologies will</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.660" end="00:43:29.970" style="s2">themselves be smart and that means</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.180" end="00:43:32.890" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have network</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.970" end="00:43:34.420" style="s2">infrastructures that are smart to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.890" end="00:43:36.460" style="s2">certain extent and we don&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.420" end="00:43:39.640" style="s2">control them and they work more in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.460" end="00:43:41.830" style="s2">brain like or neuromorphic pattern yep</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.640" end="00:43:43.150" style="s2">makes perfect sense and of course a near</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.830" end="00:43:44.650" style="s2">neighbor of that and again we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.150" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">about an organic age and this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.650" end="00:43:48.370" style="s2">something that seems to fit that very</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:51.430" style="s2">well is with our growing understanding</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.370" end="00:43:53.650" style="s2">of genetics and genetic based</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.430" end="00:43:56.260" style="s2">development and our ability to intervene</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.650" end="00:43:59.050" style="s2">with technologies like CRISPR you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.260" end="00:44:01.300" style="s2">we have the ability to steer biological</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.050" end="00:44:03.220" style="s2">evolution in other species and even</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.300" end="00:44:04.330" style="s2">ourselves if we&#39;re so inclined could</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.220" end="00:44:07.750" style="s2">that be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.330" end="00:44:09.730" style="s2">Organic paradigm absolutely and what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.750" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">just presented was the segue into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.730" end="00:44:14.110" style="s2">cultural dimension of industrial</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:17.650" style="s2">revolutions because if I were going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.110" end="00:44:19.690" style="s2">describe the the paradigm in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.650" end="00:44:22.920" style="s2">cultural dimensions I would call it the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.690" end="00:44:25.720" style="s2">transhuman paradigm because although</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.920" end="00:44:28.180" style="s2">Humanity has been on a march towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.720" end="00:44:30.220" style="s2">trans human behaviors throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.180" end="00:44:31.870" style="s2">entire history we&#39;re getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.220" end="00:44:35.650" style="s2">point where it&#39;s being moved to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.870" end="00:44:38.050" style="s2">forefront and Kovic 19 is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.650" end="00:44:42.130" style="s2">events that helps us to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.050" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">much trans human thinking is being moved</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.130" end="00:44:47.080" style="s2">into the normal consciousness right</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:49.570" style="s2">where we&#39;re starting to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.080" end="00:44:51.960" style="s2">like do we really want to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.570" end="00:44:56.860" style="s2">world where the entire human race is</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.960" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">dependent on a vaccine that basically so</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.860" end="00:45:00.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the Bill Gates kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:04.540" style="s2">perspective where we may be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.490" end="00:45:06.340" style="s2">technologies that are universal and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.540" end="00:45:09.190" style="s2">that means is that you don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.340" end="00:45:11.620" style="s2">outside of the system and so everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.190" end="00:45:13.150" style="s2">has to buy into the man-made or</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.620" end="00:45:16.900" style="s2">human-made excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.150" end="00:45:18.640" style="s2">the human-made technologies and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.900" end="00:45:22.660" style="s2">many of the people leading this or women</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:25.450" style="s2">and and LGBTQ folks it really is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.660" end="00:45:28.150" style="s2">phenomenal how many people in that once</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.450" end="00:45:30.760" style="s2">oppressed community are at the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.150" end="00:45:32.850" style="s2">of this right but basically what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.760" end="00:45:38.050" style="s2">doing is they&#39;re they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.850" end="00:45:40.390" style="s2">breaking down all of the natural the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.050" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">boundaries between humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.390" end="00:45:46.420" style="s2">technology and also between humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:49.990" style="s2">nature are all changing and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.420" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">looking at is a world where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.990" end="00:45:55.060" style="s2">to ask ourselves how much do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:59.410" style="s2">buy into this altered altered reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.060" end="00:46:01.750" style="s2">and for our own good or not and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.410" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">thing is that women bought in earlier</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.750" end="00:46:07.390" style="s2">than men did if you look at the birth</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.630" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">control pill that was one of those</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.390" end="00:46:11.710" style="s2">things where it says you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">better living through technology and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.710" end="00:46:16.020" style="s2">directly interacts with your your very</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:18.060" style="s2">being right</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.020" end="00:46:20.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s also something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.060" end="00:46:22.260" style="s2">willfully choose to participate in do</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.670" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">you want to take hormonal therapies</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.260" end="00:46:28.230" style="s2">right so there I&#39;m not saying that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:29.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t already do that we did but what</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.230" end="00:46:33.810" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about it is that becoming</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.730" end="00:46:36.540" style="s2">the new normal throughout Society as to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.810" end="00:46:38.790" style="s2">whether or not how far we go interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.540" end="00:46:40.020" style="s2">now this brings me to my next point one</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.790" end="00:46:42.030" style="s2">of the things that was really an</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.020" end="00:46:45.480" style="s2">eye-opener for me in reading the Neo</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.030" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">Schumpeterian material was how central</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.480" end="00:46:51.510" style="s2">the concept of lifestyle is to what</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:54.690" style="s2">brings on the next epoch and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.510" end="00:46:57.150" style="s2">gives it fuel absolutely lifestyle is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.690" end="00:47:00.150" style="s2">very much front and center in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.150" end="00:47:02.550" style="s2">present view of the economy and in mine</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.150" end="00:47:03.930" style="s2">as well let me give me a little quote</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.550" end="00:47:06.270" style="s2">here and I could give you a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.930" end="00:47:08.010" style="s2">to rip off lifestyle is a shaped demand</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.270" end="00:47:10.380" style="s2">for new products and services and those</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.010" end="00:47:12.840" style="s2">products and services then become the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.380" end="00:47:15.300" style="s2">major source of new jobs and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.840" end="00:47:18.290" style="s2">essentially at the entry point into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.300" end="00:47:21.030" style="s2">golden age so go run with that would you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.290" end="00:47:22.380" style="s2">absolutely so one of the ways I like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.030" end="00:47:25.170" style="s2">describe this is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.380" end="00:47:28.170" style="s2">two-sided process going on in industrial</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.170" end="00:47:30.690" style="s2">revolutions you have the hard tech side</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.170" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">of things and the hard tech side of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.690" end="00:47:35.670" style="s2">things is what you know if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:38.760" style="s2">Marxist you would call that the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.670" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">the infrastructure or the base depending</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.760" end="00:47:43.500" style="s2">on the classic Marxist theory the hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:45.570" style="s2">tech side of things it is based on cost</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.500" end="00:47:47.700" style="s2">and thermodynamics and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.570" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">physicists can even get into the game of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.700" end="00:47:53.100" style="s2">describing how economically efficient</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:56.840" style="s2">the economy is in terms of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.100" end="00:47:59.430" style="s2">but when you get onto the soft side of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.840" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">society you realize that a very large</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.430" end="00:48:05.010" style="s2">percentage of the economy is socially</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:07.020" style="s2">constructed and I&#39;m not talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.010" end="00:48:10.710" style="s2">radical social construction where</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.020" end="00:48:12.620" style="s2">there&#39;s no truthiness or no reality to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.710" end="00:48:15.780" style="s2">it or something I&#39;m talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.620" end="00:48:17.820" style="s2">modest form of social construction where</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.780" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">we realize that it&#39;s politically and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.820" end="00:48:22.830" style="s2">it&#39;s contingent on people&#39;s beliefs you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.650" style="s2">know so we all have to buy into</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.830" end="00:48:27.930" style="s2">something for it to be true and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.650" end="00:48:30.750" style="s2">is that a very large percentage of ikana</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.930" end="00:48:33.960" style="s2">is on that side currently we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.750" end="00:48:37.160" style="s2">about at least 40% of the economy as</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.960" end="00:48:39.180" style="s2">being what I would call cultural Goods</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.160" end="00:48:40.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually maybe more than that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.180" end="00:48:42.510" style="s2">because you know as you know we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.890" end="00:48:45.329" style="s2">little bit about game B from time to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.510" end="00:48:48.660" style="s2">time here one of my strong views of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.329" end="00:48:50.490" style="s2">game a a tractor is that an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.660" end="00:48:52.589" style="s2">what&#39;s we can think of as our material</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.490" end="00:48:54.750" style="s2">economy is also basically culturally</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.589" end="00:48:56.849" style="s2">driven in that one of the binding</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.750" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">energies of the current status quo I</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.849" end="00:49:00.779" style="s2">would describe as status through</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.770" end="00:49:03.690" style="s2">materialism which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.779" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">hypertrophic lis gone nuts over the last</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.690" end="00:49:08.700" style="s2">40 or 50 years so the culturally</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:13.829" style="s2">determined part may be even bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.700" end="00:49:15.059" style="s2">40% right right so basically um when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.829" end="00:49:18.150" style="s2">make that number</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.059" end="00:49:20.430" style="s2">unforeseen partial effects out so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.150" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is that you have complex</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.430" end="00:49:24.210" style="s2">goods that have both the material</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.369" style="s2">component and a cultural component and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.210" end="00:49:29.809" style="s2">then you would say well how much of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.369" end="00:49:33.210" style="s2">economy could you parse out as being</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.809" end="00:49:36.089" style="s2">socially constructed with with high</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.210" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">confidence as a versus how much of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.089" end="00:49:41.369" style="s2">could you reduce to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:43.950" style="s2">efficiency equation and so you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.369" end="00:49:45.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a range of debate about that but</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.950" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">for right now I&#39;m making the argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.660" end="00:49:52.140" style="s2">that you can parse out about 40% give or</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:54.809" style="s2">take and say we know that this amount of</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.140" end="00:49:58.349" style="s2">it is culturally conditions in a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.809" end="00:50:00.450" style="s2">strong sense and that means that most of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.349" end="00:50:02.789" style="s2">the demand is based around how it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.450" end="00:50:05.130" style="s2">updates people&#39;s beliefs the experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.789" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">economy the attention economy those</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.130" end="00:50:08.940" style="s2">things are very much in the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:11.069" style="s2">goods dimension because what they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:12.569" style="s2">to do is you know you have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.069" end="00:50:14.789" style="s2">budget for how much you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.569" end="00:50:18.210" style="s2">spend on cultural goods and then the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.789" end="00:50:22.230" style="s2">attention economy divides that up into</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.210" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">you know basically what you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.230" end="00:50:25.740" style="s2">to pay attention to and how important</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">you think those things are to your life</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.740" end="00:50:32.099" style="s2">and so anyway the argument here is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">as time moves forward the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.099" end="00:50:37.859" style="s2">component grows so even though we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:39.299" style="s2">having a growing economy in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.859" end="00:50:41.069" style="s2">material side</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.299" end="00:50:43.499" style="s2">we&#39;re consuming more natural resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.069" end="00:50:45.779" style="s2">and so forth the thing is that we may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.499" end="00:50:48.959" style="s2">hitting a phase where we can stop</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.779" end="00:50:52.169" style="s2">growing on the material side we call it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.959" end="00:50:53.640" style="s2">dematerialization right and so people</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.169" end="00:50:55.229" style="s2">like Carlota Perez are making the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.640" end="00:50:58.949" style="s2">argument that we&#39;ve kind of hit a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.229" end="00:51:02.249" style="s2">materialization limit per person per</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.949" end="00:51:04.199" style="s2">human you know so your your individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.249" end="00:51:05.519" style="s2">material footprint so it&#39;s not even just</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.199" end="00:51:08.909" style="s2">in terms of carbon but your overall</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.519" end="00:51:10.709" style="s2">material consumption and the argument is</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.909" end="00:51:13.409" style="s2">that the cultural dimension is going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.709" end="00:51:15.749" style="s2">continue to grow but over the next 50</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.409" end="00:51:17.759" style="s2">years a lot of the technical innovations</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.749" end="00:51:19.739" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to be doing are going</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.759" end="00:51:21.809" style="s2">to be dematerializing on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.739" end="00:51:23.669" style="s2">and that means we&#39;re gonna have a even</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.809" end="00:51:25.859" style="s2">bigger swing towards the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.669" end="00:51:27.630" style="s2">dimension than ever before so we had a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.859" end="00:51:30.479" style="s2">really big swing that direction in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.630" end="00:51:32.549" style="s2">1970s with the virtualization you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.479" end="00:51:35.699" style="s2">through digital means and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.549" end="00:51:37.859" style="s2">the argument is that we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.699" end="00:51:40.799" style="s2">another swing that takes us even further</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.859" end="00:51:42.929" style="s2">down that route no doubt about it when I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.799" end="00:51:45.899" style="s2">hear my people say that they&#39;re anti</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.929" end="00:51:48.599" style="s2">growth I basically assume that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.899" end="00:51:51.329" style="s2">don&#39;t understand this right in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.599" end="00:51:53.130" style="s2">call it growth into the microcosm just</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.329" end="00:51:55.799" style="s2">as an example I have my iPhone in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.130" end="00:51:57.329" style="s2">hand cost about thousand dollars when it</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.799" end="00:51:59.219" style="s2">was new I believe three or four years</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.329" end="00:52:00.449" style="s2">ago and I bought it and you compare that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.219" end="00:52:02.279" style="s2">to what else could you get for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.449" end="00:52:04.049" style="s2">thousand dollars I ran the numbers on</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.279" end="00:52:08.099" style="s2">the current price of corn you could buy</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.049" end="00:52:10.979" style="s2">30 bushels of corn the bushels 57 pound</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.099" end="00:52:13.169" style="s2">so 1500 pounds of corn right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.979" end="00:52:16.799" style="s2">imagine that out your window you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.169" end="00:52:20.399" style="s2">how much energy fertilizer land etc went</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.799" end="00:52:22.769" style="s2">into producing 1500 pounds of kernels of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.399" end="00:52:25.079" style="s2">corn versus this little thing made out</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.769" end="00:52:27.149" style="s2">of glass and a little bit of copper a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.079" end="00:52:28.859" style="s2">little bit of silicon right and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.149" end="00:52:30.709" style="s2">value the to about the same so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.859" end="00:52:33.449" style="s2">you know a fine example of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.709" end="00:52:35.009" style="s2">dematerialization or imagine don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.449" end="00:52:37.049" style="s2">this is on the horizon soon but if we</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.009" end="00:52:39.959" style="s2">think about this organic you know AI</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.049" end="00:52:42.449" style="s2">meets gene twiddling suppose you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.959" end="00:52:44.609" style="s2">get an injection which would add 40 IQ</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.449" end="00:52:46.409" style="s2">points right through quitting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.609" end="00:52:47.579" style="s2">chemistry in your neurons or something</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.409" end="00:52:49.469" style="s2">and think what would you pay for that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.579" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">the answer is a shitload and what would</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.469" end="00:52:52.440" style="s2">it actually consist of you know a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">of milliliters</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.440" end="00:52:56.730" style="s2">liquid at most probably so there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:59.010" style="s2">know a huge amount of value that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.730" end="00:53:00.210" style="s2">very substantially deep materialized and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.010" end="00:53:03.060" style="s2">I think when people say that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.210" end="00:53:05.190" style="s2">anti growth they have to really reframe</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.060" end="00:53:11.700" style="s2">that in the language you used which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.190" end="00:53:14.010" style="s2">you have to dematerialization a point</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.700" end="00:53:16.740" style="s2">that not only are we at the limits of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.010" end="00:53:18.780" style="s2">the material intensity of our existence</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.740" end="00:53:21.090" style="s2">but truthfully we&#39;re probably well over</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.780" end="00:53:23.790" style="s2">it and we might be over it by a factor</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.090" end="00:53:24.840" style="s2">of two or three right and so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.790" end="00:53:26.340" style="s2">going to survive on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.840" end="00:53:28.710" style="s2">particularly if we think we can survive</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.340" end="00:53:31.380" style="s2">with 10 billion people 10 or 11 which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.710" end="00:53:33.540" style="s2">the current United Nations forecasts for</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.380" end="00:53:36.480" style="s2">the end of this century we may have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.540" end="00:53:39.150" style="s2">actually not just be static in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.480" end="00:53:41.070" style="s2">materialization of our existence but we</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.150" end="00:53:42.630" style="s2">have to you know radically reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.070" end="00:53:45.170" style="s2">material footprint of our existence</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.630" end="00:53:47.850" style="s2">perhaps by a factor of two as a start</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.170" end="00:53:49.710" style="s2">yeah let me close the loop with one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.850" end="00:53:52.170" style="s2">the things that you just said talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.710" end="00:53:57.090" style="s2">about relating the material world to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.170" end="00:53:58.980" style="s2">cultural world so basically there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.090" end="00:54:02.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship there you</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.980" end="00:54:05.790" style="s2">mentioned how much would people want a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.760" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">therapy that made them smarter all right</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.790" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">that is a transhuman innovation okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:14.010" style="s2">in the trans human world we usually talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:16.110" style="s2">about there being so there&#39;s trans</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.010" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">therapies right there&#39;s like so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.110" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">got some sort of deficiency or problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:23.850" style="s2">and you can go right now to a hospital</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:26.310" style="s2">we&#39;ll have an artificial limb made for</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.850" end="00:54:29.670" style="s2">you or something of that nature but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.310" end="00:54:31.740" style="s2">once you get past that level of social</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.670" end="00:54:34.290" style="s2">acceptance of Technology you ask well</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.740" end="00:54:36.090" style="s2">can we enhance ourselves and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.290" end="00:54:39.030" style="s2">through that analysis and you say well</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.090" end="00:54:41.130" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to have this big social</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.030" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">push where people are saying please give</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.130" end="00:54:46.980" style="s2">me the technical power to enhance myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:48.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the key signs that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.980" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">you&#39;re entering into a trans human era</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.870" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">is that you have things like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:54.570" style="s2">transhumanist Olympics okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:57.060" style="s2">real thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.570" end="00:54:59.310" style="s2">by the way there&#39;s a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.060" end="00:55:01.590" style="s2">organizations that have started trans</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.310" end="00:55:03.960" style="s2">human Olympics and what they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.590" end="00:55:05.849" style="s2">to do is normalize the enhancement of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.960" end="00:55:08.249" style="s2">the human to compete</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.849" end="00:55:11.609" style="s2">Olympic tests that wouldn&#39;t be possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.249" end="00:55:13.079" style="s2">prior to enhances I love that I used to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.609" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">have an idea called the unlimited class</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.079" end="00:55:17.339" style="s2">Olympics where you could imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:20.449" style="s2">sprinters being hooked up the blood</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.339" end="00:55:23.130" style="s2">oxidization machines in the blocks right</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.449" end="00:55:24.690" style="s2">yes you&#39;d spent a bunch of money to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.130" end="00:55:27.269" style="s2">sure that as you took off the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.690" end="00:55:29.309" style="s2">smoothly slid out and your blood oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.269" end="00:55:31.019" style="s2">levels were pumped to ridiculously high</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.309" end="00:55:33.589" style="s2">levels let&#39;s see how fast we could make</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.019" end="00:55:36.329" style="s2">humans actually go goddamn it right</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.589" end="00:55:38.969" style="s2">exactly and guess what that is now</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.329" end="00:55:42.599" style="s2">socially acceptable where that wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.969" end="00:55:45.180" style="s2">Prior eras and a large part of that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.599" end="00:55:46.890" style="s2">you look at the comic book sector oh man</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.180" end="00:55:49.559" style="s2">this is such I could do a whole podcast</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.890" end="00:55:51.809" style="s2">just on this one Jim but basically if</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.559" end="00:55:55.170" style="s2">you look at the rise of the mutants</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.809" end="00:55:58.559" style="s2">right that after we&#39;ve thrown off our</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.170" end="00:56:00.719" style="s2">burgeois culture and our bourgeois gods</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.559" end="00:56:03.660" style="s2">and so forth right from the Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.719" end="00:56:06.900" style="s2">perspective we went through that</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.660" end="00:56:09.059" style="s2">well now what okay so the next logical</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.900" end="00:56:12.150" style="s2">progression from Nietzsche and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.059" end="00:56:15.690" style="s2">was the ubermensch rate the superhuman</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.150" end="00:56:18.180" style="s2">the transcendent that transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.690" end="00:56:20.459" style="s2">natural species the Arg and there being</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.180" end="00:56:22.199" style="s2">that the natural species was not the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.459" end="00:56:24.930" style="s2">best that we can be the best that we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.199" end="00:56:27.630" style="s2">be is our own innovation being put back</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.930" end="00:56:31.019" style="s2">into ourselves to better ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.630" end="00:56:32.969" style="s2">in the digital paradigm what you saw was</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.019" end="00:56:34.829" style="s2">this well the normalization that</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.969" end="00:56:37.589" style="s2">happened back in the third Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.829" end="00:56:39.569" style="s2">Revolution but basically in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.589" end="00:56:41.789" style="s2">paradigm it was extended further with</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.569" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">this whole you know cultural Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.789" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">in the 1960s and 70s and there was this</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:48.420" style="s2">big fragmentation and on the left you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">had a bunch of people saying well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.420" end="00:56:52.739" style="s2">the new religion for us basically or</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:56.699" style="s2">what&#39;s the substitute for religion right</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.739" end="00:56:59.249" style="s2">and a lot of people got into the occult</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.699" end="00:57:03.170" style="s2">and they are got into psychedelics got</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.249" end="00:57:06.449" style="s2">into powers of the mind and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.170" end="00:57:08.489" style="s2">that helped clear the path for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.449" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">discussion of well not only are we going</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.489" end="00:57:11.609" style="s2">to enhance our body physically like like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:14.009" style="s2">Superman or something</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.609" end="00:57:16.170" style="s2">but we&#39;re also going to work with magic</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.009" end="00:57:19.289" style="s2">powers and psychedelic powers we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.170" end="00:57:19.660" style="s2">going to try to explore can we recreate</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.289" end="00:57:21.789" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.660" end="00:57:25.780" style="s2">powers of these mutants can we all</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.789" end="00:57:28.869" style="s2">become x-men you know and we have the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.780" end="00:57:31.510" style="s2">first generation in world history where</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.869" end="00:57:33.099" style="s2">I would argue that a majority of youth</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.510" end="00:57:36.670" style="s2">are all saying sign me up</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.099" end="00:57:39.579" style="s2">I want magic powers and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.670" end="00:57:45.010" style="s2">reflected in our mass media because if</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.579" end="00:57:47.470" style="s2">you look at the Hollywood films seven</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.010" end="00:57:51.819" style="s2">out of ten blockbusters in a given year</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.470" end="00:57:54.940" style="s2">now are superheroes seven out of ten</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.819" end="00:57:59.109" style="s2">that means that we have a mass consensus</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.940" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">that we all want our new gods to be us</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.109" end="00:58:06.490" style="s2">and that we want God&#39;s to be made in our</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:10.030" style="s2">own image these are very ordinary type</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.490" end="00:58:11.260" style="s2">of people in their origins in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.030" end="00:58:13.210" style="s2">except for they just happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.260" end="00:58:14.890" style="s2">superpowers and then they have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.210" end="00:58:17.140" style="s2">discover whether or not they&#39;re here or</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.890" end="00:58:19.660" style="s2">villain and oh you have Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.140" end="00:58:21.309" style="s2">right and that the magic hat and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.660" end="00:58:23.260" style="s2">place the magic hat on each person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.309" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">head and then you decide which are they</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.260" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">Gryffindor Hufflepuff or so forth people</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:29.950" style="s2">want magic and they want to know which</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:31.660" style="s2">type of character they are and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.950" end="00:58:33.670" style="s2">they&#39;re going to pursue technologies</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.660" end="00:58:37.180" style="s2">which would enhance themselves towards</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.670" end="00:58:38.890" style="s2">that direction so the argument is in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.180" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">in the enhancement world you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.890" end="00:58:43.210" style="s2">all different kinds of things at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">same time it&#39;s sort of like taking all</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.210" end="00:58:47.079" style="s2">the different colors of the rainbow and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:49.480" style="s2">then finger-painting on a paper it comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.079" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">out gray so what happens is that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.480" end="00:58:54.609" style="s2">have to shape their identities in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:57.730" style="s2">form of the archetypes that they&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.609" end="00:59:01.089" style="s2">value and they&#39;re going to be pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.730" end="00:59:03.160" style="s2">those kinds of mutant powers cool very</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.089" end="00:59:05.650" style="s2">cool that&#39;s a great transition point to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.160" end="00:59:08.440" style="s2">my next topic which is you wrote a paper</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.650" end="00:59:11.859" style="s2">where you briefly laid out a framework</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.440" end="00:59:13.779" style="s2">of meaning evangelizing meaning applying</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.859" end="00:59:16.630" style="s2">and then you spent mostly effort on</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.779" end="00:59:19.029" style="s2">meaning making if we&#39;re gonna go into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.630" end="00:59:21.130" style="s2">world where you know we are headed</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.029" end="00:59:23.730" style="s2">towards transhumanism or make the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.130" end="00:59:25.869" style="s2">principal decision not to write</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.730" end="00:59:29.529" style="s2">presumably some of that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.869" end="00:59:33.039" style="s2">based on what meanings we have adhered</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.529" end="00:59:33.819" style="s2">to us right what memes space entities</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.039" end="00:59:35.709" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.819" end="00:59:38.920" style="s2">you might call put a lot of religion or</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.709" end="00:59:40.839" style="s2">culture or social norms and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.920" end="00:59:41.739" style="s2">that comes from meaning so could you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.839" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">take us a little bit through your</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.739" end="00:59:46.180" style="s2">theories of meaning and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">with your focus on meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.180" end="00:59:50.769" style="s2">maybe see we can tie that back to this</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:53.559" style="s2">possible organic transhumanist epoch</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.769" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">that we could be entering absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.559" end="00:59:59.949" style="s2">that was a great question I love the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="01:00:02.170" style="s2">that flowed so talking about meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.949" end="01:00:06.190" style="s2">making so just so that the general</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.170" end="01:00:09.910" style="s2">public knows this there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.190" end="01:00:12.729" style="s2">major academic camps out there that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.910" end="01:00:18.039" style="s2">fighting for a social science of this</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.729" end="01:00:19.930" style="s2">that isn&#39;t radically subjective so most</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.039" end="01:00:21.400" style="s2">people think you only have two options</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.930" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">that basically either you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.400" end="01:00:25.959" style="s2">Objectivist and everything is real and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:28.779" style="s2">everything follows a strict ontology</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.959" end="01:00:32.349" style="s2">right a strict system of categories and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.779" end="01:00:32.949" style="s2">taxonomy x&#39; or you&#39;re out here in la-la</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.349" end="01:00:34.749" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.949" end="01:00:37.089" style="s2">where nobody understands each other and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.749" end="01:00:39.160" style="s2">we&#39;re all radically subjective but what</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.089" end="01:00:42.339" style="s2">happens is that there&#39;s this what we</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.160" end="01:00:44.709" style="s2">call weak social construction and weak</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.339" end="01:00:46.959" style="s2">social construction is a system where</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.709" end="01:00:51.940" style="s2">you have to work within the rules of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.959" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">reality but group consensus has a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.940" end="01:00:57.789" style="s2">big impact on culture and society and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:01:00.789" style="s2">there&#39;s many stable equilibria that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.789" end="01:01:03.459" style="s2">possible so multiple stable realities</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.789" end="01:01:07.630" style="s2">not infinite stable realities this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.459" end="01:01:10.749" style="s2">the important point there are some right</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.630" end="01:01:12.969" style="s2">and so what people who work within this</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.749" end="01:01:15.789" style="s2">weak social construction camp is they</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.969" end="01:01:20.229" style="s2">look at theories of what is this small</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.789" end="01:01:24.449" style="s2">set of probable impossible social</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.229" end="01:01:27.219" style="s2">realities out of the infinite muck and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.449" end="01:01:29.769" style="s2">one of those theories is institutional</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.219" end="01:01:32.650" style="s2">theory and institutional theory came out</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.769" end="01:01:35.289" style="s2">of Thorstein Veblen work and some of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.650" end="01:01:37.239" style="s2">other early sociologists over a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.289" end="01:01:39.309" style="s2">years ago and what they were talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.239" end="01:01:40.959" style="s2">about is that people basically form</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.309" end="01:01:42.969" style="s2">groups and then when they&#39;re in those</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.959" end="01:01:46.940" style="s2">groups there&#39;s a certain level of group</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.969" end="01:01:50.750" style="s2">reality that&#39;s only it&#39;s true in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.940" end="01:01:52.760" style="s2">place in that set of relationships but</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.750" end="01:01:55.310" style="s2">if you are external to those sets of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.760" end="01:01:58.609" style="s2">relationships that aspect of reality is</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.310" end="01:02:00.619" style="s2">irrelevant so it&#39;s a localized reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.609" end="01:02:02.420" style="s2">and anyone who&#39;s ever been in a company</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.619" end="01:02:04.190" style="s2">or an organization knows that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.420" end="01:02:06.650" style="s2">local culture right</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.190" end="01:02:08.349" style="s2">of course it&#39;s not that nutty it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.650" end="01:02:11.180" style="s2">that hard to wrap your head around but</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.349" end="01:02:13.099" style="s2">it&#39;s also profound because very</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.180" end="01:02:15.770" style="s2">interesting things can happen in those</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.099" end="01:02:17.569" style="s2">spaces and so the argument is this the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.770" end="01:02:19.609" style="s2">institutional theory has says that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.569" end="01:02:22.069" style="s2">there&#39;s certain dominant institutional</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.609" end="01:02:24.589" style="s2">logics that&#39;s what they call it</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.069" end="01:02:27.650" style="s2">institutional logics and what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.589" end="01:02:29.540" style="s2">that when you&#39;re in a certain period of</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.650" end="01:02:32.569" style="s2">human history or if you&#39;re in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.540" end="01:02:34.490" style="s2">social organization these institutional</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.569" end="01:02:36.589" style="s2">logics will dominate they are going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.490" end="01:02:40.569" style="s2">be the ways that people make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.589" end="01:02:44.060" style="s2">the world there and that when the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.569" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2">institutional logics change that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.060" end="01:02:49.550" style="s2">social order changes and then people use</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.400" end="01:02:52.579" style="s2">that new logic as the new normal okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.550" end="01:02:55.369" style="s2">and one of those examples is often given</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.579" end="01:02:58.910" style="s2">is like you know in during during</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.369" end="01:03:02.119" style="s2">modernity people believe that basically</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.910" end="01:03:05.900" style="s2">that capitalism was a force for good</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.119" end="01:03:08.829" style="s2">predominantly and so any logic related</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.900" end="01:03:12.500" style="s2">to capitalist thinking would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.829" end="01:03:14.030" style="s2">normalized that&#39;s just a vague example</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.500" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s true that&#39;s one of the examples</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.030" end="01:03:18.950" style="s2">they like to focus on is whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:21.470" style="s2">you have a normal sense of normal about</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.950" end="01:03:23.030" style="s2">those things and those logics are going</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.470" end="01:03:26.050" style="s2">to change when you go into the sixth</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.030" end="01:03:29.869" style="s2">paradigm okay now meaning making</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.050" end="01:03:33.020" style="s2">concerns how those new meanings are made</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.869" end="01:03:34.369" style="s2">on the high level so on the paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.020" end="01:03:36.140" style="s2">addict level when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.369" end="01:03:37.970" style="s2">people who are going to have a big</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.140" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">impact on the on everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.970" end="01:03:42.800" style="s2">those are meaning makers they&#39;re super</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:44.990" style="s2">actors they&#39;re people who have more</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.800" end="01:03:48.170" style="s2">power than everybody else does in terms</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.990" end="01:03:52.010" style="s2">of shaping the beliefs of the social</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.170" end="01:03:54.589" style="s2">system and the idea is that meaning</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.010" end="01:03:56.720" style="s2">making is the study of the literal</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.589" end="01:04:00.260" style="s2">process by which the new meanings are</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.720" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">made which then become the new normal</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.260" end="01:04:06.140" style="s2">then those meanings structure</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:08.450" style="s2">sense-making for everybody else and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.140" end="01:04:10.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of an imprinting process</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.450" end="01:04:13.990" style="s2">and that imprinting means that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.490" end="01:04:16.700" style="s2">individuals have some effect on history</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.990" end="01:04:18.500" style="s2">the personality of Steve Jobs for</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.700" end="01:04:21.890" style="s2">example had some effect on the company</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.500" end="01:04:25.310" style="s2">Apple so there is an imprinting process</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.890" end="01:04:28.100" style="s2">when super actors in society advanced</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.310" end="01:04:30.740" style="s2">new meanings what my work does is it</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.100" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">talks about meanings as existing in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.740" end="01:04:36.290" style="s2">belief network so the idea is that think</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.040" end="01:04:38.120" style="s2">about society as a cloud of beliefs just</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.290" end="01:04:40.820" style="s2">like how people like to draw the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.120" end="01:04:45.650" style="s2">Internet as a cloud to say it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.820" end="01:04:48.190" style="s2">massive cloud of beliefs and that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.650" end="01:04:52.220" style="s2">meaning makers are people who have</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.190" end="01:04:54.740" style="s2">social position in the network that they</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.220" end="01:04:57.290" style="s2">can then restructure not only the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.740" end="01:05:00.230" style="s2">generally accepted logics but also the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.290" end="01:05:02.120" style="s2">network itself and the structure of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.230" end="01:05:04.250" style="s2">network and how beliefs flow through it</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.120" end="01:05:06.680" style="s2">and so forth and in my paper what I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.250" end="01:05:09.290" style="s2">identified was six super actors that had</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.680" end="01:05:12.710" style="s2">the most important role in shaping</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.290" end="01:05:16.040" style="s2">culture during a paradigm and you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.710" end="01:05:17.660" style="s2">basically creators who create a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.040" end="01:05:19.670" style="s2">those ideas but they&#39;re usually not the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.660" end="01:05:22.370" style="s2">same people who share them and normalize</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.670" end="01:05:24.560" style="s2">them so you&#39;ve creators then you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.370" end="01:05:28.790" style="s2">curators and curators are those people</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.560" end="01:05:32.060" style="s2">who curate and manage meanings and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.790" end="01:05:34.130" style="s2">means that they manage audiences so just</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.060" end="01:05:36.440" style="s2">like you have a podcast audience you are</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.130" end="01:05:39.350" style="s2">a curator and you are managing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.440" end="01:05:41.210" style="s2">meaning making process and you are in</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.350" end="01:05:42.560" style="s2">some ways a super actor and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.210" end="01:05:45.250" style="s2">bringing together various different</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.560" end="01:05:47.780" style="s2">creators and they&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.250" end="01:05:49.580" style="s2">participate in meeting making by goke by</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.780" end="01:05:52.430" style="s2">working with you and with other curators</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.580" end="01:05:54.830" style="s2">right now you&#39;re also a creator to some</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.430" end="01:05:58.190" style="s2">extent as well so it&#39;s not that each</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.830" end="01:05:59.810" style="s2">individual is constrained holding one of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.190" end="01:06:02.870" style="s2">these roles there are some people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.810" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">play multiple roles but so anyway you</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.870" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">have the Creator curator relationship</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:10.670" style="s2">and so they need each other basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:12.500" style="s2">the curator has to attach those beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.670" end="01:06:14.050" style="s2">to specific audiences and make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.500" end="01:06:16.180" style="s2">them whereas the Creator</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.050" end="01:06:19.000" style="s2">have to discover the new meanings and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.180" end="01:06:21.040" style="s2">then help to evangelize those things a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.000" end="01:06:22.870" style="s2">little bit so anyway there&#39;s a sequence</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.040" end="01:06:24.280" style="s2">creators and curators are the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.870" end="01:06:26.770" style="s2">makers and then there&#39;s a meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.280" end="01:06:29.020" style="s2">evangelizing process and during the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.770" end="01:06:32.800" style="s2">meaning evangelizing process these</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.020" end="01:06:35.590" style="s2">beliefs have to be scoped out wide to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.800" end="01:06:38.860" style="s2">other groups to other audiences and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.590" end="01:06:42.510" style="s2">organizations and then there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.860" end="01:06:45.100" style="s2">scaling up of priorities so you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.510" end="01:06:47.470" style="s2">certain individuals who are evangelists</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.100" end="01:06:50.200" style="s2">who will take a particular idea and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.470" end="01:06:53.380" style="s2">prioritize it for their group or their</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.200" end="01:06:56.020" style="s2">affiliations and drive that up so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.380" end="01:06:59.140" style="s2">the evangelizing processes I call them</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.020" end="01:07:01.810" style="s2">networkers and evangelists and then in</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.140" end="01:07:04.840" style="s2">the third part I talk about signifiers</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.810" end="01:07:07.720" style="s2">and critics and what a signifier is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.840" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s a doer they put the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.720" end="01:07:13.840" style="s2">beliefs into practice rather than debate</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:16.530" style="s2">them derive them share them they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.840" end="01:07:19.900" style="s2">ones who are epitomizing that belief and</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.530" end="01:07:21.700" style="s2">so what happens is that once that person</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.900" end="01:07:23.530" style="s2">does it everybody else can model their</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.700" end="01:07:26.410" style="s2">behavior directly and imitate them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.530" end="01:07:28.930" style="s2">say okay so that&#39;s how we do it an</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.410" end="01:07:31.600" style="s2">example of a signifier for the beatnik</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.930" end="01:07:33.760" style="s2">community was Neal Cassady where</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.600" end="01:07:37.000" style="s2">basically you had beatniks who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.760" end="01:07:39.340" style="s2">writing about being beat but then they</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.000" end="01:07:40.900" style="s2">needed main characters who exemplified</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.340" end="01:07:44.110" style="s2">it and put those beliefs in the practice</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.900" end="01:07:47.980" style="s2">and so Neal Cassady was the guy who was</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.110" end="01:07:51.220" style="s2">their their epitome of beat you know and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.980" end="01:07:53.500" style="s2">so he was a signifier and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.220" end="01:07:55.480" style="s2">critics and critics are those people who</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.500" end="01:07:58.270" style="s2">butter their bread on rejecting or</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.480" end="01:08:00.280" style="s2">critiquing attempts to put those beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.270" end="01:08:03.100" style="s2">into practice and they&#39;re either gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.280" end="01:08:06.070" style="s2">criticize people on failing to live up</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.100" end="01:08:07.420" style="s2">to the theory or doing it wrong or</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.070" end="01:08:09.790" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna criticize the theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.420" end="01:08:11.380" style="s2">itself is failing and saying well we had</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.790" end="01:08:13.600" style="s2">this theory of how the world works but</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.380" end="01:08:16.420" style="s2">I&#39;m rejecting it because it didn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.600" end="01:08:19.240" style="s2">to work and so the argument is that this</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.420" end="01:08:22.359" style="s2">is the life cycle of meaning-making</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.240" end="01:08:25.030" style="s2">and that until you have all of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.359" end="01:08:26.920" style="s2">actor types fulfilled you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.030" end="01:08:28.839" style="s2">enough of a social movement</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.920" end="01:08:31.509" style="s2">to exemplify a change of meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.839" end="01:08:34.540" style="s2">society so it&#39;s a lifecycle that needs</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.509" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">to successfully run and uh say a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.540" end="01:08:38.980" style="s2">prototype phase and once you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:42.609" style="s2">prototype to set of beliefs and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.980" end="01:08:45.130" style="s2">got a complete cycle of social actors</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.609" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">who are representing that then you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.130" end="01:08:50.650" style="s2">start cloning those social movements and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:52.690" style="s2">repeating them again and again and</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.029" end="01:09:02.529" style="s2">same trajectory and now you have a</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.529" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">sense and of course I&#39;m assuming that</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.839" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">you are assuming that all this happens</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:12.489" style="s2">in a essentially Darwinian context right</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:14.890" style="s2">I&#39;m a medic propagation that you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.489" end="01:09:17.350" style="s2">some meanings don&#39;t take right somebody</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.890" end="01:09:19.330" style="s2">wakes up one morning with a grand theory</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.350" end="01:09:21.460" style="s2">of everything and they tell it to their</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.330" end="01:09:23.940" style="s2">wife and she laughs at him oh well that</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.460" end="01:09:26.949" style="s2">was the end of that meaning-making right</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.940" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">I could tell you well other meanings you</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.949" end="01:09:29.799" style="s2">go that didn&#39;t sound as crazy as I</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:31.779" style="s2">thought it might be and then it</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.799" end="01:09:34.330" style="s2">gradually finds two people that find it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.779" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">interesting etc and then you have 10 etc</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.330" end="01:09:39.489" style="s2">and then there&#39;s essentially a mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.589" style="s2">competition that goes on until you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.489" end="01:09:43.449" style="s2">recruit the various functional actors</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.589" end="01:09:45.730" style="s2">that you describe and that they can then</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.449" end="01:09:47.859" style="s2">rebroadcast and can up regulate the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.730" end="01:09:50.410" style="s2">signal in our game be world right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.859" end="01:09:52.179" style="s2">I&#39;m pushing really hard for people to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.410" end="01:09:54.790" style="s2">from theory to practice because until we</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.179" end="01:09:56.920" style="s2">have those prototype exemplars it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.790" end="01:10:00.280" style="s2">easy to say it&#39;s a goddamn talk fast and</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.920" end="01:10:02.260" style="s2">nothing more right exactly and you and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.280" end="01:10:05.310" style="s2">probably both have this bias towards</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.260" end="01:10:08.860" style="s2">prototypes I don&#39;t know but I know I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.310" end="01:10:11.469" style="s2">the idea is that if if I can&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.860" end="01:10:13.750" style="s2">prototype of an idea I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.469" end="01:10:15.460" style="s2">fully formed yet so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.750" end="01:10:18.580" style="s2">people who run around with idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.460" end="01:10:21.010" style="s2">fragments and a large part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.580" end="01:10:23.219" style="s2">meaning economy is to try to take these</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.010" end="01:10:26.080" style="s2">various fragments and compile them and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.219" end="01:10:28.600" style="s2">this is the reason why you can&#39;t simply</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.080" end="01:10:31.300" style="s2">develop a new society through analysis</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.600" end="01:10:33.310" style="s2">you need synthesis and you also need</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.300" end="01:10:34.989" style="s2">experimentation right complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.310" end="01:10:37.000" style="s2">you cannot see very far into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.989" end="01:10:39.730" style="s2">unfolding of a totally new complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.000" end="01:10:40.630" style="s2">system and so I&#39;ve strongly focused in</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.730" end="01:10:42.520" style="s2">on my own writing</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.630" end="01:10:44.590" style="s2">about the need to do probes at</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.520" end="01:10:47.350" style="s2">reasonable costs to learn from those</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.590" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">probes and to adapt and in fact in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.350" end="01:10:53.620" style="s2">game be world the first actual</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:56.679" style="s2">transition from individual actions and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.620" end="01:10:58.960" style="s2">theory we actually call a proto be right</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.679" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">the first form of game B that will</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.960" end="01:11:02.920" style="s2">actually exist in the world with you</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:04.840" style="s2">know at least dozens of people operating</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.920" end="01:11:07.060" style="s2">together in a game B fashion we</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.840" end="01:11:09.790" style="s2">literally call proto B because I want it</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.060" end="01:11:12.610" style="s2">to signal that hey this is an experiment</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.790" end="01:11:14.710" style="s2">it might go wrong also strongly suggest</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.610" end="01:11:16.659" style="s2">that we do multiple for adobe&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.710" end="01:11:19.620" style="s2">some of them will fail for all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.659" end="01:11:22.060" style="s2">reasons either systemic or idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.620" end="01:11:24.699" style="s2">absolutely and so there is this lovely</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.060" end="01:11:27.219" style="s2">phenomenon where this is a beautiful set</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.699" end="01:11:30.429" style="s2">by the way there&#39;s a lovely phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.219" end="01:11:34.360" style="s2">in the industrial revolution cycle that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.429" end="01:11:36.520" style="s2">there is a utopianist movement that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.360" end="01:11:39.730" style="s2">happens at the beginning of each of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.520" end="01:11:43.000" style="s2">these cycles and the utopianist movement</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.730" end="01:11:45.550" style="s2">is only somewhat motivated by technology</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.000" end="01:11:47.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s more motivated by the lifestyle</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.550" end="01:11:49.929" style="s2">promise that the promise that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.800" end="01:11:52.810" style="s2">going to be new sustainable ways of</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.929" end="01:11:54.190" style="s2">living and what happens is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.810" end="01:11:56.170" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s always people who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.190" end="01:11:59.170" style="s2">looking well into the future and hoping</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.170" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re looking for that that next</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.170" end="01:12:02.409" style="s2">big thing that&#39;s going to turn the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:05.830" style="s2">corner so that we can have the great</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.409" end="01:12:08.560" style="s2">society and so there&#39;s utopianist</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.830" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">movements and communalist living</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:12.360" style="s2">movements that explode at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:14.889" style="s2">of each Industrial Revolution and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.360" end="01:12:17.110" style="s2">Nicholas Christakis recently wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.889" end="01:12:20.739" style="s2">book about this called blueprint and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.110" end="01:12:23.110" style="s2">he&#39;s a he&#39;s a sociologist at Yale</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.739" end="01:12:25.690" style="s2">University and one of the observations</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.110" end="01:12:28.449" style="s2">that he made was that roughly every 50</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.690" end="01:12:30.850" style="s2">years there&#39;s this utopian experiment</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.449" end="01:12:32.560" style="s2">period now he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.850" end="01:12:34.540" style="s2">connection that that also happened to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.560" end="01:12:37.510" style="s2">the same time period of an industrial</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.540" end="01:12:39.639" style="s2">revolution but it is the case and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.510" end="01:12:42.420" style="s2">what happens is that like in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.639" end="01:12:46.060" style="s2">for example there was this utopianist</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.420" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">uptake of new communalism and you had</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.060" end="01:12:51.760" style="s2">everybody from one side of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:53.869" style="s2">to the other on one side had like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:56.449" style="s2">church of satan you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.869" end="01:12:58.550" style="s2">which was an emergence of the 1960s and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.449" end="01:13:03.080" style="s2">then on the other side you have these</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.550" end="01:13:04.699" style="s2">sort of like love cults you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.080" end="01:13:08.119" style="s2">can just have everything from biker</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.699" end="01:13:10.130" style="s2">gangs to - you know and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.119" end="01:13:13.460" style="s2">what happened is there was a explosion</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.130" end="01:13:16.670" style="s2">of you totally experiments and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.460" end="01:13:18.949" style="s2">was doing their part to participate in</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.670" end="01:13:20.780" style="s2">the grand social scheme even though</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.949" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">they&#39;re not thinking of that not all</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.780" end="01:13:24.170" style="s2">those people who did that we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:25.520" style="s2">about it as or running an experiment so</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.170" end="01:13:29.270" style="s2">that you guys can benefit from my</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.520" end="01:13:31.040" style="s2">failures necessarily walking around</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.270" end="01:13:32.810" style="s2">there thinking that way but as it just</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.040" end="01:13:34.699" style="s2">so happens from a bird&#39;s eye view that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.810" end="01:13:37.130" style="s2">exactly what they were doing they were</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.699" end="01:13:39.500" style="s2">trying thousands of different variations</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.130" end="01:13:41.719" style="s2">of the new world culturally and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.500" end="01:13:44.150" style="s2">figuring out what stuck and those things</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.719" end="01:13:47.150" style="s2">that stuck the most became normalized</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.150" end="01:13:50.540" style="s2">and were taken up into the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.150" end="01:13:52.880" style="s2">and some of those things had temporary</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.540" end="01:13:56.420" style="s2">importance they were really important</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:59.179" style="s2">for the emergent days so for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.420" end="01:14:01.310" style="s2">there was a lot of postmodern talk that</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.179" end="01:14:03.460" style="s2">was important we had to go through that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.310" end="01:14:06.489" style="s2">conversation we had to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.460" end="01:14:09.349" style="s2">postmodern relativistic thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.489" end="01:14:11.869" style="s2">radical individual perspective and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.349" end="01:14:14.599" style="s2">forth we had to go through that because</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.869" end="01:14:17.210" style="s2">that helped loosen the gears and helped</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.599" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">create the social movements but a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.210" end="01:14:21.770" style="s2">those things didn&#39;t have any longevity</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.040" end="01:14:23.210" style="s2">they got stuck or died in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.770" end="01:14:26.210" style="s2">Emergencies because they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.210" end="01:14:28.570" style="s2">designed for the growth phase those</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.210" end="01:14:31.159" style="s2">ideas which were well designed to scale</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.570" end="01:14:33.590" style="s2">were those ideas which became the new</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.159" end="01:14:35.389" style="s2">normal and were taken up during that</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.590" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">growth phase very much felt like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.389" end="01:14:39.619" style="s2">new corporations that are born during</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.040" end="01:14:42.170" style="s2">these time periods and those that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.619" end="01:14:44.210" style="s2">wealth like Apple Apple was fit to scale</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.170" end="01:14:47.090" style="s2">a lot of people will tell you that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.210" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">Apple was an unfortunate compromise</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.090" end="01:14:50.869" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t get to have all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:53.480" style="s2">lovely radical things that you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.869" end="01:14:57.380" style="s2">Steve Wozniak and most of the first</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.480" end="01:15:01.429" style="s2">generation computer geeks wanted but the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.380" end="01:15:02.989" style="s2">difference was that his his trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.429" end="01:15:06.170" style="s2">was scalable</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.989" end="01:15:07.489" style="s2">he understood culture right I knew was</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.170" end="01:15:09.380" style="s2">niak a bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.489" end="01:15:11.929" style="s2">ever met jobs but a very good friend of</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.380" end="01:15:13.550" style="s2">mine worked cheek-by-jowl jobs for 10</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.929" end="01:15:16.999" style="s2">years so I got a fair amount of jobs</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.550" end="01:15:19.489" style="s2">secondhand and yeah Wozniak had the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.999" end="01:15:21.110" style="s2">spirit of the hacker right but Jobs</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.489" end="01:15:24.499" style="s2">understood what it took to actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.110" end="01:15:27.710" style="s2">create a cultural revolution right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.499" end="01:15:30.499" style="s2">the idea has to do with people who live</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.710" end="01:15:32.119" style="s2">in the emergence phase it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.499" end="01:15:33.739" style="s2">Indian blind man and the elephant</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.119" end="01:15:35.150" style="s2">parable where you&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.739" end="01:15:36.440" style="s2">different sides of the elephant and</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.150" end="01:15:38.300" style="s2">whatever size the elephant you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.440" end="01:15:40.940" style="s2">touching you think that&#39;s what the whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.300" end="01:15:42.889" style="s2">object looks like well what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.940" end="01:15:46.309" style="s2">that if you&#39;re a part of the Cultural</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.889" end="01:15:49.309" style="s2">Revolution you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.309" end="01:15:50.929" style="s2">know you don&#39;t know what part of this of</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.309" end="01:15:53.269" style="s2">the overall social movement you really</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.929" end="01:15:55.309" style="s2">are and so wherever you&#39;re standing you</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.269" end="01:15:57.829" style="s2">think this is the thing I mean it makes</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.309" end="01:16:01.070" style="s2">sense to mean right it&#39;s what I like</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.829" end="01:16:03.380" style="s2">it&#39;s what motivates me and I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.070" end="01:16:06.230" style="s2">good and so Wozniak was one of those</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.380" end="01:16:08.659" style="s2">people who he knew the inherent value of</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.230" end="01:16:10.699" style="s2">open systems he knew the inherent value</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.659" end="01:16:13.039" style="s2">of the hackable systems all of that was</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.699" end="01:16:18.230" style="s2">very clear the Apple one and Apple two</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.039" end="01:16:19.820" style="s2">were technically convincing right there</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.230" end="01:16:21.739" style="s2">was nothing about it where you would say</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.820" end="01:16:22.840" style="s2">well that was a technical failure it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.739" end="01:16:25.369" style="s2">a technical success</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.840" end="01:16:28.369" style="s2">one of my favorite parts of that success</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.369" end="01:16:31.880" style="s2">was his invention of color using radio</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.369" end="01:16:33.769" style="s2">frequencies basically there was no other</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.880" end="01:16:35.719" style="s2">technology available at the time they</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.769" end="01:16:37.610" style="s2">could do color graphics for under a</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.719" end="01:16:40.070" style="s2">thousand dollars and he did it for a</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.610" end="01:16:42.499" style="s2">buck because he figured out how to hack</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.070" end="01:16:46.999" style="s2">a computer chip to make it give you the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.499" end="01:16:49.099" style="s2">color right and so we know he had the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.999" end="01:16:50.749" style="s2">technical know-how and that he could</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.099" end="01:16:53.119" style="s2">convince other engineers this is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.749" end="01:16:55.190" style="s2">direction that engineers want to go but</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.119" end="01:16:58.010" style="s2">what he didn&#39;t understand was the rest</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.190" end="01:17:00.860" style="s2">of society and their needs and so he was</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.010" end="01:17:04.820" style="s2">making a computer for the 2% of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.860" end="01:17:07.880" style="s2">who understood the value of having that</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.820" end="01:17:09.530" style="s2">deep control over the system and the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.880" end="01:17:11.530" style="s2">ability to build your own peripherals</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.530" end="01:17:15.199" style="s2">and the ability to expand and all that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.530" end="01:17:18.170" style="s2">but what Jobs understood was that that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.199" end="01:17:20.420" style="s2">was a face that was a period and it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.170" end="01:17:22.280" style="s2">a feeding frenzy of getting into the</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.420" end="01:17:25.550" style="s2">that what I call the paradigm attic</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.280" end="01:17:27.949" style="s2">level of design so what happened was</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.550" end="01:17:30.140" style="s2">that people who got into the paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.949" end="01:17:33.949" style="s2">attic level of design and technology in</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.140" end="01:17:36.050" style="s2">the 1970s had wonderful careers you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.949" end="01:17:38.120" style="s2">they went on they had the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.050" end="01:17:41.390" style="s2">write their own futures they could go</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.120" end="01:17:43.610" style="s2">around and the first gen adopters of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.390" end="01:17:46.010" style="s2">Wozniak technology would go around and</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.610" end="01:17:48.920" style="s2">be route designers and developers for</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.010" end="01:17:50.300" style="s2">for the whole paradigm because they knew</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.920" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">how it worked on the route level they</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.300" end="01:17:54.469" style="s2">understood the principles so</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:57.410" style="s2">fundamentally that they didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.469" end="01:18:00.290" style="s2">guess as they were innovating forward it</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.410" end="01:18:02.570" style="s2">all made sense to them intuitively but</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.290" end="01:18:05.270" style="s2">what Steve Jobs basically said is well</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.570" end="01:18:08.480" style="s2">ok that&#39;s good if you&#39;re a creator but</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.270" end="01:18:10.070" style="s2">I&#39;m what about if we go curator forward</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.480" end="01:18:11.660" style="s2">and we started thinking about all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.070" end="01:18:13.820" style="s2">audiences out there and what their needs</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.660" end="01:18:15.710" style="s2">are and what they&#39;re looking for and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.820" end="01:18:18.080" style="s2">forth and so what you end up finding out</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.710" end="01:18:19.130" style="s2">is that to cross the chasm you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.080" end="01:18:20.179" style="s2">everybody in the valley knows about</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.130" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">crossing the chasm</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.179" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">you got Geoffrey Moore Yeah right to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:29.270" style="s2">cross the chasm you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:31.940" style="s2">move away from just that lead user set</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.270" end="01:18:33.410" style="s2">of needs the lead user component and say</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.940" end="01:18:36.440" style="s2">well what&#39;s the other side of reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.410" end="01:18:39.670" style="s2">need and Jobs was one of those people</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.440" end="01:18:43.610" style="s2">who basically had that vision by the way</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.670" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">one historical clarification Jobs also</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.610" end="01:18:48.380" style="s2">had more help than probably anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:51.949" style="s2">in history ever in developing such a</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.380" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">company when he was developing Apple he</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.949" end="01:18:56.420" style="s2">spent a lot of time in conversations</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:58.250" style="s2">with with the who&#39;s who in the valley he</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.420" end="01:19:00.260" style="s2">was very good at doing his research and</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.250" end="01:19:02.900" style="s2">a lot of his ideas actually came from</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.260" end="01:19:05.780" style="s2">Intel a lot of people don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.900" end="01:19:08.390" style="s2">but basically he did these deep work out</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.780" end="01:19:09.380" style="s2">sessions with what&#39;s-his-name the mayor</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.390" end="01:19:12.080" style="s2">of Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.380" end="01:19:14.239" style="s2">Robert noise noise that&#39;s who I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:16.179" style="s2">thinking of so basically he stepped five</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.239" end="01:19:19.730" style="s2">weeks in Robert noises basement</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.179" end="01:19:21.500" style="s2">discussing the future of Apple and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.730" end="01:19:24.290" style="s2">direction of the technology and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.500" end="01:19:27.830" style="s2">strategy that he would have to employ</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.290" end="01:19:29.719" style="s2">over the next 10 15 years so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.830" end="01:19:31.850" style="s2">like he just dreamt this all up himself</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.719" end="01:19:33.300" style="s2">what he did is he went and talked to all</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.850" end="01:19:35.790" style="s2">of the creators and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.300" end="01:19:37.500" style="s2">since makers of the digital paradigm and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.790" end="01:19:40.290" style="s2">he did his homework and he said well I</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.500" end="01:19:42.240" style="s2">need to learn that logic so I can be</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.290" end="01:19:44.670" style="s2">consistent and true to it</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.240" end="01:19:46.620" style="s2">getting of course he also famously went</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.670" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">everywhere he went the Xerox PARC where</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.620" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">they made the mistake of showing him the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:52.230" style="s2">alto right which other graphic user</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:53.430" style="s2">interface with a mouse right and he goes</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.230" end="01:19:55.470" style="s2">aha</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.430" end="01:19:58.470" style="s2">so yeah he was a great synthesizer no</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.470" end="01:20:00.330" style="s2">doubt about it Oh in a book so the Dinah</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.470" end="01:20:02.730" style="s2">book that&#39;s one of my favorite science</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.330" end="01:20:06.090" style="s2">stories here about paradigms the Dinah</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.730" end="01:20:09.630" style="s2">book project Alan Kay he was the first</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.090" end="01:20:13.830" style="s2">person to do a PhD in computer science</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.630" end="01:20:15.810" style="s2">from Utah and he got to do a radical</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.830" end="01:20:17.730" style="s2">dissertation because it was a new field</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.810" end="01:20:21.270" style="s2">and he did her dissertation about a</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.730" end="01:20:24.270" style="s2">theoretical Dynabook that would be this</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.270" end="01:20:26.460" style="s2">new computing platform and design for</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.270" end="01:20:28.380" style="s2">the future and he knew it didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.460" end="01:20:30.360" style="s2">yet but his argument was this is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.380" end="01:20:33.180" style="s2">future that we&#39;re innovating toward it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.360" end="01:20:35.460" style="s2">the roadmap so he claimed that all</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.180" end="01:20:39.330" style="s2">personal computing technologies would</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.460" end="01:20:42.030" style="s2">eventually align on the roadmap to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.330" end="01:20:44.310" style="s2">dynamic well just so happens that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.030" end="01:20:48.330" style="s2">Dinah book is the iPad ok</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.310" end="01:20:50.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the iPad so Steve Jobs one of his</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.330" end="01:20:53.220" style="s2">relationships to CX part was Alan Kay</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.760" end="01:20:55.620" style="s2">who was there at that time and it was</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.220" end="01:20:58.320" style="s2">one of the ideas that he was exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.620" end="01:21:00.150" style="s2">he became aware of the Dinah book and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.320" end="01:21:02.220" style="s2">he wanted to see what the hell Alan Kay</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.150" end="01:21:03.510" style="s2">was working on because he said this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.220" end="01:21:06.570" style="s2">the guy who knows what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.510" end="01:21:08.190" style="s2">about and L&amp;K was one of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.570" end="01:21:12.510" style="s2">was developing the graphic user</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.190" end="01:21:14.910" style="s2">interface for the alto and that was a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.510" end="01:21:17.280" style="s2">side project it wasn&#39;t the major project</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.910" end="01:21:18.630" style="s2">of that that facility there&#39;s only a few</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.280" end="01:21:22.110" style="s2">people who are working on that</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.630" end="01:21:25.140" style="s2">particular project jobs requested to see</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.110" end="01:21:27.180" style="s2">him for a reason because he believed in</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.140" end="01:21:30.120" style="s2">the Dynabook as the future of Apple I</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.180" end="01:21:31.800" style="s2">loved it and an entire history of Apple</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.120" end="01:21:35.100" style="s2">he had a road map of where he was going</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.800" end="01:21:37.680" style="s2">and from day one they were setting out</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.100" end="01:21:40.080" style="s2">to build the Dynabook and that was their</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.680" end="01:21:41.820" style="s2">idea of the digital paradigm and once</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.080" end="01:21:44.040" style="s2">they achieved that they essentially</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.820" end="01:21:44.590" style="s2">reached a mixture phase for the company</p>

<p begin="01:21:58.630" end="01:22:02.830" style="s2">talk about exploration and exploitation</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.270" end="01:22:05.020" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s pretty damn good exploiter</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.830" end="01:22:06.820" style="s2">right he can increase those margins he</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.020" end="01:22:08.920" style="s2">can lower the quality of customer</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.820" end="01:22:11.830" style="s2">service just enough that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.920" end="01:22:12.280" style="s2">really remember profit margins go up you</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.830" end="01:22:14.800" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.280" end="01:22:16.869" style="s2">remember jobs had built a Macintosh</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.800" end="01:22:19.030" style="s2">plant in the United States and he was</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.869" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">quite committed the US manufacturing</p>

<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:26.170" style="s2">because you can save 12 cents by having</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.409" end="01:22:28.210" style="s2">it made in China right and if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.170" end="01:22:30.969" style="s2">believe that you&#39;re in the mature phase</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.210" end="01:22:33.219" style="s2">of an industry and a mature phase in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.969" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">paradigm that&#39;s exactly the right way to</p>

<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:42.699" style="s2">phase of the parado manic cycle you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.780" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">gonna see CEOs all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.699" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">looking like Tim Cook because that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:53.230" style="s2">manage companies that are in a mature</p>

<p begin="01:22:53.230" end="01:22:55.840" style="s2">absolutely true you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.550" end="01:22:57.460" style="s2">if I can actually wrote a paper or</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.840" end="01:22:59.800" style="s2">co-wrote a paper some folks at Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.460" end="01:23:02.380" style="s2">Institute on this that you have to be</p>

<p begin="01:23:06.280" end="01:23:11.260" style="s2">the company need to be hyper optimizers</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.889" end="01:23:13.090" style="s2">right yes absolutely you know to take</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.260" end="01:23:15.369" style="s2">some of this rhetoric oh we all have to</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.090" end="01:23:16.599" style="s2">be continuously disrupting wrong you</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.369" end="01:23:17.830" style="s2">have to have disruption at the right</p>

<p begin="01:23:17.830" end="01:23:22.030" style="s2">amount let&#39;s really drill that clean</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.290" end="01:23:23.949" style="s2">home because that&#39;s the whole theme here</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.030" end="01:23:27.550" style="s2">of this conversation that you and I are</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.949" end="01:23:29.739" style="s2">having is it&#39;s all about timing and this</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.550" end="01:23:32.560" style="s2">is a timing dominant perspective of</p>

<p begin="01:23:37.389" end="01:23:44.290" style="s2">then you need to align the capabilities</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.320" end="01:23:50.950" style="s2">absolutely in fact you know for instance</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.820" end="01:23:52.960" style="s2">I am gearing up as I always do to</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.950" end="01:23:55.150" style="s2">actually make some venture investments</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.960" end="01:23:57.730" style="s2">during the recession the best time to</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.150" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">make venture investments is about twelve</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.730" end="01:24:01.390" style="s2">months after the start of a recession</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:03.850" style="s2">for a whole bunch of reasons right so</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.390" end="01:24:05.230" style="s2">these cycles operate at every scale and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.850" end="01:24:07.240" style="s2">have different signals that are there</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.230" end="01:24:08.920" style="s2">let&#39;s do one last thing here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.240" end="01:24:11.260" style="s2">getting near the end of our time here I</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.920" end="01:24:12.940" style="s2">think maybe we&#39;ll tie together a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.260" end="01:24:16.180" style="s2">the points and also give you a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.940" end="01:24:18.790" style="s2">freelance a little bit we have your five</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.180" end="01:24:20.590" style="s2">previous transitions the concept that</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.790" end="01:24:23.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in the process of entering the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.590" end="01:24:26.380" style="s2">sixth into the organic paradigm also</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.400" end="01:24:28.990" style="s2">carload of Perez&#39;s idea which I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.380" end="01:24:31.660" style="s2">you share that lifestyle is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.990" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">key aspects that draws the products</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.660" end="01:24:37.210" style="s2">services and technologies forward into</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:39.490" style="s2">an actual new paradigm I&#39;d like to hear</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.210" end="01:24:43.360" style="s2">you speculate a little bit about what is</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.490" end="01:24:47.710" style="s2">the life style of the organic epoch</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.360" end="01:24:49.450" style="s2">gonna look like absolutely so on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.710" end="01:24:51.670" style="s2">cultural side it&#39;s always much more</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.450" end="01:24:54.540" style="s2">difficult to make firm predictions</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.670" end="01:24:57.070" style="s2">because as you and I discussed there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.540" end="01:24:59.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a rabid competition among</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.070" end="01:25:02.110" style="s2">cultural elements and concepts and</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.310" end="01:25:03.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of an execution issue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.110" end="01:25:06.360" style="s2">not just whether or not the idea was a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.880" end="01:25:08.920" style="s2">good idea but who actually executed well</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.360" end="01:25:11.440" style="s2">socially and was able to win the battle</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.920" end="01:25:13.270" style="s2">for prominence right and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.440" end="01:25:15.340" style="s2">definitely a lot of that but I will</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.270" end="01:25:18.490" style="s2">argue that if we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.340" end="01:25:21.370" style="s2">emergence phase of the sixth paradigm we</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.490" end="01:25:23.380" style="s2">have some strong contenders of who who</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.370" end="01:25:26.860" style="s2">may be some of the strong cultural</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.380" end="01:25:28.480" style="s2">concepts one of those is solar Punk okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.860" end="01:25:30.730" style="s2">because because look before you talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.480" end="01:25:32.050" style="s2">about the new normal for like 30 40</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.730" end="01:25:33.430" style="s2">years down the road the important</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.050" end="01:25:38.050" style="s2">question is who are the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.430" end="01:25:41.980" style="s2">transitioning us and so Solar Punk is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.050" end="01:25:44.020" style="s2">perspective that says we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.980" end="01:25:46.180" style="s2">makers we&#39;re going to be doers or are</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.020" end="01:25:48.940" style="s2">going to be hackers but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.180" end="01:25:51.850" style="s2">be operating in the new paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.940" end="01:25:54.220" style="s2">technologies predominantly and those are</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.850" end="01:25:55.330" style="s2">going to be solar those are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.220" end="01:25:57.790" style="s2">biohacking</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.330" end="01:25:59.080" style="s2">those are going to be trying to find</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.790" end="01:26:00.790" style="s2">ways to use</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.080" end="01:26:04.300" style="s2">Alexa T thinking and artificial</p>

<p begin="01:26:04.300" end="01:26:09.400" style="s2">which I want to point out service type</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.580" end="01:26:11.230" style="s2">robotics are a sixth paradigm technology</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.400" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">whereas the industrial type robotics</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.230" end="01:26:14.410" style="s2">were more fifth paradigm and that</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:17.080" style="s2">largely has to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.410" end="01:26:19.030" style="s2">decomposability perspective that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.080" end="01:26:23.140" style="s2">industrial robots have to be controled</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.030" end="01:26:26.260" style="s2">very precisely and they tend to not go</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.140" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">off message as much as service robots</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.260" end="01:26:30.610" style="s2">which needs to continually evolve and</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:32.770" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at creating learning</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.610" end="01:26:36.130" style="s2">robots that are going to go well beyond</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.770" end="01:26:38.350" style="s2">what their creators intent and so the a</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.130" end="01:26:39.910" style="s2">solar Punk is somebody who understands</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.350" end="01:26:42.130" style="s2">that all of these technologies have</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.910" end="01:26:44.590" style="s2">relationships to each other and that</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.130" end="01:26:48.910" style="s2">they&#39;re looking to create a combination</p>

<p begin="01:30:26.079" end="01:30:29.739" style="s2">so they would think about it in those</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.969" end="01:30:31.209" style="s2">terms and you would create these local</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.739" end="01:30:33.909" style="s2">experiments and then you would think</p>

<p begin="01:30:33.909" end="01:30:37.929" style="s2">the argument is we&#39;ve got several</p>

<p begin="01:31:39.130" end="01:31:45.429" style="s2">next we don&#39;t know the real details each</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.860" end="01:31:47.289" style="s2">group has its own viewpoint about what</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.429" end="01:31:49.420" style="s2">this might be but we all need to have</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.289" end="01:31:51.459" style="s2">system illogical modesty about</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.420" end="01:31:53.889" style="s2">predicting the unfolding of complex</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.459" end="01:31:55.630" style="s2">systems but we&#39;re all generally pointed</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.889" end="01:31:58.360" style="s2">in the same direction which I find to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.630" end="01:32:00.939" style="s2">very interesting that&#39;s right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.360" end="01:32:03.400" style="s2">mostly these are just different flavors</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.939" end="01:32:07.439" style="s2">and the same general theme and so my</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.400" end="01:32:09.789" style="s2">argument is when you have convergence of</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.439" end="01:32:11.739" style="s2">agreement on what you think the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.789" end="01:32:12.760" style="s2">themes of the future are you should you</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.739" end="01:32:15.310" style="s2">should take note because</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.760" end="01:32:17.920" style="s2">historically we&#39;ve had a very good track</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.310" end="01:32:19.270" style="s2">record of being correct about that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.920" end="01:32:21.940" style="s2">know people say well you can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.270" end="01:32:23.860" style="s2">the future and these these radical</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.940" end="01:32:25.870" style="s2">innovations and I say the hell you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.860" end="01:32:28.000" style="s2">if you go back and you look in history</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.870" end="01:32:30.400" style="s2">there always were people who had it</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.000" end="01:32:31.930" style="s2">pretty well mailed the question is</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.400" end="01:32:34.720" style="s2">whether or not they won the argument</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.930" end="01:32:37.660" style="s2">during their own time and so it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.720" end="01:32:40.680" style="s2">to necessarily know 50 years in advance</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.660" end="01:32:43.630" style="s2">which flavor is correct but the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.680" end="01:32:45.100" style="s2">futurists generally agree on the</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.630" end="01:32:47.380" style="s2">direction of these things look at Wired</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.100" end="01:32:50.910" style="s2">magazine in the 1990s and look at now a</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.380" end="01:32:53.860" style="s2">lot of the the savants of Wired magazine</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.910" end="01:32:56.320" style="s2">we&#39;re describing the kinds of movements</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.860" end="01:32:58.150" style="s2">that we are seeing now very good</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.320" end="01:33:00.610" style="s2">watch you have a final statement let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.150" end="01:33:02.650" style="s2">wrap it up well well I have a couple</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.610" end="01:33:05.020" style="s2">different things I&#39;d like to say so the</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.650" end="01:33:07.090" style="s2">first one is that the project that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.020" end="01:33:08.920" style="s2">working on I wanted to plug that again</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.090" end="01:33:12.490" style="s2">I&#39;m working on something that I call</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.920" end="01:33:14.110" style="s2">integral cycle theory and I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.490" end="01:33:16.480" style="s2">this is something that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.110" end="01:33:18.880" style="s2">sixth paradigm oriented basically so</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.480" end="01:33:22.360" style="s2">it&#39;s time for us to do this thing we</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.880" end="01:33:24.100" style="s2">need to do it and so we had complexity</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.360" end="01:33:26.770" style="s2">science that emerged as an</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.100" end="01:33:29.880" style="s2">interdisciplinary field around a certain</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.770" end="01:33:34.180" style="s2">set of ideas that were core to</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.880" end="01:33:36.310" style="s2">complexity study right well we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.180" end="01:33:38.800" style="s2">had cognitive sciences a revolution</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.310" end="01:33:40.360" style="s2">where people did interdisciplinary work</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.800" end="01:33:43.180" style="s2">around certain set of ideas that were</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.360" end="01:33:45.250" style="s2">important to believe and that ended up</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.180" end="01:33:48.220" style="s2">affecting a wide range of industries and</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.250" end="01:33:50.770" style="s2">disciplines what I&#39;m arguing is we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.220" end="01:33:52.810" style="s2">a period we need to do that again we</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.770" end="01:33:56.730" style="s2">need to create another interdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.810" end="01:34:00.640" style="s2">push and that push is to examine the</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.730" end="01:34:04.090" style="s2">cycles that we see in social reality and</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.640" end="01:34:06.490" style="s2">technical progress so that we can look</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.090" end="01:34:08.710" style="s2">very long-term into the future first of</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.490" end="01:34:10.990" style="s2">all but second of all because these</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.710" end="01:34:13.450" style="s2">things are driven by networks as well</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.990" end="01:34:15.880" style="s2">and what we didn&#39;t understand in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.450" end="01:34:18.100" style="s2">earlier phases of history when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.880" end="01:34:20.050" style="s2">doing Hegelian analysis of history and</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.100" end="01:34:22.180" style="s2">dialectic and so forth so we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.050" end="01:34:22.929" style="s2">actually understand how these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.180" end="01:34:27.010" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.929" end="01:34:28.719" style="s2">and now we very well do that social</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.010" end="01:34:31.269" style="s2">reality is organized in networks and</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.719" end="01:34:33.579" style="s2">those cycles are waves of innovation and</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.269" end="01:34:36.070" style="s2">diffusion as things filter through a</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.579" end="01:34:38.079" style="s2">network structure so you have s curves</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.070" end="01:34:39.969" style="s2">and you know various other different</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.079" end="01:34:42.039" style="s2">curves and so forth well the argument is</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.969" end="01:34:44.170" style="s2">a lot of these things look a lot like</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.039" end="01:34:46.110" style="s2">music if you&#39;re a music producer and</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.170" end="01:34:48.309" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna lay out your tracks on a</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.110" end="01:34:51.159" style="s2">digital audio workstation you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.309" end="01:34:54.130" style="s2">see dozens of loops and certain</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.159" end="01:34:55.929" style="s2">waveforms and so forth as a music</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.130" end="01:34:57.400" style="s2">musician that&#39;s how you would think what</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.929" end="01:35:00.969" style="s2">I&#39;m arguing is we can do pretty much the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.400" end="01:35:03.489" style="s2">same type of analysis using wave systems</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.969" end="01:35:06.010" style="s2">the reason why is that you can some</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.489" end="01:35:08.320" style="s2">waves mathematically speaking you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.010" end="01:35:10.360" style="s2">need to think about in dodging and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.320" end="01:35:12.340" style="s2">don&#39;t need to basically have the waves</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.360" end="01:35:13.570" style="s2">be produced by the other way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.340" end="01:35:16.209" style="s2">produced by the other way is produced</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.570" end="01:35:18.789" style="s2">daily waves because of a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.209" end="01:35:22.420" style="s2">convenience of how waves work you can</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.789" end="01:35:25.420" style="s2">just separate them in sum them and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.420" end="01:35:27.459" style="s2">basically if you work with wave systems</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.420" end="01:35:29.530" style="s2">and you work with network systems you</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.459" end="01:35:31.929" style="s2">can start creating massive simulations</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.530" end="01:35:34.599" style="s2">of futures you can start saying well</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.929" end="01:35:36.699" style="s2">here&#39;s what my integral wave theory</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.599" end="01:35:39.130" style="s2">predicts that we&#39;re going to have and</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.699" end="01:35:40.599" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna go draw a picture and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.130" end="01:35:43.269" style="s2">going to create a massive software</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.599" end="01:35:45.219" style="s2">simulation of a city or of a country or</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.269" end="01:35:46.840" style="s2">of a world system and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.219" end="01:35:48.280" style="s2">visualize that and then I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.840" end="01:35:51.249" style="s2">show you what would happen if these</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.280" end="01:35:53.050" style="s2">waves behave differently and so we can</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.249" end="01:35:56.889" style="s2">start doing massive simulations of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.050" end="01:35:59.559" style="s2">future using wave perspective and so my</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.889" end="01:36:01.059" style="s2">argument is we have people in various</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.559" end="01:36:02.769" style="s2">different disciplines who are working on</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.059" end="01:36:04.439" style="s2">little corners of this but they need to</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.769" end="01:36:06.610" style="s2">get together work with each other and</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.439" end="01:36:08.769" style="s2">some of the names you mentioned are</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.610" end="01:36:10.420" style="s2">people that I&#39;m wanting to work with so</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.769" end="01:36:12.459" style="s2">for example michelle balance is an old</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.420" end="01:36:15.010" style="s2">friend of mine and he&#39;s looking at peter</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.459" end="01:36:17.920" style="s2">churchians secular cycles right now and</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.010" end="01:36:22.179" style="s2">he&#39;s looking at how commons based</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.920" end="01:36:24.309" style="s2">movements reappear in cycles based on</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.179" end="01:36:27.610" style="s2">where you are in the peter church and</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.309" end="01:36:29.949" style="s2">secular cycle and he&#39;s arguing that he</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.610" end="01:36:32.979" style="s2">sees a commons based movement emerging</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.949" end="01:36:35.050" style="s2">now and what I&#39;m arguing is that we also</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.979" end="01:36:36.560" style="s2">see anarchist socialist movements emerge</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.050" end="01:36:38.210" style="s2">at the beginning of a techno-economic</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.560" end="01:36:40.490" style="s2">paradigm so we&#39;ve got a double</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.210" end="01:36:43.090" style="s2">confluence of events the Turchin cycle</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.490" end="01:36:45.710" style="s2">predicts it as well as the Carlota Perez</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.090" end="01:36:47.600" style="s2">predicts it okay so when you have a</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.710" end="01:36:49.010" style="s2">whole series of waveforms that are all</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.600" end="01:36:51.080" style="s2">basically telling you the same thing at</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.010" end="01:36:53.630" style="s2">the same time that&#39;s good news</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.080" end="01:36:56.330" style="s2">it means we know where we are in history</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.630" end="01:36:58.340" style="s2">so what I&#39;m trying to do is get these</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.330" end="01:37:02.000" style="s2">people to work with each other a little</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.340" end="01:37:03.830" style="s2">more than they had then to put down this</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.000" end="01:37:07.130" style="s2">whole promoting their side of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.830" end="01:37:10.460" style="s2">elephant in isolation and to create an</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.130" end="01:37:12.680" style="s2">interdisciplinary project where we try</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.460" end="01:37:15.800" style="s2">to understand the whole elephant using</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.680" end="01:37:18.380" style="s2">these theories that&#39;s my plug there and</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.800" end="01:37:23.150" style="s2">then my other point I wanted to make was</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.380" end="01:37:25.010" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got a media crisis going on</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.150" end="01:37:27.380" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t address that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.010" end="01:37:29.270" style="s2">have time to talk about kovat 19 and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.380" end="01:37:32.150" style="s2">sense-making crisis and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.270" end="01:37:34.880" style="s2">the sense-making crisis is predictive of</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.150" end="01:37:38.390" style="s2">the emergence of a new paradigm this</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.880" end="01:37:40.970" style="s2">happens every time we were having a an</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.390" end="01:37:43.880" style="s2">authoritarian wave right before the</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.970" end="01:37:46.400" style="s2">digital paradigm emerged we had this Red</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.880" end="01:37:47.930" style="s2">Scare in the Communists all of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.400" end="01:37:49.490" style="s2">various countries in the world were</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.930" end="01:37:51.410" style="s2">going to authoritarian and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.490" end="01:37:54.770" style="s2">control their media and using propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.410" end="01:37:57.020" style="s2">in a very heavy-handed fashion in 1964</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.770" end="01:37:59.630" style="s2">you had a free speech movement which was</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.020" end="01:38:01.510" style="s2">the early bellwether event which then</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.630" end="01:38:03.830" style="s2">kicked off a whole long series of</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.510" end="01:38:06.170" style="s2">sense-making processes that brought</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.830" end="01:38:09.410" style="s2">about the cultural side of the paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.170" end="01:38:12.680" style="s2">and exchange we have models that predict</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.410" end="01:38:14.600" style="s2">that&#39;s where we are now right so we have</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.680" end="01:38:16.670" style="s2">some pretty strong models that would</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.600" end="01:38:18.590" style="s2">base in political science and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.670" end="01:38:21.680" style="s2">that would say here we are at a</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.590" end="01:38:24.170" style="s2">journalism crisis that&#39;s happened before</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.680" end="01:38:27.770" style="s2">and it&#39;s happened for the same reasons</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.170" end="01:38:29.330" style="s2">at the same alignment as the last time</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.770" end="01:38:32.360" style="s2">we were going on undergoing a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.330" end="01:38:34.070" style="s2">revolution which was roughly a little</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.360" end="01:38:35.480" style="s2">bit ahead a little bit of a leading</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.070" end="01:38:38.630" style="s2">indicator of the technological</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.480" end="01:38:42.200" style="s2">revolution which then followed and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.630" end="01:38:44.810" style="s2">that repeat series of events has</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.200" end="01:38:46.520" style="s2">happened five times in a row and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.810" end="01:38:49.370" style="s2">every reason to think we&#39;re exactly in</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.520" end="01:38:50.130" style="s2">that juncture now and so we need people</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.370" end="01:38:53.070" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.130" end="01:38:55.560" style="s2">me and Michelle and so forth to do our</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.070" end="01:38:58.679" style="s2">job we got to get together and take this</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.560" end="01:39:00.960" style="s2">the the years of experience we&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.679" end="01:39:02.489" style="s2">working on all these great ideas so we</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.960" end="01:39:04.230" style="s2">can help the public understand where we</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.489" end="01:39:07.080" style="s2">are and where we&#39;re going to be going</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.230" end="01:39:09.590" style="s2">and that we shouldn&#39;t be a fearful of</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.080" end="01:39:12.870" style="s2">that and that we should be optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.590" end="01:39:16.130" style="s2">very good on that note we will wrap it</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.870" end="01:39:16.130" style="s2">up that&#39;s great stuff</p>
