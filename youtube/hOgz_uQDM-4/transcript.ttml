<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:11.099" style="s2">a lot of people say hello Jonathan so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.410" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">can see your face</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.099" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">hello everybody right I guess a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">people watching this will know who you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:19.230" style="s2">are already</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:22.580" style="s2">you you&#39;ve done quite a few public</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.230" end="00:00:26.779" style="s2">events with Jordan Pederson already and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.580" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">yeah you actually reached out to me to</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.779" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">to talk about the value of organized</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">religion and it&#39;s something I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:36.500" style="s2">any sort of firm views on so it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">really interesting subject to explore</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.500" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">but I&#39;d love to to start by talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">about the the recent Sam Harris Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">Peterson debates because I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">been quite vocal about your view of of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">how those have gone and whether they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">actually achieved anything and given</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">that they&#39;re sort of fairly recent I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.920" style="s2">think that would be a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">start and then move on to about personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.920" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">histories with Christianity the value of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:04.650" style="s2">organized religion and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">maybe unpacking a few of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.650" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">around the kind of ambivalence of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s reawakening or re</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">understanding of some of the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">tradition and then that relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">organized church and whether yeah that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">sort of sent some tensions there that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">I&#39;m fine I&#39;m kind of interested to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">explore yeah yeah first of all thanks</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.810" end="00:02:28.330" style="s2">explore my friend and colleague Ali is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:29.890" style="s2">an expert on Gnosticism or researched it</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.870" end="00:02:34.360" style="s2">quite a lot so he&#39;d love to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.400" end="00:02:36.580" style="s2">conversation with you at some point</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.360" end="00:02:38.110" style="s2">about Gnosticism I know yeah sure I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.580" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">would look I would love to do that too</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.110" end="00:02:42.100" style="s2">like I think I&#39;m for sure it&#39;s it is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:44.020" style="s2">is for sure I do have a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.100" end="00:02:45.670" style="s2">perspective on Gnosticism and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.020" end="00:02:48.130" style="s2">the let&#39;s say the Christian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:48.730" style="s2">on narcissism is polemical that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.130" end="00:02:50.980" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.730" end="00:02:53.080" style="s2">and so so I kind of understand that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.980" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">so I would be happy to to talk with</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.080" end="00:02:56.650" style="s2">somebody who studied it more and and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">kind of Duke it out and have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.650" end="00:03:03.459" style="s2">discussion that it&#39;d be great to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.600" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">great cool yeah you&#39;ve said a few really</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.459" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">insight exciting things there that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:10.300" style="s2">want to just question I mean you you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:13.270" style="s2">talked about this thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.300" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a lot of I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.270" end="00:03:16.330" style="s2">I sense on a sort of broad scale is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:18.820" style="s2">there is a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.330" end="00:03:20.650" style="s2">awakening facilitated by the internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.820" end="00:03:22.420" style="s2">and the kind of the new media the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.650" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">ability to go down as many rabbit holes</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.420" end="00:03:29.019" style="s2">as we want yeah but how would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">summarize it I think so I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.019" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">think what&#39;s going on I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">also something that&#39;s going on it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:36.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of reached the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:40.420" style="s2">certain cycle or we reach the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.670" end="00:03:44.320" style="s2">certain time where we kind of moved into</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.420" end="00:03:46.209" style="s2">a kind of nihilism you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.320" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">everybody all they wanted was to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.209" end="00:03:49.530" style="s2">know to have the nice car and to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:51.850" style="s2">you know a kind of superficial</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.530" end="00:03:53.709" style="s2">superficiality and we saw that in in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.850" end="00:03:56.170" style="s2">news and in the way that we&#39;ve been fed</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.709" end="00:03:58.870" style="s2">media for the past you know 10 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.170" end="00:04:00.730" style="s2">where you know we&#39;ve been told how our</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.870" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">attention span is shrinking and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.730" end="00:04:05.110" style="s2">we need to have these 10-minute bits and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">then advertisements and and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.110" end="00:04:08.800" style="s2">see it on TV still like it still has</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:10.570" style="s2">that model where they they have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.800" end="00:04:11.739" style="s2">little short tidbits of things that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.570" end="00:04:13.390" style="s2">present you and then they kind of move</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.739" end="00:04:16.150" style="s2">from one thing to the next and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.390" end="00:04:17.229" style="s2">that what we&#39;re seeing is is we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.150" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">reached the end of that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.229" end="00:04:20.769" style="s2">just not true that that&#39;s what human</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.790" end="00:04:22.750" style="s2">beings are we&#39;re just not we&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.769" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">that and so it&#39;s actually pushing us in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.750" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">a direct you know it can it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">could say something like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:30.520" style="s2">likes to eat chocolate cake and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">give someone chocolate cake like they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.520" end="00:04:32.740" style="s2">love it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:34.810" style="s2">obviously they&#39;ll want to have more but</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.740" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">if you eat chocolate cake for two days</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">at some point you just get totally</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">saturated and you want to have some</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:43.450" style="s2">veggies and I think that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:44.710" style="s2">is that they&#39;ve the the the media</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.450" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">companies thought that they could just</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.710" end="00:04:48.310" style="s2">give us this candy forever</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2">but at some point people just got</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.310" end="00:04:51.730" style="s2">completely fed up and now they want</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:54.460" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.730" end="00:04:55.540" style="s2">deeper and a bit more intense and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.460" end="00:04:57.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting it from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.540" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">universities for anybody who studied in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.160" end="00:05:00.940" style="s2">university it&#39;s so ideological</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:03.550" style="s2">especially the humanities it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:05.740" style="s2">ideological there&#39;s so little room for</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.550" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">actual engagement in actual discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.740" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">actual plunging into the text of Western</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:16.600" style="s2">history that people are looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">on the Internet and luckily we have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.600" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">interesting people that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:21.970" style="s2">coming up I think and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.780" end="00:05:24.040" style="s2">Jordan Pederson has been someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.970" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">kind of filled fill that a place but</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.040" end="00:05:27.730" style="s2">there are some people they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2">the big as much following is Jordan but</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.730" end="00:05:30.970" style="s2">you&#39;ll find philosophers online that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.620" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">have you know fifty thousand followers</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:09.400" style="s2">of different perspectives because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.500" end="00:06:11.530" style="s2">Harris is obviously the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.400" end="00:06:14.320" style="s2">foremost advocate for the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.530" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">paradigm which I at least would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.320" end="00:06:23.800" style="s2">say is partly what has led to the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:26.980" style="s2">of the sense of a lack of felt meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.800" end="00:06:28.750" style="s2">in people lives yeah I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.980" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">great line that sorry I&#39;ll just okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.750" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a great line of a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">came up with recently which was he said</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">scientism is worse than jihadism because</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:41.770" style="s2">jihadism doesn&#39;t create you</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.750" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">weapons yeah exactly that&#39;s yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.770" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">is a kind of I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:48.790" style="s2">interesting to see it kind of from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:51.940" style="s2">outside is to see in a lot of the this</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.790" end="00:06:53.830" style="s2">kind of New Atheists bunch a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.940" end="00:06:56.920" style="s2">blindness and in a kind of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.830" end="00:06:58.870" style="s2">which you actually do discover in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.920" end="00:07:00.820" style="s2">Jobos witnesses for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.870" end="00:07:03.550" style="s2">like this kind of absolute certainty of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.820" end="00:07:05.980" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and also a pros like</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">a like a proselytizing where they just</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.980" end="00:07:10.660" style="s2">kind of want to convince you of their of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:12.490" style="s2">their thing and so it&#39;s really funny -</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.660" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">it&#39;s funny - guys it&#39;s funny to see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.490" end="00:07:17.530" style="s2">but it is kind of frightening to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:19.150" style="s2">like you said that behind behind you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.530" end="00:07:20.590" style="s2">hope as witnesses all you have are</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.150" end="00:07:23.380" style="s2">really annoying conversations at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.590" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">door but behind behind scientism you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.380" end="00:07:27.460" style="s2">have artificial intelligence you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:29.530" style="s2">all these things like the the the trans</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.460" end="00:07:31.570" style="s2">human is for example I mean they&#39;re it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.530" end="00:07:35.320" style="s2">frightening how they&#39;re not they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.570" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">have wisdom to to kind of understand the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.320" end="00:07:39.880" style="s2">the propositions that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:41.560" style="s2">this idea of putting you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.880" end="00:07:43.270" style="s2">electronic devices in the brain to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.560" end="00:07:44.950" style="s2">increase people&#39;s thinking and time</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.270" end="00:07:47.140" style="s2">Eris&#39;s for actually is for some of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.950" end="00:07:50.530" style="s2">stuff and and so it&#39;s like they they</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.140" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to understand the basic the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.530" end="00:07:54.850" style="s2">basic wisdom of humanity that how that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.110" end="00:07:57.220" style="s2">would be problematic they don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.850" end="00:07:58.750" style="s2">be able to see what that is um but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:07:59.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.750" end="00:08:03.130" style="s2">interesting at first you know when</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.890" end="00:08:04.570" style="s2">Jordan was trying to kind of engage with</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.130" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">Sam Harris I didn&#39;t totally understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.570" end="00:08:09.190" style="s2">why he was he was so adamant about doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">so because Jordan really did want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.190" end="00:08:14.890" style="s2">have this discussion with him um I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:17.470" style="s2">actually at Jordan&#39;s house at the second</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.890" end="00:08:19.390" style="s2">discussion that Jordan had with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.470" end="00:08:21.669" style="s2">Harris you know the first one was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.390" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">horrible when the two-hour like train</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.669" end="00:08:25.630" style="s2">wreck the second one wasn&#39;t so bad and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:27.220" style="s2">was actually at his house and we we went</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.630" end="00:08:28.990" style="s2">over like the first time Ayers debate</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.220" end="00:08:30.820" style="s2">with his son and and Jordan we watched</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.990" end="00:08:32.530" style="s2">we like we like listened to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.820" end="00:08:33.969" style="s2">thing then we kind of analyzed it where</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.530" end="00:08:35.740" style="s2">did it go wrong and everything so Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.969" end="00:08:39.520" style="s2">was really is really adamant about Sam</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.740" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">and I kept wondering why him like why</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.520" end="00:08:43.330" style="s2">him and I think I know what it is I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">think I think because there is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.330" end="00:08:48.910" style="s2">in Sam Harris which represents a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:08:51.649" style="s2">beginning of a transition it&#39;s there in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.910" end="00:08:54.949" style="s2">him because of all the new atheist types</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.649" end="00:08:56.869" style="s2">he he has had spiritual experiences now</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.949" end="00:08:58.309" style="s2">and he can&#39;t discount them like he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.869" end="00:09:00.379" style="s2">pretend like those are meaningless he</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.309" end="00:09:03.350" style="s2">knows how meaningful they are and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.379" end="00:09:05.480" style="s2">because of that he he does have a desire</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:08.600" style="s2">to recover something of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.480" end="00:09:10.730" style="s2">tradition it&#39;s just that he still has</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.600" end="00:09:12.769" style="s2">like it&#39;s like he&#39;s kind of has a one</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.730" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">foot in two worlds and he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.769" end="00:09:17.240" style="s2">figure it out it&#39;s as if Jordan also has</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">his foot in two worlds right Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.240" end="00:09:21.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t totally on the religious side or</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:22.759" style="s2">on the scientific side it&#39;s just that so</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.170" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">they both have their foot in two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.759" end="00:09:25.999" style="s2">it&#39;s just that maybe one is pulling more</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:27.499" style="s2">on one side and the other is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.999" end="00:09:29.480" style="s2">pulling more on the other when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.499" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">saying there is value there&#39;s more value</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.480" end="00:09:33.290" style="s2">than you think in the religious aspect</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:34.819" style="s2">and the other is saying there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.290" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">little value in the religious thing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.819" end="00:09:39.019" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s that&#39;s worthy is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.290" style="s2">discussions about consciousness and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.019" end="00:09:43.369" style="s2">you know especially Eastern or mystical</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.290" end="00:09:46.579" style="s2">experiences like that&#39;s all that matters</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.369" end="00:09:48.019" style="s2">and so I think that that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.579" end="00:09:50.809" style="s2">that that&#39;s why the discussion has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.019" end="00:09:54.259" style="s2">so engaging for people people have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.809" end="00:09:55.639" style="s2">so wanting to to follow it because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.259" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">think people are trying to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.639" end="00:10:01.699" style="s2">out they&#39;re trying to to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:03.110" style="s2">because every I think most people do</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.699" end="00:10:04.970" style="s2">have an intuitive sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.110" end="00:10:06.620" style="s2">more like there&#39;s any to ative sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.970" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about our being</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.620" end="00:10:10.249" style="s2">in the world which has meaning which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">and you have to actually work really</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.249" end="00:10:14.899" style="s2">hard to to destroy that to just be a and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.610" style="s2">most people who do that they they</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.899" end="00:10:19.309" style="s2">actually are deluding themselves cuz</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.610" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">they say that they&#39;re just monkeys you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.309" end="00:10:23.089" style="s2">know and they&#39;re they&#39;re just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:25.399" style="s2">monkeys who are saying things but but if</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.089" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">you if you pay attention just a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.399" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">while to what they&#39;re saying you realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">that it&#39;s not true they have hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:32.269" style="s2">of values they have they have spirits to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:35.059" style="s2">which they pray they don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.269" end="00:10:36.709" style="s2">that they&#39;re praying to to certain God</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.059" end="00:10:38.329" style="s2">but they&#39;re there at the altar of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.709" end="00:10:38.870" style="s2">certain gods and they&#39;re there there</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.329" end="00:10:40.370" style="s2">there there</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">sometimes even possessed by those</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.370" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">spirits you know and so so I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:48.740" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s been so interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">people to to follow this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.740" end="00:10:52.819" style="s2">that&#39;s the discussion that people want</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.439" style="s2">to hear now because we it&#39;s like we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.819" end="00:10:56.629" style="s2">we&#39;re in a moment where we have a loss</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.439" end="00:10:59.720" style="s2">of meaning we everybody&#39;s experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.629" end="00:11:02.540" style="s2">it like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.720" end="00:11:04.309" style="s2">chaos of meaning a chaos of identity a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.540" end="00:11:05.540" style="s2">sense that things are crumbling or</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.309" end="00:11:07.579" style="s2">things or we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.540" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">anymore together we live in our little</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.180" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">don&#39;t so so all that is is real and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:18.190" style="s2">people are looking for solutions to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:20.540" style="s2">in the discussion between Jordan Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.190" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">taking people just like one little step</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.540" end="00:11:27.560" style="s2">at a time towards figuring out what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:29.000" style="s2">means even in terms of translating it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.560" end="00:11:30.790" style="s2">a way that people who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.000" end="00:11:36.920" style="s2">scientifically minded could understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.790" end="00:11:38.570" style="s2">hmm yeah I do you have a sense of could</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.920" end="00:11:40.910" style="s2">I guess both of us share a sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.570" end="00:11:46.100" style="s2">think Peterson has a bigger perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.910" end="00:11:48.410" style="s2">on this than Sam Harris and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.100" end="00:11:51.620" style="s2">sense that those debates have gone I</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.410" end="00:11:53.389" style="s2">mean and do you have a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.620" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">would need to shift for Sam to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.389" end="00:11:59.329" style="s2">appreciate for example the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.649" style="s2">values have to be have to be rooted in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.329" end="00:12:02.209" style="s2">story for example I&#39;d say the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.649" end="00:12:04.910" style="s2">fundamental disagreements between them</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.209" end="00:12:08.060" style="s2">must pretty much that are they that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.910" end="00:12:09.769" style="s2">values have to be they can&#39;t be derived</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.060" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">rationally and they have to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.769" end="00:12:15.949" style="s2">more deep-rooted than that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s funny because at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.949" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">the London discussion its Sam who</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.959" style="s2">started to talk about consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">like towards the end of the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.959" end="00:12:30.290" style="s2">and I felt like ah this is the place</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:32.300" style="s2">this is the spot where the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.290" end="00:12:35.209" style="s2">the next step of the discussion needs to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.300" end="00:12:39.829" style="s2">happen the thing is that Jordan Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.209" end="00:12:42.500" style="s2">is Jordan doesn&#39;t hasn&#39;t studied a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.829" end="00:12:45.199" style="s2">let&#39;s say in terms of Eastern tradition</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.500" end="00:12:47.420" style="s2">terms of in terms of Buddhism and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.199" end="00:12:49.339" style="s2">even in terms of Christianity he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.420" end="00:12:53.810" style="s2">studied the mystical tradition so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.339" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2">and so the idea of not just having a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.810" end="00:12:58.519" style="s2">spiritual vision let&#39;s say but actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.350" end="00:13:01.160" style="s2">elevating your consciousness as we say</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.519" end="00:13:03.589" style="s2">or transforming your consciousness to to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.160" end="00:13:06.050" style="s2">become more to be freer to be to be less</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.589" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">bound by our multiplicities less bound</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.050" end="00:13:09.889" style="s2">by our passions all that stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">in the mystical tradition I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.889" end="00:13:14.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the key for Sam that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:18.769" style="s2">the discussion that is going to help him</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.260" end="00:13:20.899" style="s2">break break his</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.769" end="00:13:22.910" style="s2">way that he sees some of some of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.899" end="00:13:24.170" style="s2">stuff like what I would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.910" end="00:13:26.509" style="s2">like if I had a discussion with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.170" end="00:13:28.309" style="s2">Harris I would just say okay look I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.509" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">you don&#39;t like religion yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.309" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">religious that&#39;s fine let&#39;s not talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:32.420" style="s2">about that cuz gonna be a dead end let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:34.699" style="s2">talk about consciousness let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.420" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">about that and let&#39;s lay it out okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.699" end="00:13:40.629" style="s2">what does a world in which consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:43.369" style="s2">is central how does it lay itself out</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.629" end="00:13:45.139" style="s2">how does attention lay itself out</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.369" end="00:13:46.910" style="s2">right it laid itself out in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.139" end="00:13:48.619" style="s2">hierarchies terms of higher kids you</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.910" end="00:13:51.019" style="s2">have a point of attention and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.619" end="00:13:53.059" style="s2">around that point lay the world kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.019" end="00:13:55.699" style="s2">flows out into chaos which is on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.059" end="00:13:57.290" style="s2">edge even in your visual frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.699" end="00:13:58.879" style="s2">how it worked right so you have points</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.290" end="00:14:00.980" style="s2">of attention and then on the edges you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.879" end="00:14:03.529" style="s2">have this chaotic space which is which</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.980" end="00:14:06.199" style="s2">is kind of gray and not totally there so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.529" end="00:14:08.149" style="s2">you say okay so now let&#39;s take that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.199" end="00:14:10.369" style="s2">experience of consciousness and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.149" end="00:14:11.660" style="s2">say that that&#39;s the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.369" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">reality that&#39;s what he says he says</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.660" end="00:14:16.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the foundation of reality well is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:19.309" style="s2">there an analog to that in a community</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.360" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">what does that look like what does a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.309" end="00:14:22.579" style="s2">commute what does the analog of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:26.149" style="s2">consciousness in a community look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.579" end="00:14:27.740" style="s2">it looks like it looks like gathering</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.149" end="00:14:30.259" style="s2">together around a point</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.740" end="00:14:33.049" style="s2">looks like turning around appointed it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.259" end="00:14:35.899" style="s2">sits circumambulation it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.049" end="00:14:38.209" style="s2">it&#39;s a hierarchy of social of structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.899" end="00:14:40.129" style="s2">and it ends up looking like a religious</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.209" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">ritual that&#39;s what it looks like right</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.129" end="00:14:45.049" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s religious rituals</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.579" style="s2">are have the same structure as the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.049" end="00:14:48.019" style="s2">structure of consciousness so I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.579" end="00:14:50.389" style="s2">that that and then how does what does</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.019" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">that look like in time what does the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.389" end="00:14:53.899" style="s2">experience of consciousness to look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.740" end="00:14:56.929" style="s2">if you see it with the frame of time and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.899" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">what it looks like is a story it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.929" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">same and so I think that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:04.579" style="s2">would be the work that I think could</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.660" end="00:15:06.589" style="s2">kind of help Sam Harris move a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.579" end="00:15:08.629" style="s2">bit further down down the road I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.589" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">know he&#39;s he&#39;s actually also his whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.629" end="00:15:14.139" style="s2">world is his whole career his everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:17.869" style="s2">about him is caught up in his in his</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.139" end="00:15:18.769" style="s2">position and so you I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.869" end="00:15:20.389" style="s2">know if he&#39;d be willing to make that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.769" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">move I thought the debates themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.389" end="00:15:24.860" style="s2">were very frustrating I thought they</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:26.809" style="s2">were useful in the sense that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.860" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">that Jordan had a chance to say what he</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.809" end="00:15:29.959" style="s2">wanted to say and I think that people in</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:31.579" style="s2">the audience people are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.959" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">listening to it some of them are going</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.579" end="00:15:34.649" style="s2">to be rolling</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:36.300" style="s2">make the work to do the work some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.649" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2">some of the schemes that he laid out</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.300" end="00:15:40.649" style="s2">like the scheme of human sacrifice I</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:42.930" style="s2">thought was like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.649" end="00:15:45.389" style="s2">honest and you and you&#39;re honestly</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.930" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">attentive to what he&#39;s saying you will</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.389" end="00:15:51.300" style="s2">see how strong what he&#39;s laying out is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:52.829" style="s2">and how evolutionary correct like in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.300" end="00:15:55.740" style="s2">terms of just evolutionary thinking how</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.829" end="00:15:56.910" style="s2">correct what he&#39;s laying out is and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">think that some of the viewers will</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.910" end="00:16:00.360" style="s2">probably be willing to make the work I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:02.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know but for Sam</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.360" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">I think consciousness India I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.550" end="00:16:06.329" style="s2">I think he was gonna do a an interview</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:08.250" style="s2">with Don Hoffman I don&#39;t know if he did</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.329" end="00:16:10.649" style="s2">it but I think that someone like Don</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.250" end="00:16:12.389" style="s2">Hoffman could help Sam kind of move</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.649" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">forward like Don Hoffman I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.389" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">you know about about him did you follow</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:19.649" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.649" end="00:16:23.339" style="s2">phenomenology of consciousness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.170" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of basically saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.339" end="00:16:26.730" style="s2">the way that you get you you try and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:27.899" style="s2">argue some heresy the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.730" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">consciousness what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.899" end="00:16:32.129" style="s2">because that&#39;s what he says that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">he says is the basis of reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.129" end="00:16:37.290" style="s2">thing is that the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:39.870" style="s2">consciousness doesn&#39;t actually transfer</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.290" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">easily into scientific thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.870" end="00:16:43.380" style="s2">actually scientific thinking is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">quite far from phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.380" end="00:16:47.579" style="s2">consciousness phenomenological conscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:49.259" style="s2">actually looks way more like a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.579" end="00:16:52.290" style="s2">primitive vision of the world where</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.259" end="00:16:54.750" style="s2">there&#39;s up there&#39;s down you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.290" end="00:16:56.130" style="s2">your whole experience is there to tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.750" end="00:16:57.899" style="s2">you when you&#39;re up and down because when</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.130" end="00:17:00.029" style="s2">your head is upside down you don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.899" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">right you know you don&#39;t feel right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.029" end="00:17:03.870" style="s2">so that your whole body and your whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">experience is there to experience heaven</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.870" end="00:17:09.270" style="s2">and earth and is there to experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:12.270" style="s2">time and is there to experience also</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.270" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">limited attention and then a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.270" end="00:17:15.720" style="s2">of attention and and that&#39;s how we set</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:16.919" style="s2">up our communities everything set up</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.720" end="00:17:19.650" style="s2">that way so I would kind of move through</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.919" end="00:17:21.740" style="s2">that with him to to get him to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.650" end="00:17:24.270" style="s2">understand what these stories are about</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.740" end="00:17:25.260" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.270" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.260" end="00:17:30.179" style="s2">trying to do like my brother mature he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.780" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">wrote a book on cosmic symbolism in</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.179" end="00:17:33.270" style="s2">Genesis and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:35.309" style="s2">trying to do he&#39;s trying to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.270" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">back to consciousness and show you how</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.309" end="00:17:40.260" style="s2">the structures in in Genesis the stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:41.789" style="s2">are basically that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.260" end="00:17:43.500" style="s2">talking about you know the story in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.789" end="00:17:44.789" style="s2">Genesis the creation story it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.500" end="00:17:45.929" style="s2">that that&#39;s what it&#39;s talking about at</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.789" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">least in part I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.929" end="00:17:49.669" style="s2">have the use of word you have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.669" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">opening your eyes and then being self</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">aware and and then actually covering</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:57.990" style="s2">yourself to protect yourself from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">outer world it&#39;s like the whole story of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.990" end="00:18:00.929" style="s2">the fall</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:03.090" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.929" end="00:18:06.869" style="s2">consciousness it evens that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.090" end="00:18:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a sum it&#39;s a being who who acquires</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.869" end="00:18:11.309" style="s2">a certain type of consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.450" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">the effects of that consciousness on</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.309" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">that being I don&#39;t see how you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">it it&#39;s obvious that&#39;s quit it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">anyways yeah it&#39;s I think you also spoke</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:28.019" style="s2">to that it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard once someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:30.600" style="s2">has established a position written a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.019" end="00:18:34.740" style="s2">of books on a certain perspective to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.600" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">go through an experience of having to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.740" end="00:18:40.230" style="s2">change their minds I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:42.179" style="s2">a that&#39;s a big part of it but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.230" end="00:18:44.580" style="s2">think that it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.179" end="00:18:47.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not impossible in a way Sam Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.580" end="00:18:49.470" style="s2">also someone who is who is honest he has</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.850" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">these paths he has these weird patterns</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.470" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">that he falls into you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:56.639" style="s2">like Jordan Jordan was talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:19:00.119" style="s2">mean he laid out this amazing discussion</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.639" end="00:19:03.330" style="s2">about this this notion of of a mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.119" end="00:19:06.119" style="s2">process by which we identify the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.330" end="00:19:08.850" style="s2">man the ideal human and then we project</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.119" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">this ideal human and we represent him in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.850" end="00:19:13.350" style="s2">the dome of a church into heaven right</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.070" end="00:19:15.269" style="s2">of of your experience and then we look</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.350" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">up together towards that mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.269" end="00:19:19.019" style="s2">representation and then we see it as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">model by which we live our lives and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.019" end="00:19:23.100" style="s2">then sam harris is like yeah but what</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">about finding out fundamentalists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.100" end="00:19:26.159" style="s2">like that&#39;s all he could say was what</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:27.960" style="s2">about fundamentalist what about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.159" end="00:19:30.600" style="s2">like you&#39;re not this discussion is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.960" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">moving forward it&#39;s not in it you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.600" end="00:19:33.330" style="s2">do this with anything you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">with anything and I love when Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.330" end="00:19:39.659" style="s2">said do it take stories do it do it with</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.369" style="s2">the Hindu stories please Sam do it if</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.659" end="00:19:43.409" style="s2">you say that you can do it with anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.369" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">do it maybe it&#39;ll give you some insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.409" end="00:19:48.119" style="s2">into into how these stories work and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:50.279" style="s2">this stuff works and it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.119" end="00:19:51.990" style="s2">not all arbitrary and it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.279" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">just a bunch of stories we tell each</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.990" end="00:19:57.149" style="s2">other you you can&#39;t escape even if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:19:59.220" style="s2">enter into an evolutionary way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.149" end="00:19:59.850" style="s2">thinking you can&#39;t escape it everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:02.250" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.850" end="00:20:04.890" style="s2">to be within that so our stories have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.250" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">be part of it our concepts have to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.890" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">part of it everything has to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:08.850" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:11.940" style="s2">you can&#39;t just discount an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.850" end="00:20:13.500" style="s2">humanity as if it doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.940" end="00:20:15.150" style="s2">that means you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.500" end="00:20:17.309" style="s2">understand what it means what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.150" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">be human can&#39;t just say it&#39;s silly well</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.309" end="00:20:20.520" style="s2">you have to be able to it&#39;s there you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.549" style="s2">have to be able to talk about it because</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.520" end="00:20:25.860" style="s2">that&#39;s also part of of the yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.549" end="00:20:27.750" style="s2">say the the emergent phenomena like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.860" end="00:20:29.730" style="s2">have to be able to talk about it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.750" end="00:20:32.250" style="s2">and it also speaks to that paradox that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.730" end="00:20:34.770" style="s2">the Peterson points out about you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.250" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">either be an evolutionary thinker or you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.770" end="00:20:38.820" style="s2">can be an atheist who doesn&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">those two things fit together or you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.820" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">have to admit that religion has some</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">something this long-lasting and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:48.750" style="s2">must have some evolutionary benefit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:51.330" style="s2">and also the idea that for example that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.750" end="00:20:53.250" style="s2">we want to discount irrationality that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.330" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">we want to be rational it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.250" end="00:20:58.200" style="s2">well then you&#39;re not taking into account</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:21:00.179" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re irrational I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.200" end="00:21:01.890" style="s2">are obviously irrational to like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.179" end="00:21:03.330" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that we are and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.890" end="00:21:05.700" style="s2">much there are reasons there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.330" end="00:21:07.559" style="s2">purposes for our irrationality it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.700" end="00:21:10.200" style="s2">like irrationality contains the entire</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.559" end="00:21:12.390" style="s2">scope of human experience so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.200" end="00:21:15.030" style="s2">to say that that you can only filter the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.390" end="00:21:16.650" style="s2">world to rationality then you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.030" end="00:21:19.020" style="s2">definitely creating something which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.650" end="00:21:20.340" style="s2">going to be lopsided and and what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.020" end="00:21:22.110" style="s2">think and what Jordan thinks is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.340" end="00:21:25.830" style="s2">it&#39;s going to create a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.110" end="00:21:29.400" style="s2">result because you&#39;re you&#39;re unaware</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.830" end="00:21:32.429" style="s2">like you&#39;re totally unaware of what of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.400" end="00:21:35.880" style="s2">what the that other aspect of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.429" end="00:21:46.409" style="s2">is so yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.880" end="00:21:49.500" style="s2">very strange yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.409" end="00:21:53.070" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve heard I think in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.500" end="00:21:55.470" style="s2">the in those debates Sam calling what</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.070" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">what Jordan believes dangerous quite a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.470" end="00:22:00.570" style="s2">few times I maybe I haven&#39;t heard enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">Viktor does Jordan describe what Harris</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.570" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">believes are dangerous as well or is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">kind of a one-sided discussion on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.020" end="00:22:08.580" style="s2">on that front I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:12.930" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.580" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">I think it&#39;s will Sam&#39;s retort to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.930" end="00:22:18.990" style="s2">- Jordan is that you know all the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:20.700" style="s2">horrors of the 20th century and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.990" end="00:22:23.700" style="s2">say the late 19th and early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.700" end="00:22:25.860" style="s2">those were still religious so religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.700" end="00:22:28.170" style="s2">thinking that we&#39;re continuing you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.860" end="00:22:29.700" style="s2">and and I think that that&#39;s where Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.170" end="00:22:32.070" style="s2">kind of he once in a while he&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.700" end="00:22:33.870" style="s2">like a like a thing okay talk about Mao</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.070" end="00:22:35.910" style="s2">and Stalin and then Sandra toward his no</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.870" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">that&#39;s still religion and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.910" end="00:22:40.050" style="s2">Jordan hasn&#39;t totally figured out a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:41.700" style="s2">to to kind of move past that without</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.050" end="00:22:44.190" style="s2">starting to argue and he doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.700" end="00:22:46.260" style="s2">think he wants wants to argue but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.190" end="00:22:47.730" style="s2">think that that&#39;s and because it&#39;s Sammy</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.260" end="00:22:49.290" style="s2">was so funny the way he dealt with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.730" end="00:22:51.420" style="s2">in that discussion where Jordan brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:52.740" style="s2">that up and Sam said I&#39;m gonna deal with</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.420" end="00:22:54.900" style="s2">this cuz I&#39;m sick of hearing this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.740" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">argument like I&#39;m sick of hearing it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.900" end="00:22:58.230" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna deal with it once and for all</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:22:59.820" style="s2">then he said something like it&#39;s he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.230" end="00:23:01.470" style="s2">what you would expect no that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.820" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">religion but it&#39;s like I&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.470" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">my buddy I&#39;m not convinced at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:07.770" style="s2">because it was already there in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:09.030" style="s2">French Revolution you know all that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.770" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">already there in the French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.030" end="00:23:12.030" style="s2">in a smaller scale but we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.830" end="00:23:13.800" style="s2">we&#39;re now we&#39;re talking about tens of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.030" end="00:23:15.480" style="s2">thousands and maybe up to a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.800" end="00:23:18.390" style="s2">thousand people that were slaughtered</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.480" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">because of reason like they they clearly</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.390" end="00:23:23.670" style="s2">said that that that the motivating</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:26.100" style="s2">factor behind their action was reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.670" end="00:23:28.170" style="s2">science progress that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.100" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">they said and they even had the cult of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.170" end="00:23:32.250" style="s2">Reason where they they destroyed all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.420" style="s2">the church they would empty out the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.250" end="00:23:36.330" style="s2">churches and they used the church</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.420" end="00:23:37.350" style="s2">building to celebrate reason and so they</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.330" end="00:23:40.860" style="s2">would all get together and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.350" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">reason and and and that happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.860" end="00:23:45.450" style="s2">blood of the peasants like that have</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:48.540" style="s2">been soaking in in in Catholic blood so</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.450" end="00:23:50.190" style="s2">I think that I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.540" end="00:23:52.740" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a it&#39;s a frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.190" end="00:23:53.700" style="s2">thing and I think that&#39;s I also actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.740" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">also think that&#39;s what makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.700" end="00:23:59.040" style="s2">position dangerous is because he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.140" style="s2">that he is innocent he thinks that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.040" end="00:24:03.150" style="s2">innocent and that his position is only</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.140" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">innocent he always says something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.150" end="00:24:08.610" style="s2">atheism just means the belief in no God</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:11.010" style="s2">there is no positive aspect to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.610" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">atheism now we want to propose after</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.010" end="00:24:15.690" style="s2">that let&#39;s leave that aside and we want</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:17.280" style="s2">to propose some positive things and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.690" end="00:24:19.230" style="s2">in the position where he can say well</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.280" end="00:24:21.150" style="s2">what I propose has never been tried it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.230" end="00:24:22.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist and so hi it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.150" end="00:24:25.860" style="s2">beautiful look at how beautiful what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.590" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">proposing is and he doesn&#39;t he can&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.860" end="00:24:29.490" style="s2">can&#39;t underst</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:32.190" style="s2">and the side effects of what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.490" end="00:24:34.350" style="s2">proposing can&#39;t understand how when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.190" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2">do something you cannot you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.350" end="00:24:39.690" style="s2">necessarily know the ramifications on</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">the side and so he complains I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.690" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">about about North American nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:48.900" style="s2">their obsession with their cars and with</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:50.310" style="s2">celebrities but then he somehow sees</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.900" end="00:24:52.860" style="s2">that it is negative but then he wants a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.310" end="00:24:55.650" style="s2">secular society it&#39;s like well maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.860" end="00:24:57.870" style="s2">secular society gives that because</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.650" end="00:24:59.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened and the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.870" end="00:25:04.140" style="s2">alternative to that too like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.910" end="00:25:06.870" style="s2">mall going fat you know diabetes like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.140" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">maybe the only opposite to that is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.870" end="00:25:11.310" style="s2">anchor yourself in something like reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:14.790" style="s2">or nation or something lower on the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.310" end="00:25:17.820" style="s2">hierarchy and then becoming a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.790" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">becoming an ideologue and and then just</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.820" end="00:25:22.170" style="s2">going and destroying churches or you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">know killing whatever group that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.170" end="00:25:26.220" style="s2">going to be killed because he&#39;s not part</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">of your thing so anyways I like I said</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.220" end="00:25:29.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve said this in the describe before I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:31.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think Sam Harris is the one who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:33.180" style="s2">go out and and burn churches obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.080" end="00:25:35.160" style="s2">not it would be more like the FARC type</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.180" end="00:25:37.350" style="s2">you know like Varg would you would take</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.160" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">the atheism to go in and destroy</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.350" end="00:25:41.550" style="s2">churches it wouldn&#39;t be Sam but in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">wake of what he&#39;s proposing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.550" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">those are that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">I like I can&#39;t see anything besides that</p>
