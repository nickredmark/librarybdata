<p begin="00:01:17.479" end="00:01:31.490" style="s2">this polling feature yeah so we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.010" end="00:01:36.050" style="s2">revisit some of the questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.490" end="00:01:39.890" style="s2">populated a couple of weeks ago but what</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.050" end="00:01:46.580" style="s2">I was what I was trying to do is look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.890" end="00:01:51.110" style="s2">them as a whole and I started having the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.580" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">impulse to move on to a series that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.110" end="00:01:59.630" style="s2">could build on around the question of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.060" end="00:02:04.090" style="s2">what is the spirituality we need does</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.630" end="00:02:04.090" style="s2">that seem like it has energy ug for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.930" end="00:02:10.539" style="s2">yeah so what do i what do i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:21.069" style="s2">you know we usually relate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.000" end="00:02:21.069" style="s2">spirituality and religion as</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:27.290" style="s2">technologies that we can ascribe to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">know they&#39;re there they exist for us we</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.290" end="00:02:34.190" style="s2">try to evaluate them</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:36.890" style="s2">pick and choose but all these all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.190" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">spiritualities have evolved in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.890" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">historical timeframe and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.180" end="00:02:50.960" style="s2">what is the historical timeframe asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.490" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">of spirituality asking of us today and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.960" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">think it&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:03:00.170" style="s2">because people often react to that as</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:02.650" style="s2">really you get ya make up a spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.170" end="00:03:04.550" style="s2">right we we have this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.650" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">compartmentalizing like spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.550" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">something that&#39;s like ontological</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:17.620" style="s2">existing for you know and someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">discovered it right but really they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.620" end="00:03:24.670" style="s2">creations of human collectives and their</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">experience in historical moments in time</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.670" end="00:03:30.350" style="s2">so we see this happening I&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:32.510" style="s2">only one that&#39;s bringing up this</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.350" end="00:03:34.670" style="s2">question we see it happening in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.510" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">the religion with that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.670" end="00:03:40.940" style="s2">and JonBenet Keys work and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:45.110" style="s2">other people who are pursuing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.940" end="00:03:47.540" style="s2">question I&#39;m gonna tag it on you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.110" end="00:03:51.350" style="s2">just just to be completely transparent</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:56.209" style="s2">about what is arising and me is I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.350" end="00:03:59.989" style="s2">want to tag it on two couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.209" end="00:04:04.660" style="s2">that&#39;s been happening in the space the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.989" end="00:04:09.769" style="s2">conversation that Jared had with with</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.660" end="00:04:13.690" style="s2">robbery last week around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.769" end="00:04:15.860" style="s2">distinctions between Sutra and Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.690" end="00:04:18.080" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve been having with Tom</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.860" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">Murray and John Churchill who was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.080" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">student of Dan Brown&#39;s conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">with people in the monastic Academy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:29.990" style="s2">the book recent book by Evan Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:32.900" style="s2">why I am NOT a Buddhist and somehow in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.990" end="00:04:37.750" style="s2">my mind these are all percolating in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.900" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">this constellation this movement toward</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.750" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">becoming more intentional about</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.860" end="00:04:49.330" style="s2">this question is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:53.420" style="s2">spirituality we need and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.330" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">catalyze that somehow now of course I</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.420" end="00:05:00.590" style="s2">think this question deserves a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:03.080" style="s2">more time and attention than a one-hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.590" end="00:05:07.250" style="s2">stoah session or maybe we could do three</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.080" end="00:05:13.430" style="s2">or four in a row but this this on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.250" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">other hand I think I think it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:18.230" style="s2">need so much gravitas you know this</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">question doesn&#39;t need to live in an</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.230" end="00:05:27.040" style="s2">institution or or be sequestered in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.000" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">behind the hallowed halls of a monastery</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.040" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">I think that and then another thing I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:35.780" style="s2">was talking to someone the other day</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:41.060" style="s2">about collective insect practice is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:42.980" style="s2">doing an interview and I noticed that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.060" end="00:05:44.690" style="s2">had switched in terms of my whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.980" end="00:05:47.960" style="s2">orientation to that the collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.690" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">insight practice these practices usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.960" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">go over two and a half days on a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:57.260" style="s2">they&#39;re very intensive and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:59.270" style="s2">starting to think think now of all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.260" end="00:06:00.770" style="s2">changes in all the collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.270" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">intelligence we have around these</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.770" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">practices now and I&#39;m starting to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.220" style="s2">that these practice should should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:10.010" style="s2">less like programs and more like apps</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.220" end="00:06:12.020" style="s2">more like one offs more like these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.010" end="00:06:14.390" style="s2">of things in the stoah I mean they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:16.640" style="s2">lead to deeper engagements I think their</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.390" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">needs I think you could you could do a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">lot more with kind of building skills</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">like we&#39;ve been doing here in the star</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:25.580" style="s2">these little bit skill building things</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:28.580" style="s2">so all of this is kind of in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.580" end="00:06:33.950" style="s2">question of the spirituality we meet we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.580" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">need today and I just wanted to outline</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.950" end="00:06:40.090" style="s2">it and then maybe I wanted to do an</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:45.980" style="s2">exercise and the exercise I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.090" end="00:06:49.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve never before so we I want you to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.980" end="00:06:53.540" style="s2">very non-judgmental about it and what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.220" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">mean by that is not have any framework</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.540" end="00:06:58.540" style="s2">like what&#39;s the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">or I did the wrong thing or I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.540" end="00:07:03.070" style="s2">discover something that&#39;s in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:07.690" style="s2">direction this is not an exercise that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.070" end="00:07:09.610" style="s2">has that kind of pointing out you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.690" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">like I know what I&#39;m pointing out kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.610" end="00:07:22.210" style="s2">of thing so so that&#39;s what what we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:25.660" style="s2">today so first of all we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.210" end="00:07:36.070" style="s2">working definition of spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.660" end="00:07:39.700" style="s2">one that is quite robust and so I like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.070" end="00:07:42.550" style="s2">this out in a video on integral stage so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.700" end="00:07:44.590" style="s2">if you want to see the whole thing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.550" end="00:07:47.230" style="s2">can it&#39;s a short pretty short video but</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:49.480" style="s2">what I mean by spirituality is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.230" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">commitments and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.480" end="00:07:57.730" style="s2">commitments are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:08:00.130" style="s2">conscious all the time okay so this the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.730" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">set of commitments are ontological so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.130" end="00:08:05.950" style="s2">what is the world like what what do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:10.060" style="s2">commit to what we believe about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.950" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">world they are epistemological what do</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.060" end="00:08:16.870" style="s2">we what do we what is our ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:19.270" style="s2">understanding of how we know things how</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.870" end="00:08:21.790" style="s2">are we going to relate to that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.270" end="00:08:25.270" style="s2">axia logical which is means morals and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.790" end="00:08:29.740" style="s2">ethics and their metaphysical so you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.270" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">take any spirituality and you can do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.740" end="00:08:36.400" style="s2">know identify it by these commitments of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.710" style="s2">the foundational commitments that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.400" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">make and so these questions then become</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.710" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">what are the commitments we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:52.600" style="s2">in these four areas for the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">we need now just to give you give you a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.600" end="00:08:57.070" style="s2">little how I answer some of that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:08:59.980" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do the exercise so an</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:04.410" style="s2">ontological commitment for example is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:07.650" style="s2">is the world really real so Bhaskar said</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.410" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">that we should commit to ontological</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.650" end="00:09:12.130" style="s2">realism which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.190" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">naive realism naive realism is you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.130" end="00:09:15.190" style="s2">what you think about the world is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:18.460" style="s2">way the world is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.190" end="00:09:21.960" style="s2">but ontological realism means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.460" end="00:09:25.990" style="s2">something about the world that exists</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:43.150" style="s2">gives a sense that the you know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.950" end="00:10:10.630" style="s2">original sinning and go to heaven so</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:14.020" style="s2">these are all ontological commitments</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.630" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">like what is what is this world and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.020" end="00:10:19.090" style="s2">think that in for the spirituality we</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">need today we need ontological a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.090" end="00:10:28.150" style="s2">commitment to ontological realism</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:30.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s the only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:35.890" style="s2">commitment I believe that will ground us</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.970" end="00:10:39.490" style="s2">in protecting the earth if we are subtly</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.890" end="00:10:42.610" style="s2">holding that it&#39;s not real then this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.490" end="00:10:45.940" style="s2">not where our intention will go so again</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.610" end="00:10:48.990" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying this is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.940" end="00:10:52.030" style="s2">ontological commitment for all time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.990" end="00:10:54.070" style="s2">saying that we can fashion the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.030" end="00:10:56.440" style="s2">spirituality we need around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.070" end="00:11:03.190" style="s2">ontological commitment that we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.440" end="00:11:04.839" style="s2">need today so just just hold that very I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.190" end="00:11:06.700" style="s2">mean I&#39;m very serious about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.839" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">commitment but I&#39;m also serious about</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.700" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">the choice for that commitment and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:16.420" style="s2">other ontological commitments arise in</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">other historical contexts and holding</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.420" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">what I just said means I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:22.660" style="s2">committed to epistemic relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:25.690" style="s2">these two right</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:27.449" style="s2">I wrote a lot about how they actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.690" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">serve each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.449" end="00:11:32.350" style="s2">that if you just have epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:35.500" style="s2">relativism there&#39;s all kinds of problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.350" end="00:11:40.329" style="s2">if you only have ontological realism you</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.500" end="00:11:42.490" style="s2">have you know fights over your reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.329" end="00:11:45.459" style="s2">but if you can hold these two together</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.490" end="00:11:50.620" style="s2">they they serve each other an epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.459" end="00:11:54.490" style="s2">real epistemic relativism is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.620" end="00:11:57.189" style="s2">commitment to not only the partiality of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.490" end="00:11:59.500" style="s2">what we can know right so we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.189" end="00:12:02.019" style="s2">committed that what we know is partial</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.500" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">truth so that that&#39;s been stated</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.019" end="00:12:07.540" style="s2">elsewhere by Wilbur let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.410" end="00:12:14.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a back end to that and that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.540" end="00:12:17.470" style="s2">that all partial truths are wholly valid</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.019" end="00:12:19.569" style="s2">in their context so they&#39;re not just so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.470" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">they&#39;re partial truths and we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.569" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">then think of well they&#39;re not not very</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:26.439" style="s2">valid because they&#39;re partial so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:29.649" style="s2">have to hold these two commitments I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.439" end="00:12:32.920" style="s2">think an epistemic relativism at once</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.649" end="00:12:36.939" style="s2">that all truths are partial but there</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.920" end="00:12:40.980" style="s2">are 100% true in their context which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.939" end="00:12:43.990" style="s2">just a piece and this makes us much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.980" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">compassionate with people who are from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.990" end="00:12:47.889" style="s2">certain context and they&#39;re just telling</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:48.699" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking their truth and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.889" end="00:12:50.589" style="s2">like ah let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.699" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">that&#39;s true but partial you see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.589" end="00:12:55.149" style="s2">difference I&#39;m trying to make a point</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:58.839" style="s2">here about what epistemic relativism</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.149" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">means it&#39;s not just oh yes but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.839" end="00:13:05.889" style="s2">partial when we say that we say it from</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:08.290" style="s2">vantage point as if we can tell it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.889" end="00:13:10.809" style="s2">partial because we have a higher truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.290" end="00:13:12.939" style="s2">we have more of the truth right this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.809" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">this is the way people have been using</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.939" end="00:13:21.129" style="s2">that phrase forever</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:24.610" style="s2">so one of the things you can do in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.129" end="00:13:27.939" style="s2">spirituality is to investigate this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.610" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">this is a whole truth arising in front</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.939" end="00:13:36.130" style="s2">of me how can I see the context more</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">clearly and then come from that context</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">to help or to support or to you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.040" end="00:13:47.410" style="s2">whatever participate so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.580" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">an important kind of refrain for</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.410" end="00:13:54.600" style="s2">epistemic relativism is not as trivial</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:57.220" style="s2">as a lot of people have taken that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.600" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">statement in the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.220" end="00:14:12.900" style="s2">so the third one Axia logical means</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:19.030" style="s2">ethics and that ethics and morals and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.900" end="00:14:23.890" style="s2">Bosch car had this notion of what he</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.030" end="00:14:26.740" style="s2">called judgmental rationalism that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.890" end="00:14:32.200" style="s2">should use judgmental rationalism to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.740" end="00:14:35.610" style="s2">evaluate morals and ethics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.200" end="00:14:37.570" style="s2">that we need to push that further I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:39.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s you know a good starting</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.570" end="00:14:41.170" style="s2">point but for me the spirituality we</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.400" end="00:14:43.900" style="s2">need is something a little different</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.170" end="00:14:46.990" style="s2">than that and so I want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.900" end="00:14:50.950" style="s2">instead of judgment because judgment has</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.990" end="00:14:54.310" style="s2">this hard cut to it I want to turn the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.950" end="00:14:58.810" style="s2">word into evaluative so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.310" end="00:15:02.050" style="s2">evaluating across a spectrum of values</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.810" end="00:15:05.020" style="s2">or such different than judgment and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.050" end="00:15:08.200" style="s2">I mean is the distinction can&#39;t made</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.020" end="00:15:11.020" style="s2">between rational judgment and aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.200" end="00:15:14.500" style="s2">judgment so when we look at beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.020" end="00:15:17.380" style="s2">artwork our eyes are moving and we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.500" end="00:15:22.090" style="s2">feel that we&#39;re making some kind of vat</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.380" end="00:15:24.130" style="s2">of value evaluating experience you like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.090" end="00:15:25.870" style="s2">this yellow and then you&#39;re moving but</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.130" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not a judgment unless you&#39;re an art</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.870" end="00:15:34.090" style="s2">critic right so aesthetic judgment</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:37.750" style="s2">I&#39;m calling evaluative and the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.090" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">to be evaluative now instead of so he -</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.750" end="00:15:43.930" style="s2">Kari called it judgmental rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">and I think rational is also we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.930" end="00:15:50.010" style="s2">push beyond rationalism it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:52.740" style="s2">categorical and I think we can push the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.010" end="00:15:57.330" style="s2">into this notion of reasonableness so an</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.740" end="00:16:01.950" style="s2">axiology of evaluative reasonableness</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.330" end="00:16:05.790" style="s2">and the word reasonable really evokes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.950" end="00:16:09.480" style="s2">whole different stance toward judgment</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.790" end="00:16:13.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say or evaluation because I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.480" end="00:16:16.230" style="s2">for example I this is I use this I use</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.590" end="00:16:21.720" style="s2">this example the other day it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.230" end="00:16:24.150" style="s2">it was a little bit trigger for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.720" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">people are talking to so I just gave you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.150" end="00:16:27.180" style="s2">a trigger warning you see how I put a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:33.630" style="s2">trigger warning in there without saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.180" end="00:16:37.830" style="s2">good morning okay so for example there</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.630" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">have been something like a 500% increase</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.830" end="00:16:47.430" style="s2">in gun purchases in the US since COBIT</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">right so I can actually I can see the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.430" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">reasonableness of wanting to go out in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:56.220" style="s2">the climate of the US and get a gun like</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:57.660" style="s2">I can really lean into that I can lean</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.220" end="00:16:58.290" style="s2">into it I actually thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.660" end="00:17:01.740" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.290" end="00:17:03.900" style="s2">you know so but I can evaluate it as</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.740" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">less less or more reasonable than</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">something else but I can enter the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:11.250" style="s2">context in which it&#39;s reasonable and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:13.770" style="s2">truth is it&#39;s not rational to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:15.690" style="s2">get a gun to protect you from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.770" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">government let&#39;s say it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.690" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">irrational your gun is not gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:25.230" style="s2">know no match for the military but I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">understand the reasonableness of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.230" end="00:17:31.110" style="s2">certain context and then I can evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.780" end="00:17:35.730" style="s2">that across other reasonableness right</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.110" end="00:17:38.220" style="s2">so we can turn we can move from trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.730" end="00:17:41.070" style="s2">to evaluate and judge rationally you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:43.560" style="s2">can&#39;t evaluate and judge for example the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:45.540" style="s2">information ecology around coal bed but</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.560" end="00:17:48.030" style="s2">you can do something about valuation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.540" end="00:17:51.150" style="s2">the reasonableness of certain of certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.030" end="00:17:53.300" style="s2">choices let&#39;s say so it kind of is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.150" end="00:18:00.390" style="s2">posture that I think creates a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.300" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">affordances a lot more you know I have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.390" end="00:18:05.880" style="s2">have it examined this work it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">from from a critical stance I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.880" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">kind of in the honeymoon period so but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:16.230" style="s2">think that shift from rush judgemental</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:18.270" style="s2">rationalism to evaluative reasonableness</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.230" end="00:18:25.610" style="s2">is part of our commitment to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.270" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">spirituality we need okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.610" end="00:18:32.010" style="s2">so so this is kind of like I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:35.160" style="s2">showing you the kind of methodology that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.010" end="00:18:40.770" style="s2">a community could sit in and start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.160" end="00:18:43.470" style="s2">have start to co-create this you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.770" end="00:18:49.110" style="s2">this the spirituality we need it around</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.470" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2">these kind of bones now those are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.110" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">easy the last one our metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">commitments and this is what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">to do this untried exercise and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:08.490" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll talk about the exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.210" end="00:19:12.230" style="s2">then I&#39;ll get into where this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.490" end="00:19:15.210" style="s2">spirituality we need goes in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.230" end="00:19:28.200" style="s2">metaphysical commitments instead this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.210" end="00:19:30.690" style="s2">one is this was quite complex so just</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.200" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">for a moment you know just you know take</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.690" end="00:19:39.830" style="s2">a meditation posture or just relax we</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">are gonna go this this is the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.830" end="00:19:48.420" style="s2">level of meditation ever that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:51.000" style="s2">need for this exercise and that is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.420" end="00:19:53.400" style="s2">to pay attention to your thoughts let</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.000" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">your thoughts come and pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.400" end="00:20:00.150" style="s2">your thoughts or pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:04.280" style="s2">whatever is arising and if it&#39;s Lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.150" end="00:20:08.100" style="s2">that&#39;s good because we just want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.280" end="00:20:10.200" style="s2">experience what what our attention what</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.100" end="00:20:13.110" style="s2">is the capacity of attention what is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.200" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">quality of attending to inner experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.110" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">so it could be any inner experience in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">this case</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.740" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">yeah so if you have attention with</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.930" end="00:20:33.100" style="s2">somebody said to have little attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:37.140" style="s2">deficit disorder but you can still</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.100" end="00:20:40.030" style="s2">experience your attention as being a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.140" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">frenetic or frantic or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.030" end="00:20:45.250" style="s2">experience is that yes this is how my</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">attention works we just want to get in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.250" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">touch with what we call what we call</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">attention just that that word</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.900" end="00:21:12.590" style="s2">and as you&#39;re doing that you can put in</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.059" end="00:21:16.040" style="s2">the chat room what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.590" end="00:21:20.180" style="s2">qualities or how how do you recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.040" end="00:21:23.870" style="s2">as a tension so for example I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.180" end="00:21:29.290" style="s2">that it skips I can go here I can go</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.870" end="00:21:29.290" style="s2">there it has has that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.350" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">get foregrounds good these are all</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.530" end="00:21:51.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what we say but by by</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:53.570" style="s2">using a word we know we&#39;ll know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.020" end="00:21:58.990" style="s2">that attentional system is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.570" end="00:21:58.990" style="s2">we&#39;re in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.690" end="00:22:24.230" style="s2">these are all great great noticin ah</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.330" end="00:22:24.230" style="s2">that&#39;s great that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:41.540" style="s2">yeahmaybe great that&#39;s I would say for</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.470" end="00:22:45.920" style="s2">makings realize eight what does he call</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.540" end="00:22:48.920" style="s2">realization salience is the attentional</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.920" end="00:22:51.680" style="s2">system for him you know I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.920" end="00:23:05.800" style="s2">to bracket what we call the attentional</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.680" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">system relevance realization thank you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.800" end="00:23:21.980" style="s2">that would be his you&#39;re his word the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:27.470" style="s2">attention system brackets right okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.980" end="00:23:29.930" style="s2">good now so that was um the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.470" end="00:23:32.540" style="s2">that is I don&#39;t I&#39;m not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.930" end="00:23:34.430" style="s2">the attention system right so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:37.430" style="s2">purpose of getting in touch with it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.430" end="00:23:39.350" style="s2">because that&#39;s not what this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.430" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">I&#39;m going to ask you to do that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.350" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">where I want you to go okay does that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">so now that you know okay you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:55.990" style="s2">this that that I&#39;m not the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:55.990" style="s2">this and we&#39;re not interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:24:03.250" style="s2">and now we&#39;re gonna spend ten minutes I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.810" end="00:24:03.250" style="s2">want you to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.590" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">where is your will</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.680" end="00:24:39.020" style="s2">and get in touch with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.380" end="00:26:12.919" style="s2">now notice I&#39;m not asking you to pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:12.919" style="s2">attention to your will</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.800" end="00:26:34.900" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s something like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.990" end="00:26:37.180" style="s2">nice distinction that what like you feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.900" end="00:26:40.300" style="s2">the difference when you when I said that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.180" end="00:26:43.050" style="s2">this sense of not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.300" end="00:26:43.050" style="s2">your will</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.049" end="00:28:25.110" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.380" end="00:28:59.020" style="s2">okay let&#39;s um see if anybody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.060" end="00:29:04.750" style="s2">share some of this experience and very</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.020" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">curious to see how you would language or</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.750" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">speak from this experience as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.060" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually done that this before</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:37.110" style="s2">this feels a lot like my meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.770" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:48.040" style="s2">Eckhart Tolle which is a renunciation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:50.980" style="s2">thought presence and can be very like my</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.040" end="00:29:53.860" style="s2">inner dialogue has just been cleaning me</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.980" end="00:29:56.020" style="s2">so this presence practice is skidding</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.860" end="00:30:00.700" style="s2">into my body and there&#39;s that stillness</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.020" end="00:30:02.350" style="s2">there detachment so when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.700" end="00:30:04.150" style="s2">at like where is my attention it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.350" end="00:30:06.490" style="s2">like ping ping ping ping and I like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.150" end="00:30:09.970" style="s2">could really direct it and then my will</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.490" end="00:30:11.980" style="s2">just felt like an energy field coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.970" end="00:30:14.910" style="s2">through my body but much outside of my</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.980" end="00:30:19.030" style="s2">body and I can thanks to this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.910" end="00:30:21.610" style="s2">practice I can excuse myself from</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.030" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2">thought pretty easily how long I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.610" end="00:30:28.120" style="s2">stay there is something I&#39;m growing so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.630" end="00:30:30.400" style="s2">when you said where&#39;s your will I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">switched to the stillness and just sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.400" end="00:30:42.250" style="s2">of undulated there yes yeah I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.140" end="00:30:45.940" style="s2">sure if the word will was gonna work but</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.250" end="00:30:50.920" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want something that preloaded</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.940" end="00:30:54.420" style="s2">your experience either so that was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.920" end="00:30:54.420" style="s2">was great feedback thank you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.280" end="00:31:06.780" style="s2">in my experience I was noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.200" end="00:31:10.680" style="s2">like where is is your will</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.780" end="00:31:15.780" style="s2">was that the question yeah or you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.680" end="00:31:21.000" style="s2">it was hard to the prompt was hard to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.780" end="00:31:23.250" style="s2">figure out but yeah where is well I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.000" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">looking for my will or trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.250" end="00:31:28.140" style="s2">that in my experience and then I found</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:35.280" style="s2">that very like act of looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.140" end="00:31:38.610" style="s2">that felt like my will to me ah but then</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.280" end="00:31:41.670" style="s2">you said it was in your gut yes right</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.610" end="00:31:46.650" style="s2">and so when you were with it in your gut</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.670" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">and you stopped looking that what was</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.650" end="00:31:58.530" style="s2">that like see to look for your well is</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:32:01.140" style="s2">to is to is pay attention to it this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.530" end="00:32:05.490" style="s2">what I I would say so the the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.140" end="00:32:07.410" style="s2">is one then he was odds and my god then</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.490" end="00:32:10.350" style="s2">so you stop looking and what was what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.410" end="00:32:15.110" style="s2">was that like yeah that was like my just</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.350" end="00:32:19.770" style="s2">initial response to to your prompt and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.110" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">it just feels like a lot of energy like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.770" end="00:32:23.940" style="s2">that would be like the easiest way to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:26.360" style="s2">describe it without getting too</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.940" end="00:32:29.820" style="s2">technical about it just feels like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.360" end="00:32:31.260" style="s2">churning or this wanting to be directed</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.820" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">somewhere feels a little uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.260" end="00:32:37.410" style="s2">actually yeah yeah so I you know rainy</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:40.170" style="s2">is saying this you had the prompt where</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.410" end="00:32:42.900" style="s2">is it actually engaged or attentional</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.170" end="00:32:46.290" style="s2">system and then remember later I had to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.900" end="00:32:49.770" style="s2">kind of try to reframe don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.290" end="00:32:52.950" style="s2">attend to it so I think that prompt the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.770" end="00:32:56.790" style="s2">prompt was not perfect so where is your</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.950" end="00:32:59.610" style="s2">will or I could have said get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.790" end="00:33:01.710" style="s2">with your will or something it needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.610" end="00:33:04.920" style="s2">some improving but yeah it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.710" end="00:33:07.370" style="s2">energy and it feels uncomfortable that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.920" end="00:33:11.750" style="s2">that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.370" end="00:33:16.670" style="s2">ah that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting that I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.750" end="00:33:19.460" style="s2">resonate with that what&#39;s uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.670" end="00:33:28.400" style="s2">about it like what&#39;s the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.460" end="00:33:29.900" style="s2">discomfort like intensity intensity when</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.400" end="00:33:34.670" style="s2">I&#39;m when I&#39;m with it it just feels like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.900" end="00:33:37.250" style="s2">a lot and that I want to point it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.670" end="00:33:41.530" style="s2">express it and do something with it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.250" end="00:33:49.310" style="s2">it feels like yeah it&#39;s a quite an</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.530" end="00:33:54.110" style="s2">interpretation to say with yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.310" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">noticed just even just now that I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.110" end="00:34:00.890" style="s2">been eating and I feel like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:03.350" style="s2">what is bonita talking about when she</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.890" end="00:34:06.500" style="s2">says will because there&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.350" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">impulses and then there&#39;s like oh now</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">I&#39;m being watched so I started like</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:16.550" style="s2">noticing impulses with my to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">impulses and that is that my will or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.550" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">being original impre impulses like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.900" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">yeah feels like it&#39;s coming from a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">of different places</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a metaphor you use like an image or</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.870" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">something but feels like there&#39;s control</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.490" end="00:35:22.050" style="s2">a tiger came up ah there&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.070" end="00:35:25.830" style="s2">this fierce energy like yeah we need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.050" end="00:35:39.180" style="s2">have an energy like like I felt this</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.830" end="00:35:42.680" style="s2">sense of animal especially my eyes you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.180" end="00:35:42.680" style="s2">two I can enjoy your day</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.100" end="00:36:04.370" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the inquiry that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.150" end="00:36:09.320" style="s2">initially brought to mind all of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.370" end="00:36:13.940" style="s2">wants things that I want and what and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.320" end="00:36:16.910" style="s2">then it immediately went to this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.940" end="00:36:21.740" style="s2">will that is that doesn&#39;t originate in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.910" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">me it feels more like a life drive like</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.740" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">a like a drive that&#39;s sort of living</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:37.850" style="s2">through me and just it&#39;s really curious</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:46.670" style="s2">how I don&#39;t I don&#39;t identify it as my</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.850" end="00:36:49.100" style="s2">own but yet it is in me and no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.670" end="00:36:52.010" style="s2">beautiful this is you&#39;re channeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.100" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">Schopenhauer he said I can well what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.010" end="00:36:59.240" style="s2">want but I can&#39;t will that I will it</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:06.850" style="s2">comes through me and this is I think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.240" end="00:37:08.840" style="s2">intensity and the Tiger nurse of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.850" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">continuous with the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.840" end="00:37:14.450" style="s2">universe Hey and when you touch base</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:19.330" style="s2">with that that&#39;s that that intensity</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.450" end="00:37:27.100" style="s2">that or it&#39;s not me and it&#39;s intense or</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.330" end="00:37:27.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not sourced by me yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.550" end="00:37:40.550" style="s2">I had this kind of I guess that imagery</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.370" end="00:37:42.770" style="s2">became available I my attention was my</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.550" end="00:37:46.450" style="s2">thoughts were like these like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.770" end="00:37:49.670" style="s2">bubbles or I would expand a contract and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.450" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">it fell me I&#39;ll scream like will was</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.670" end="00:37:55.250" style="s2">like at the edges of space in-between</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:56.900" style="s2">and kind of could pusher or contract</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.250" end="00:37:58.550" style="s2">away and but there was all these</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.900" end="00:38:01.580" style="s2">different bubbles so it was in the space</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.550" end="00:38:03.980" style="s2">between why it wasn&#39;t a thing itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.580" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">and in the same way that these bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.980" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">of thought like the attention ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.170" end="00:38:31.269" style="s2">and I felt similar to a few of the last</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.450" end="00:38:32.890" style="s2">years the the first one I didn&#39;t take as</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.269" end="00:38:35.319" style="s2">much as attention as the inner</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.890" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">experience so I kind of landed in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.319" end="00:38:42.220" style="s2">space of stillness and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:44.470" style="s2">first asked where&#39;s will there was there</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.220" end="00:38:47.230" style="s2">was a kind of an empty just a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:49.750" style="s2">awareness so it&#39;s like really whoa where</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.230" end="00:38:51.549" style="s2">is it where to go there no well then</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.750" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of feeling of like an</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.549" end="00:38:56.680" style="s2">embodied feeling of the Hara like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:58.359" style="s2">really moving towards something and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.680" end="00:38:59.559" style="s2">I kind of wasn&#39;t satisfied with that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.359" end="00:39:01.569" style="s2">just stayed with that for a bit and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.559" end="00:39:04.119" style="s2">I I started like you know thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.569" end="00:39:06.220" style="s2">how I you know some work I have to do or</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.119" end="00:39:09.670" style="s2">some problem I have with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.220" end="00:39:13.569" style="s2">that I could kind of see the whole will</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.670" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">- I like what people said about once and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.569" end="00:39:17.019" style="s2">goals like I kind of generated a want</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:19.059" style="s2">and then I was solving it I was like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.019" end="00:39:21.190" style="s2">problem-solving mode and then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.059" end="00:39:22.329" style="s2">activities came up there kind of maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.190" end="00:39:23.890" style="s2">little bit like video was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.329" end="00:39:26.260" style="s2">those thought clouds or something they</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.890" end="00:39:27.519" style="s2">were gonna go and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.260" end="00:39:29.789" style="s2">extinguish and they&#39;d be back in</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.519" end="00:39:29.789" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.089" end="00:39:44.930" style="s2">for me the the experience was very</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.039" end="00:39:46.789" style="s2">different from what I anticipated I</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.930" end="00:39:49.220" style="s2">thought I would feel it in my gut but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.789" end="00:39:54.009" style="s2">really felt most of it around my neck</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.220" end="00:39:58.099" style="s2">and my upper shoulders faced and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.009" end="00:40:01.579" style="s2">metaphorically it was almost as if there</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.099" end="00:40:04.099" style="s2">was possible extensions octopus-like</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.579" end="00:40:06.559" style="s2">perhaps or multiple hands and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.099" end="00:40:08.599" style="s2">possibilities of doing things as almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.559" end="00:40:16.069" style="s2">the two hands were not enough and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.599" end="00:40:18.769" style="s2">were other ways moving around moving and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.069" end="00:40:22.119" style="s2">sort of having this multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.769" end="00:40:22.119" style="s2">perspective on things</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.230" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">yeah for me that&#39;s very interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:41:05.859" style="s2">for me if I if I ask the question an</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:08.380" style="s2">open-ended way I experience it more like</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.859" end="00:41:11.589" style="s2">Donna and other people were talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.380" end="00:41:13.690" style="s2">about that it drops me you know I feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.589" end="00:41:18.550" style="s2">weighty it drops me into my lower</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.690" end="00:41:22.810" style="s2">chakras it feels like if I could have</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.550" end="00:41:24.550" style="s2">the capacity to open the whole force of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.810" end="00:41:29.349" style="s2">the universe could express itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.550" end="00:41:32.410" style="s2">through me this intensity builds but</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.349" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">what you just described I&#39;m also aware</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.410" end="00:41:39.790" style="s2">of and that is this sense of very</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">directed will I mean I have there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.790" end="00:41:44.589" style="s2">times when I&#39;ve taken that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:47.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve stared down like which is like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.589" end="00:41:50.200" style="s2">have a perceptual experience of a vortex</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.410" end="00:41:53.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s like that energies come up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.200" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like a steel blade and it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.230" end="00:42:02.050" style="s2">when it comes from for me like from here</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:04.510" style="s2">you know this posture you would say so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.050" end="00:42:06.700" style="s2">would say yes that that&#39;s in the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.510" end="00:42:12.040" style="s2">domain it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.700" end="00:42:13.540" style="s2">brought it up is different quality now I</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.040" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s how you experienced</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.540" end="00:42:22.510" style="s2">it but I was trying to remember what</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">what that feels like when that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.510" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">powers in this area yes since you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:32.740" style="s2">mentioned the steel blade like if I had</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:36.339" style="s2">to use a martial arts metaphor it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.740" end="00:42:40.839" style="s2">almost as if one had like potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.339" end="00:42:42.579" style="s2">like Japanese words and then and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.839" end="00:42:45.130" style="s2">ability to maneuver them was not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.579" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">linear though it was multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.130" end="00:42:48.730" style="s2">it was hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.140" end="00:42:50.890" style="s2">I mean even my hands are moving in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.730" end="00:42:52.990" style="s2">manner right now so it&#39;s almost as if</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.890" end="00:42:55.180" style="s2">the hand was not the constraint violence</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.990" end="00:42:59.849" style="s2">war and it was free enough that one</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.180" end="00:42:59.849" style="s2">could cover the entire 360 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.730" end="00:43:25.880" style="s2">anything else</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.310" end="00:43:45.050" style="s2">so that was very helpful thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.490" end="00:43:50.370" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.050" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">so now you tell a story that is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.370" end="00:43:56.510" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:44:04.890" style="s2">horribly bastardized narrative about</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.510" end="00:44:07.470" style="s2">Buddhist metaphysics so yeah I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.890" end="00:44:10.230" style="s2">pathologist but just to give it some</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.470" end="00:44:15.030" style="s2">kind of sense of the spirituality we</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.230" end="00:44:17.970" style="s2">need and put it in a context so you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.030" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">when so again believe me this is a story</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.970" end="00:44:27.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a story a parable take it more as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:29.670" style="s2">metaphor but you know if we can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.870" end="00:44:36.300" style="s2">the Buddha grew up he grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.670" end="00:44:40.190" style="s2">mythological culture and what he</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.300" end="00:44:46.620" style="s2">discovered was with something very very</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.190" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">ingenious and he discovered that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.620" end="00:44:53.010" style="s2">there was causal links between different</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.680" end="00:44:55.080" style="s2">ways that you could react to phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.010" end="00:44:58.950" style="s2">of situations that created suffering</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.080" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">right he basically came up with if-then</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.950" end="00:45:04.830" style="s2">thinking in in the cycle of suffering so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">instead of just I&#39;m destined to be a</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.980" end="00:45:41.610" style="s2">the chain of causality so we see</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.860" end="00:45:44.490" style="s2">actually this notion of the causality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.610" end="00:45:46.830" style="s2">human experience actually arising for</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.490" end="00:45:49.470" style="s2">the first time and you see causality</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.830" end="00:45:54.990" style="s2">also if they&#39;re thinking coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.470" end="00:45:57.780" style="s2">in the Western world with Plato and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.990" end="00:46:00.390" style="s2">know this is sculpturing in the mental</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.780" end="00:46:02.490" style="s2">structure of consciousness so that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.390" end="00:46:05.550" style="s2">that was very interesting and then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.490" end="00:46:10.950" style="s2">could say that the next event or the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.550" end="00:46:15.870" style="s2">second turning was around Nagarjuna&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.950" end="00:46:21.990" style="s2">time and what they discovered then in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.870" end="00:46:25.830" style="s2">terms of causality is that mental models</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.990" end="00:46:28.950" style="s2">and words and concepts even though they</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.830" end="00:46:31.470" style="s2">were virtual an illusionary they had</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.950" end="00:46:36.810" style="s2">real causal effects in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.470" end="00:46:39.360" style="s2">so I could be a paranoid don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.810" end="00:46:41.940" style="s2">delusional a paranoid that you&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.940" end="00:46:47.550" style="s2">illusion right there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.060" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">not real it&#39;s a real illusion but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.440" end="00:46:57.840" style="s2">gun and kill you and that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.510" end="00:47:01.490" style="s2">effect of the world so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.840" end="00:47:04.610" style="s2">that cause of causality that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.490" end="00:47:07.170" style="s2">illusions in your mind or virtual</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.610" end="00:47:11.720" style="s2">experiences could have real causal</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.170" end="00:47:16.980" style="s2">implications in the real world was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.720" end="00:47:19.080" style="s2">major another major mile post and so in</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.980" end="00:47:22.530" style="s2">the human in human consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.080" end="00:47:24.570" style="s2">this created then most of the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.530" end="00:47:27.120" style="s2">that spend all our time with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.570" end="00:47:29.340" style="s2">attentional system right so the constant</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.120" end="00:47:34.050" style="s2">okay we spend all our time with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.340" end="00:47:37.830" style="s2">attentional system and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.050" end="00:47:39.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of benefit for that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.830" end="00:47:42.360" style="s2">one of the problems with starting with</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.780" end="00:47:45.600" style="s2">the attentional system is that you start</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.360" end="00:47:53.550" style="s2">with phenomenon that are already objects</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.600" end="00:47:58.020" style="s2">in your mind and that has some benefits</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.550" end="00:48:00.120" style="s2">and some limitations so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.020" end="00:48:02.850" style="s2">spirituality we need has to work with</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.120" end="00:48:06.600" style="s2">the intentional system</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.850" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">and we need a metaphysics of experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.600" end="00:48:14.520" style="s2">that starts with well an intention but</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:17.370" style="s2">with those practices be like now I know</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.520" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">that this parallels some of contra but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.370" end="00:48:26.970" style="s2">think most of most of that work is whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:33.300" style="s2">is horribly saturated with with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.970" end="00:48:39.480" style="s2">attentional system also so this is part</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.300" end="00:48:42.420" style="s2">of my way of getting into moving from</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.480" end="00:48:44.460" style="s2">the metaphysics of the phenomenon the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.420" end="00:48:47.370" style="s2">phenomenal objects that are already</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.460" end="00:48:49.470" style="s2">objects in your mind so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.370" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">funny see that injunction says let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.470" end="00:48:52.740" style="s2">start with objects in your mind let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:54.300" style="s2">pursue them to the end you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.740" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">they&#39;re empty of course empty because</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.300" end="00:49:00.090" style="s2">you started with objects in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:01.980" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a tautology</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.090" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">you know let&#39;s start with something and</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.980" end="00:49:07.980" style="s2">this is this was hard Shawn&#39;s critique</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:11.460" style="s2">of nourished in our Gardena basically in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.980" end="00:49:13.560" style="s2">a nutshell and so the question is we</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.460" end="00:49:18.030" style="s2">need a metaphysics of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.560" end="00:49:21.600" style="s2">starts with intention the intentional</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.030" end="00:49:24.030" style="s2">system because it two traces back into</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.600" end="00:49:27.750" style="s2">the natural real world as some of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.030" end="00:49:31.020" style="s2">said like a tiger you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.750" end="00:49:33.750" style="s2">see in the tiger a phenomenon arising in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.020" end="00:49:36.690" style="s2">the Tigers mind objects in the Tigers</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.750" end="00:49:38.460" style="s2">mind so you if you create your</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.690" end="00:49:41.970" style="s2">spirituality around that then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.460" end="00:49:44.070" style="s2">feel separate but if you create your</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.970" end="00:49:46.620" style="s2">spirituality around intention and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.070" end="00:49:50.220" style="s2">you&#39;ll see somebody&#39;s notice the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.620" end="00:49:52.920" style="s2">birdsong the swallows fledged this</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.220" end="00:49:54.330" style="s2">morning and the little birds like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.920" end="00:49:56.700" style="s2">is the first time they&#39;re flying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.330" end="00:50:04.050" style="s2">five tiny little swallows and they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.700" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">ecstatic so I can see that in me and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.050" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">can see me and them I&#39;m not gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:14.990" style="s2">know I don&#39;t have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:14.990" style="s2">separation so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.170" end="00:50:20.849" style="s2">I would argue that that&#39;s a move toward</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.869" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">the spiritual the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.849" end="00:50:28.730" style="s2">experience for the spirituality we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">today now when Nagarjuna in his tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:36.270" style="s2">discovered this this this that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:38.309" style="s2">mental you know mental objects were</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.270" end="00:50:41.569" style="s2">causally implicated in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.309" end="00:50:44.790" style="s2">this is something that is a huge benefit</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.569" end="00:50:48.349" style="s2">but I think it stops short of what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.790" end="00:50:48.349" style="s2">what we need today</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.140" end="00:51:30.590" style="s2">and I think that tags back to Peters</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.780" end="00:51:38.070" style="s2">question you know what is what is how</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.590" end="00:51:41.340" style="s2">how how can I be strong enough to lead a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.070" end="00:51:43.260" style="s2">fulfilled life and this notion of strong</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.340" end="00:51:52.440" style="s2">and fulfillment I think it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.260" end="00:51:55.260" style="s2">intentional system any comments I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.440" end="00:51:59.270" style="s2">have a lot to say about it because this</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.260" end="00:52:08.460" style="s2">is something I&#39;m just starting to work</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.270" end="00:52:11.010" style="s2">work on I like to say something I just</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.460" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">think like like in some ways this feels</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.010" end="00:52:20.130" style="s2">to me like some of the things we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">already had in this course was more</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.130" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">profound than this division at least I</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:28.290" style="s2">got some things we have had I cannot see</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:30.930" style="s2">fit into this and in particularly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.290" end="00:52:33.570" style="s2">thinking about the story part because</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.930" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">for me I think that a story is like both</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.570" end="00:52:39.180" style="s2">on tone at the end</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">immersed under the Sun tavini and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.180" end="00:52:44.790" style="s2">benefit six and actually all four of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:47.970" style="s2">them so for me as like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.790" end="00:52:50.580" style="s2">understanding true stories so for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.970" end="00:52:54.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like a basic category that cannot</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.580" end="00:52:57.360" style="s2">be put into one of those four yeah so if</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.780" end="00:53:00.930" style="s2">you can speak to her to that no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.360" end="00:53:05.400" style="s2">actually end up where my my my paper</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.930" end="00:53:09.030" style="s2">ended up whatever in so far is that if</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.400" end="00:53:11.580" style="s2">you have these set of commitments then</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.030" end="00:53:16.710" style="s2">there&#39;s many many many stories that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.580" end="00:53:18.840" style="s2">reflect them so this allows us then to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.710" end="00:53:20.790" style="s2">have a spirituality where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.840" end="00:53:23.670" style="s2">parables and there&#39;s myths in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.790" end="00:53:27.870" style="s2">stories that reflect the same set of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.670" end="00:53:30.960" style="s2">commitments and that aren&#39;t come you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.870" end="00:53:33.610" style="s2">know competing or or working against</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.960" end="00:53:36.580" style="s2">those commitments so</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.610" end="00:53:39.100" style="s2">I want a spiritual life that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.580" end="00:53:41.710" style="s2">just like you all have different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.100" end="00:53:45.070" style="s2">expressing your intention your your your</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.710" end="00:53:49.540" style="s2">will that the the way there and storied</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.070" end="00:53:52.440" style="s2">now is liberated because we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.540" end="00:53:55.090" style="s2">clear on our set of commitments and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.440" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">these stories will come through</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.090" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">different cultures different group</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:04.630" style="s2">experiences different nomadic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:06.760" style="s2">different languages and and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.630" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">have to fight about that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.760" end="00:54:11.890" style="s2">always coming back to examining these</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:15.540" style="s2">fundamental commitments and they will</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.890" end="00:54:18.700" style="s2">also change I mean did they change the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.540" end="00:54:22.090" style="s2">way things changed now maybe by you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.700" end="00:54:27.910" style="s2">the year these aren&#39;t even is it even</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.090" end="00:54:35.080" style="s2">the spirituality we need so but these</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.910" end="00:54:37.570" style="s2">stories that they want to liberate the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.080" end="00:54:41.820" style="s2">ability to tell many many stories and</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.820" end="00:54:47.800" style="s2">spirituality I don&#39;t know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.160" end="00:54:56.830" style="s2">you&#39;re going but that&#39;s how it overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.800" end="00:54:58.660" style="s2">with stories for me well I I guess for</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.830" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">me it&#39;s like when you say that these far</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.660" end="00:55:02.380" style="s2">like the the fundamental commitments</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:05.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a hierarchy and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:08.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like story said a lower point of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.800" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">the hierarchy and that is where the I</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.260" end="00:55:12.430" style="s2">think the conflict arises for me because</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:17.260" style="s2">I would I feel like the story also owns</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.430" end="00:55:19.300" style="s2">me the story owns me so I I live in</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.260" end="00:55:20.520" style="s2">stories like I cannot see outside of my</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.300" end="00:55:24.820" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.520" end="00:55:26.920" style="s2">I feel so therefore I&#39;m just I I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.820" end="00:55:35.820" style="s2">separate a story from from the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.920" end="00:55:35.820" style="s2">things now it&#39;s interesting context</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.610" end="00:55:41.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s a tension between what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.410" end="00:55:58.430" style="s2">getting at and that experience I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.480" end="00:56:00.830" style="s2">say yes that&#39;s interesting I&#39;m not I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.430" end="00:56:02.540" style="s2">sort of missed the last little chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.830" end="00:56:08.470" style="s2">conversation that you had because I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.540" end="00:56:12.200" style="s2">in the chat and I&#39;m what you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.470" end="00:56:17.810" style="s2">talking about around will and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.200" end="00:56:22.340" style="s2">experience and the the the meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.810" end="00:56:25.190" style="s2">the practice that observes a will is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.340" end="00:56:28.220" style="s2">feeling it&#39;s hitting something I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.190" end="00:56:33.770" style="s2">jokingly but not really wrote BDSM into</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.220" end="00:56:35.480" style="s2">the chat and even before that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.770" end="00:56:38.170" style="s2">of contact improvisation which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.480" end="00:56:42.140" style="s2">something I did a for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.170" end="00:56:45.740" style="s2">because it felt like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.140" end="00:56:48.560" style="s2">really important there around like like</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.740" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">historically I healed it as humans have</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.560" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">been learned to repress our will our</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:59.750" style="s2">even our awareness of our own will as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:01.130" style="s2">way to control the masses and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.750" end="00:57:07.580" style="s2">that sement like you see that in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.130" end="00:57:10.610" style="s2">depression of sexual energy and so these</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.580" end="00:57:13.810" style="s2">practices like BDSM and keep in contact</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.610" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">improv which is not explicitly sexual is</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.810" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">really tracking those that what moves us</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.380" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">yeah so that that was Freud&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.810" end="00:57:28.220" style="s2">he said that all civilizations are based</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:32.390" style="s2">are founded on the suppression of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.220" end="00:57:37.310" style="s2">will so now we have an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.390" end="00:57:40.760" style="s2">question if we are the council from you</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:44.300" style="s2">know the other council from the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.760" end="00:57:46.250" style="s2">world to create a new spirituality for</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.300" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">the humans right because now the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.250" end="00:57:51.140" style="s2">question is if we have a spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:54.500" style="s2">can we have civilization</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.140" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">as we know it and I would say no I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.500" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">we need to let that whole trajectory die</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.840" end="00:58:08.930" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an interesting question I</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.220" end="00:58:11.270" style="s2">mean I kind of overstated made it a real</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.930" end="00:58:18.190" style="s2">big thing but that that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.270" end="00:58:21.620" style="s2">you&#39;re sensing what do we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.190" end="00:58:24.350" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s this long arc of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.620" end="00:58:28.850" style="s2">expansion of Geo social space more and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.350" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">more people under one cult object right</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.850" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">now the cult object is the market</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:37.820" style="s2">finance capitalism so that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:40.450" style="s2">mean by civilization it&#39;s grown so</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.820" end="00:58:43.100" style="s2">there&#39;s more territory and more people</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.450" end="00:58:45.950" style="s2">under one what George Herbert Mead</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.100" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">called cult an object or social object</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.950" end="00:58:57.170" style="s2">or social imaginary whatever so yes so</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:59:00.590" style="s2">this notion of not wanting people to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.170" end="00:59:03.650" style="s2">suffer but releasing the long arc of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.590" end="00:59:11.510" style="s2">civilization I think is is is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.650" end="00:59:14.860" style="s2">interwoven in there somehow there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.510" end="00:59:17.570" style="s2">something that&#39;s coming in for me about</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.860" end="00:59:20.300" style="s2">the attentional system and these</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.570" end="00:59:22.670" style="s2">practices that doesn&#39;t kind of like it</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.300" end="00:59:27.170" style="s2">seems like I meant to obliterate it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.670" end="00:59:28.760" style="s2">some way and I think about like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.170" end="00:59:31.730" style="s2">attentional system helps us notice</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.760" end="00:59:33.590" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and so if we obliterate</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.730" end="00:59:36.500" style="s2">the attentional system then we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.590" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">notice what&#39;s happening on earth we</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.500" end="00:59:40.700" style="s2">don&#39;t notice what&#39;s happening like we it</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:42.680" style="s2">feels like you can start to fail to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.700" end="00:59:48.710" style="s2">notice what&#39;s actually going on and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.680" end="00:59:50.870" style="s2">we need to act and yeah I really I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.710" end="00:59:53.000" style="s2">relate to it Tanya said I&#39;m also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.870" end="00:59:55.580" style="s2">longtime practitioner of contact</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.000" end="00:59:59.000" style="s2">improvisation and it has like changed</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.580" end="01:00:02.650" style="s2">the way that I feel myself and the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.000" end="01:00:02.650" style="s2">that I do my things</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.460" end="01:00:10.970" style="s2">and so I really I gravitate a lot toward</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:12.980" style="s2">this like intentionality that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.970" end="01:00:18.110" style="s2">talking about and like harnessing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.980" end="01:00:20.270" style="s2">will and I I think there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.110" end="01:00:22.790" style="s2">happening with a lot of these forums</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.270" end="01:00:24.590" style="s2">like this and other like podcasts and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.790" end="01:00:26.930" style="s2">stuff that I&#39;m listening to that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.590" end="01:00:29.060" style="s2">so much like there&#39;s all this like this</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.930" end="01:00:31.370" style="s2">like thought machine that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.060" end="01:00:33.740" style="s2">around these things and then I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.370" end="01:00:36.080" style="s2">these other places where I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.740" end="01:00:37.790" style="s2">exposed to like the Indian cosmovision</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.080" end="01:00:40.790" style="s2">and I&#39;m just like wow these people</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.790" end="01:00:45.980" style="s2">already have it mapped out like they got</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.790" end="01:00:48.860" style="s2">a map and it is like I wish that I wish</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.980" end="01:00:51.530" style="s2">to bridge the two and because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.860" end="01:00:55.070" style="s2">there&#39;s like multiple multiple steps</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.530" end="01:00:57.290" style="s2">ahead and ICS like referencing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.070" end="01:00:59.360" style="s2">European and Western thought and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.290" end="01:01:05.170" style="s2">like it feels like we&#39;re like grasping</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.360" end="01:01:08.290" style="s2">at something that is already happening I</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.170" end="01:01:10.460" style="s2">would say we&#39;re using the wrong system</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.290" end="01:01:12.380" style="s2">for the route you know it&#39;s like a tool</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.460" end="01:01:14.690" style="s2">the touchable system is one thing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.380" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">you&#39;re right it has we need that but</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.690" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">then there&#39;s the intentional system and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:24.170" style="s2">almost all our focus or the system we</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:27.020" style="s2">bring online to solve these problems or</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.170" end="01:01:29.660" style="s2">is more of the attentional system all</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.020" end="01:01:32.150" style="s2">the discourse around the virtuality of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.660" end="01:01:34.310" style="s2">self and salience realization in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.150" end="01:01:39.110" style="s2">perspective this is all the attentional</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.310" end="01:01:41.810" style="s2">system there&#39;s not the last thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.110" end="01:01:44.660" style="s2">wanted to say is that as far as like an</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.810" end="01:01:46.450" style="s2">intention goes a lot of traditions put</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.660" end="01:01:49.060" style="s2">forward the intention of friendship and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.450" end="01:01:51.350" style="s2">the intention of being a learner and</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.060" end="01:01:53.080" style="s2">always learning from your environment</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.350" end="01:01:57.670" style="s2">how to be a better friend</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.080" end="01:01:57.670" style="s2">so that just put</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.980" end="01:02:17.720" style="s2">okay I know aunt Rae is trying to is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.890" end="01:02:20.599" style="s2">reminding us yeah it&#39;s a part of France</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.720" end="01:02:22.670" style="s2">brentano&#39;s writing so he came up with</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.599" end="01:02:24.589" style="s2">the concept of intentionality and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.670" end="01:02:27.020" style="s2">when Martin Heidegger wrote being in</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.589" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">time he used intentionality is a core</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.020" end="01:02:32.900" style="s2">part of the and Edmund Husserl did as</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:36.770" style="s2">well and it&#39;s where a lot of our current</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.900" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">ontology stems from if you very before</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.770" end="01:02:43.790" style="s2">that it would be Immanuel Kant there he</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:53.059" style="s2">was bit more focused towards metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.790" end="01:02:58.099" style="s2">rather than a straight ontology yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.059" end="01:03:05.540" style="s2">this was a rewarding work for me thank</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.099" end="01:03:07.160" style="s2">you it was nice to have like a little</p>
