<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">on facebook to somebody and i used the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:10.160" style="s2">word incompetent in it</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">just directly referring to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.160" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">governments and corporations</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:16.400" style="s2">and all of the complex meta problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">that are there and i had to google</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.400" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">the definition of a competent because i</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.920" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:23.439" style="s2">be using it wrong and it was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">definition was something along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.439" end="00:00:27.039" style="s2">of they are inadequately equipped</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m like yep inadequate is good then</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.039" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">the corporations and governments are in</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:33.760" style="s2">no way able to solve our</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:34.960" style="s2">current problems we can with ten</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.760" end="00:00:36.160" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.960" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.160" end="00:00:39.920" style="s2">the comment was actually in response to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:41.200" style="s2">a request i put out there to find some</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">audacious</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.200" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">problems that a solution raising can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">tackle can&#39;t improve</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">with ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">thousand dollars and someone put up</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t actually tackled that yet</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">but then they offered a response</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">um of a solution and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like actually like the point</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">of a solution isn&#39;t to actually solve it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s to drastically improve it</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">either for the world or for those 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">members but for the world it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">ten thousand people can get together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.439" style="s2">create a new carbon tax that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:17.360" style="s2">demand everybody use</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.439" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">it&#39;s just not as it&#39;s not effective as</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.360" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">creating something that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">voluntary and what you want to put into</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">but this concept of incompetence</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">that who we currently have in power</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">who are all in positions of prestige are</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">the people who fake</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">competence are the people who either</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">themselves think they are qualified</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">and can present that to the world and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">our society is set up very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">for the overestimators and the risk</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">takers basically because they don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">the risk</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">so they&#39;re gonna go to take it like just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">think positively</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing the outfit the um</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">outcomes of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">that many of the businesses are failing</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">and the ones that aren&#39;t failing are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">being bailed out by the government</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">because not to disparage business owners</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">but those that were successful</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">had to have a high risk tolerance so</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">they you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">just can&#39;t sit on three months worth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">savings</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">knowing that a catastrophe is coming in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">the marketplace you have to spend it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">even if you would have preferred to save</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:19.599" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">and really the personalities themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.599" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">are uh again our society set up</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">to put people in positions of power that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">appear competent</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">but they are not competent in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">very people who we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">incompetent</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">have had the world not work for them are</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">actually the people who have a low risk</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">the underestimators are actually better</p>
