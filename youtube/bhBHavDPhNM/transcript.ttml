<p begin="00:00:04.069" end="00:00:10.349" style="s2">sam harris and jordan Peterson had these</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:11.849" style="s2">four debates over the summer you were</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.349" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">the moderator of two of those in</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.849" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">Vancouver what do you think was achieved</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">in them where do you think the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">lack of alignment is still and where do</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.460" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">you think this debate is I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">was accomplished in Vancouver and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:32.750" style="s2">less intimately familiar with what took</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">place in London and Dublin but in</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.750" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">Vancouver we started out with two people</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">who did not really know how much to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">trust each other and although they</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:46.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t arrive in the same place I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">believe they did come to a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.460" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">respect and even affection for each</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.539" end="00:00:55.140" style="s2">other that as far as I know persists to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">this day I think for each of them there</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">is a vindication in the distance that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">they traveled and then there&#39;s a bitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">pill and it&#39;s obviously much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">accept a vindication and a bitter pill</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">and so the real question is what in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">end will become of the two bitter pills</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">that they each have to face in Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">case the vindication is that in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">universe does not need some divine</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">entity to explain any of the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">that we see on the other hand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:35.150" style="s2">dismissal of people&#39;s religious beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:36.900" style="s2">as miss being misinformed or as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.150" end="00:01:40.549" style="s2">misunderstanding of the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.900" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">obviously not entirely satisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.549" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">these belief systems do appear to be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">product of forces that have shaped them</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">for a purpose essentially to benefit the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">people who - who hold these beliefs so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">Sam is grappling with the implications</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">of that in effect it is a challenge to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">simple new atheist perspective Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">in the situation of having a vindication</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">of his belief that these myths in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">he has argued that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">deal of meaning are in fact what he says</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.069" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">they are they are a kind of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:25.410" style="s2">they are profoundly important in human</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">history for him the bitter pill is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.410" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">they are not timeless there is no magic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">formula that would imbue them with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">ability to tell us what we should do in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:37.730" style="s2">novel circumstances because these myths</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:41.819" style="s2">are the product of adaptive evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.730" end="00:02:43.739" style="s2">they are limited in utility to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.819" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">circumstances in which they evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.739" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">because we live in circumstances that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">don&#39;t look anything like the situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">of thousands of years ago we should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">suspect of these stories and their</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:03:00.569" style="s2">relevance to our modern problems so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">think this has yet to play out and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.569" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">will be interesting to see where Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">and Sam end up wrestling with these</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">things going forward but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.730" style="s2">they can hear each other now and even to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">the point on the second night in</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.730" end="00:03:16.200" style="s2">Vancouver of being able to properly</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">steel man each other&#39;s position I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.200" end="00:03:21.600" style="s2">is tremendous progress and you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">about the archetypes so Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.600" end="00:03:26.280" style="s2">frames those as kind of pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">categories of being and you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.280" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">that they cannot possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:34.250" style="s2">pre-existing categories of being well</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">they can be to an extent but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.250" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">shorthand that we use when we teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:41.910" style="s2">evolution and what we say is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:44.190" style="s2">evolution adapts creatures to their</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.910" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">environment that is not what it does</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">evolution adapts creatures to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">environments of their ancestors and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">the reason it looks like it adapts</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">creatures to their environment is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">environments of one&#39;s ancestor tends to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">look like the environment that you find</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">yourself in but there are lots of places</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">in evolutionary history where that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">where a creature disperses over a divide</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:08.670" style="s2">or where something changes so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:11.850" style="s2">whatever was true for the ancestor is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.670" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">not true for the descendant we modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.850" end="00:04:16.910" style="s2">humans are in this circumstance in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:19.289" style="s2">that is arguably unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.910" end="00:04:21.659" style="s2">technology has rendered the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.289" end="00:04:24.599" style="s2">landscape novel and so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.659" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">there will be no element in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.599" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">mythology that carries over to this day</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">but overwhelmingly there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">mismatch between those myths and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.979" style="s2">modern circumstances so from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">perspective of should we treat them as</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.979" end="00:04:42.770" style="s2">god-given and learn from them no if ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">there was a time not to do that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.770" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">that time it&#39;s interesting you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">talking about archetypes because I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">quite a lot of people have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.229" style="s2">there&#39;s something about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">that&#39;s backward looking even though the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.229" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">details of when they question that when</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:04:59.870" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of described as the custodian</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:01.460" style="s2">of the patriarchy or whatever the detail</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.870" end="00:05:03.979" style="s2">of of that is usually a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:06.260" style="s2">misrepresentation but that there is at</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.979" end="00:05:08.180" style="s2">least an aspect of him that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.260" end="00:05:11.389" style="s2">backward facing in terms of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.180" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">recover old archetypes rather than say</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.389" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2">we could use these to create new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.760" end="00:05:19.160" style="s2">looking at the world well hey I do see</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:20.270" style="s2">some aspect of Jordan as</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.160" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">backward-looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.270" end="00:05:26.419" style="s2">I think the image of him that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">portrayed is way off you know he is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.419" end="00:05:31.750" style="s2">interesting mixture of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:34.940" style="s2">perspectives and very modern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.750" end="00:05:39.260" style="s2">so you know in a way he&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.940" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">hard to to properly paint there&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.260" end="00:05:46.070" style="s2">would argue a real value in an</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">authoritative voice putting the brakes</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.070" end="00:05:50.930" style="s2">on the embrace of everything new it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">not to say that I think we can live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.930" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">the world that I think Jordan probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.410" style="s2">expects would be best for us I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:06:01.370" style="s2">that&#39;s an untenable solution to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.410" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">problems however I also think a headlong</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.370" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">rush into everything shiny and new is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:14.599" style="s2">mistake and so in a way Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:17.479" style="s2">carved out the role of of Orthodoxy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.599" end="00:06:20.660" style="s2">to the extent that he now comes to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.479" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">perspective that recognizes the limits</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.660" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">of the inherited wisdom and says well we</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:28.490" style="s2">need to cautiously look forward and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.780" end="00:06:30.320" style="s2">figure out what we&#39;re gonna do now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.490" end="00:06:32.419" style="s2">we know that our myths are very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.320" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">noisy relative to our circumstances if</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.419" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">he does that people will hear it in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:38.150" style="s2">way that they can&#39;t hear it from</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:39.700" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s so enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.150" end="00:06:43.080" style="s2">what&#39;s novel that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.700" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">they erode their own credibility I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.080" end="00:06:52.870" style="s2">Peterson is restoring a burden of proof</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:56.230" style="s2">that is correct the burden of proof says</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.870" end="00:06:58.180" style="s2">do not change that which works unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:06:59.770" style="s2">you have a very good reason the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.180" end="00:07:01.540" style="s2">architecture we&#39;ve been handed is less</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.770" end="00:07:04.360" style="s2">and less functional so there&#39;s more and</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.430" end="00:11:15.480" style="s2">simply a mistake so this is the very</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:18.960" style="s2">same kind of logic that Darwin used for</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.480" end="00:11:21.270" style="s2">physiological traits he was sent an</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.960" end="00:11:23.940" style="s2">orchid from Madagascar that had a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.270" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">long nectar tube and reasoned that there</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.940" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">must be a moth out there with a - with a</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">death the moth became known to Western</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.500" end="00:11:39.570" style="s2">science my point is that logic simply</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:42.090" style="s2">extends into the cultural realm and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.570" end="00:11:43.890" style="s2">very clearly applies to extremely</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.090" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">expensive sets of beliefs that come</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:11:53.280" style="s2">because if they didn&#39;t it&#39;s all too easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.520" style="s2">to edit out the part that&#39;s just baggage</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.280" end="00:11:58.140" style="s2">and where do you think this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.520" end="00:12:00.540" style="s2">goes now do you think there&#39;s any sense</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.090" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">anymore I think what they have done is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.310" end="00:12:16.980" style="s2">they have established the landscape in</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:41.160" style="s2">just like it is in any scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.550" end="00:12:43.260" style="s2">exploration somebody discovers that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.160" end="00:12:46.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a set of phenomena to understand</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.089" end="00:12:52.830" style="s2">quite natural so if they&#39;re enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:54.300" style="s2">about having more discussions I&#39;d love</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.530" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">come to the conclusion that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.850" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">I am but I&#39;ve actually been made so</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:26.660" style="s2">uncomfortable by the simplicity of new</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:31.020" style="s2">atheism that my feeling is I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.660" end="00:14:33.480" style="s2">afford that saying atheist is now taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.020" end="00:14:35.400" style="s2">sides in a debate where I&#39;m not on one</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.480" end="00:14:37.950" style="s2">of these sides I would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.400" end="00:14:41.220" style="s2">completely hard-headed about what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.950" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">true in the universe but I do not want</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.220" end="00:14:46.920" style="s2">to back people into a corner whose</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:52.430" style="s2">beliefs arise through an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.920" end="00:14:57.210" style="s2">process so I hope one day that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.430" end="00:14:59.990" style="s2">particular discussion has had the stigma</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.210" end="00:15:02.940" style="s2">taken out of it so that it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.990" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">comfortable to embrace atheism as no</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.940" end="00:15:09.300" style="s2">more than a description of what is true</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:12.060" style="s2">about phenomena in the universe that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.300" end="00:15:13.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t carry an ideological component</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.060" end="00:15:14.850" style="s2">that as long as it carries an</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.080" end="00:15:17.610" style="s2">ideological component I&#39;m cautious about</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.850" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">saying that about myself so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.610" end="00:15:21.450" style="s2">that&#39;s why you chose the word sacred</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.640" style="s2">because for a new atheist that word</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.450" end="00:15:25.170" style="s2">would be meaningless so if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.640" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">meaningless for you what what does it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.170" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">mean and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:34.619" style="s2">well I see a a spectrum that runs from</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:37.230" style="s2">what I call the sacred to what I call</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.619" end="00:15:41.579" style="s2">the shamanistic and really this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.230" end="00:15:44.129" style="s2">spectrum of caution or would be caution</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.579" end="00:15:47.459" style="s2">about change there are some things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.129" end="00:15:49.860" style="s2">are so essential to basic function that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.459" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">you upend them as a last resort and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.860" end="00:15:55.829" style="s2">there are other things that you upend</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:57.629" style="s2">either because they don&#39;t have profound</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.829" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">implications or because they simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.629" end="00:16:02.610" style="s2">don&#39;t function as they are and you must</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:05.579" style="s2">change them so my sense is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.610" end="00:16:07.800" style="s2">a kind of distinction between the sorts</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.579" end="00:16:10.199" style="s2">of matters that we hand over to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:12.889" style="s2">priestly class the sacred these are</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.199" end="00:16:17.339" style="s2">things you don&#39;t upend willy-nilly and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.889" end="00:16:20.189" style="s2">the shamanistic stuff which is open to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.339" end="00:16:23.699" style="s2">interpretation that is open to you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.189" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">to hunches to following a thread and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.699" end="00:16:27.899" style="s2">seeing where it leads</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:30.839" style="s2">so the sacred is simply that stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.899" end="00:16:34.199" style="s2">is so fundamental to function that one</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.839" end="00:16:37.019" style="s2">ought not tinker casually hmm and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.199" end="00:16:39.509" style="s2">shamanistic shamanistic is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.019" end="00:16:41.699" style="s2">up for tinkering either because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.509" end="00:16:43.439" style="s2">implications aren&#39;t profound or because</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.699" end="00:16:44.610" style="s2">the implications are profound and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.439" end="00:16:47.339" style="s2">you&#39;ve been handed is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.610" end="00:16:50.629" style="s2">functional Brett thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.339" end="00:16:50.629" style="s2">you&#39;re very welcome</p>
