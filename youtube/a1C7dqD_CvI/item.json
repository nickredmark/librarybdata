    "description": "During this love-filled conversation in the Center for Integral Wisdom's course Becoming a Future Human, Barbara, Marc and Daniel spontaneously agree that they are part of an Evolutionary Family and delight in the joy of this! They continue to explore the themes of suprasex, the Co-creative Masculine, discovering vocation, and how to expand our love lists beyond romantic partners.\n\nDaniel remarks that one of the great teachings of suprasex is the question it begs: what am I committed to create in the world that is as significant as creating human life, that engages as much of my capacity, and that I am as committed to?\n\nIn this session you will:\n\n-Consider who your own evolutionary family is\n\n-Learn what it means to be telerotic\n\n-Why it is so attractive when we see people congruently living their teachings\n\n-Why itâ€™s important not to become suprasexually promiscuous\n\nView the entirety of this course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",
