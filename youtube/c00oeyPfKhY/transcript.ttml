<p begin="00:02:19.129" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">to this and definitely a lot of new</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.970" end="00:02:27.889" style="s2">faces and some people that I know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">definitely glad to be speaking on these</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.889" end="00:02:30.450" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:32.580" style="s2">so what I was going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.450" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">tonight or what I&#39;m thinking what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.580" end="00:02:36.209" style="s2">spending a lot of time thinking about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:39.620" style="s2">my life so the kind of work that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.209" end="00:02:42.930" style="s2">been engaged with these last few years</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.620" end="00:02:44.510" style="s2">basically has been centered around what</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.930" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">we would think of as chronic problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.510" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">particularly a big hairy audacious</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:52.370" style="s2">chronic problems the kind of things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">are complicated to such an extent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.370" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">we really couldn&#39;t expect a single</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">person to learn every aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">problem in a lifetime or that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">requires a broad variety of points of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">view to even get a sense as to what be</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">an appropriate response and so this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">kind of problem space shows up in things</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">like existential risk things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">basically really impactful on us on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.060" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">civilization scale and what would we be</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">calling the long-term conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">sustainable evolution ie what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">things would create sort of a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">thriving on the part of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">ourselves as species and an ecosystem in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:35.970" style="s2">that context so in effect you know when</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">we when we look at the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.970" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">government systems that exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">world today they&#39;re mostly designed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2">respond to acute situations hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">and police and and military and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:50.519" style="s2">kinds of congressional process to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:53.099" style="s2">judicial process and so on for the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.519" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">part are oriented around dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.099" end="00:03:58.169" style="s2">things as they come up and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s a need for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.169" end="00:04:01.919" style="s2">to address protocols because as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.060" end="00:04:04.919" style="s2">develop technology to a larger large</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.919" end="00:04:06.919" style="s2">extent or we utilize it more in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:09.590" style="s2">portion of the world essentially deploys</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.919" end="00:04:11.609" style="s2">computers and cell phones and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.590" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">automobiles and all the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.609" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">that goes with all that stuff that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">effect there&#39;s this sort of rebalancing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">that is needed in the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:22.889" style="s2">between man-machine and nature so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">effect we need to be able to think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.889" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">problems in ways that are much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:29.669" style="s2">long-term than say the next quarterly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:32.610" style="s2">report or the kinds of things that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.669" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">be done in a single election cycle so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.900" style="s2">here of you know for the toolkit that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.229" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">civilization gives us the kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.900" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">in which it addresses problems that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">obviously this toolkit solves a problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">it&#39;s used and it&#39;s the problem the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">problem solved but if we had like a sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">of collection of problems and some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">them are solved by the toolkit and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:56.669" style="s2">of them are not then over time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:59.070" style="s2">this residual class of problems that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.669" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">toolkit just doesn&#39;t address and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.070" end="00:05:01.950" style="s2">problems in that class have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:05.070" style="s2">accumulating for some time and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.950" end="00:05:07.320" style="s2">becoming quite important so in address</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.070" end="00:05:08.820" style="s2">to that most of the work that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.320" end="00:05:10.200" style="s2">doing has been thinking about okay well</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.820" end="00:05:12.810" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna be needed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.200" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">actually address those that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.810" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">problem ie things that are very chronic</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">what sort of facilities and resources</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:22.140" style="s2">would we need to have as a as a human</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">species to essentially be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.140" end="00:05:27.480" style="s2">address things like that so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">things that we could start to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.480" end="00:05:30.419" style="s2">could start to say okay well let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">at it as a coordinate coordinated action</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.419" end="00:05:34.229" style="s2">problem like we have a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">that wants to solve this particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.229" end="00:05:38.729" style="s2">issue and as as I&#39;m sure most of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">know that&#39;s not actually the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.729" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">thing to do first of all because people</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.780" style="s2">get involved in games of power there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:47.070" style="s2">lot of social dynamics that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.780" end="00:05:48.419" style="s2">emerge in that kind of space that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.070" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">actually makes it very difficult to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.419" end="00:05:53.150" style="s2">the kind of problem solving exercises</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:56.910" style="s2">that are needed to address these issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.150" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">we haven&#39;t as a as a species really come</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.910" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">up with a very good collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">brainstorming so system capacity you</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:08.640" style="s2">know that can really address long term</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">issues so in effect what we what we end</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.640" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">up doing is we start to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">insofar as we are looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:16.530" style="s2">relationship between man-machine in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:19.260" style="s2">nature then there&#39;s a kind of thing of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">okay well how do we think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.260" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">communities of action how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">about communities of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:27.450" style="s2">and so immediately we start to notice</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">that without sense-making without some</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.450" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">capacity to know what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">that even if we had a really effective</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">way of responding you know some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.090" style="s2">so metaphorically we can talk like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:40.530" style="s2">race car right so I could have a race</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.090" end="00:06:44.280" style="s2">car that has a really efficient engine</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.530" end="00:06:46.440" style="s2">it&#39;s really powerful it&#39;s got a really</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.280" end="00:06:47.760" style="s2">nice paint job it looks looks good fuel</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.440" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">efficient and all those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.760" end="00:06:51.150" style="s2">but if the car is going in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:53.030" style="s2">direction it just doesn&#39;t matter so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.150" end="00:06:56.550" style="s2">effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.030" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">needing to know what to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.550" end="00:07:02.820" style="s2">be able to guide any process that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:05.880" style="s2">effectively inform collective action so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.820" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">as a result of again just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.880" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">thinking about it that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:11.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to focus a lot on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">how do groups of people collectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.130" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">make sense of the world to to even just</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:20.100" style="s2">enable individual action let alone</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:21.540" style="s2">collective action so a lot of the work</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.100" end="00:07:23.340" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been doing recently is focused</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.540" end="00:07:24.510" style="s2">on sense making specifically the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.340" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">of things that would be needed for sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.510" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">making and what sort of orientations</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">would be needed to support that so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:35.820" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like again just orienting</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">sort of direction the next sort of layer</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.820" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">of this comes into the space of okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:43.550" style="s2">if we have a community of people say a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:45.980" style="s2">town or or some some motivated group</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.550" end="00:07:48.360" style="s2">what would be the ways in which that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.980" end="00:07:49.410" style="s2">sense making process would happen so in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.360" end="00:07:51.090" style="s2">other words if we&#39;re going to put some</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.410" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">sort of system in place or some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.090" end="00:07:56.460" style="s2">capacity in place or or to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:57.540" style="s2">capacity in that group then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.460" end="00:07:58.890" style="s2">start thinking about the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.540" end="00:08:02.300" style="s2">agreements that would be in place to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.890" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">that but that didn&#39;t immediately lets us</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.300" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">encourages us to start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:07.710" style="s2">well what is the infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">supports agreements if I&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:11.040" style="s2">business for example you can think of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.960" end="00:08:13.560" style="s2">business entity as being like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.040" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">collection of agreements it&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a employment contracts and vendor</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.090" style="s2">agreements and rent agreements and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:22.320" style="s2">all sorts of legal documents one way or</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.090" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">another that collectively form the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.320" end="00:08:27.090" style="s2">corporation but most people you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:29.100" style="s2">while the state might describe it that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.090" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">way most people don&#39;t think of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.100" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">corporation as being a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:34.500" style="s2">agreements I think it actually as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:35.910" style="s2">collection of people and people that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.500" end="00:08:37.710" style="s2">have capacities you know you might think</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.910" end="00:08:40.830" style="s2">about tools and capital and things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.710" end="00:08:43.740" style="s2">that but basically without some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.830" end="00:08:45.300" style="s2">relationship structure network of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:46.410" style="s2">relationships then you don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.300" end="00:08:49.620" style="s2">a company you don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.410" end="00:08:50.730" style="s2">community so in effect when we start</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.620" end="00:08:53.100" style="s2">thinking about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.730" end="00:08:54.780" style="s2">the network of agreements and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.100" end="00:08:57.300" style="s2">network of relationships becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.780" end="00:09:00.270" style="s2">clear that the capacity to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:03.420" style="s2">agreements in in culture or in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.270" end="00:09:06.780" style="s2">society in any organization depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:09.090" style="s2">the robustness of the relationships if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.780" end="00:09:10.440" style="s2">make an agreement with my neighbor to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.090" end="00:09:12.930" style="s2">maintain the fence for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.440" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">six years but they move away in three</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:16.290" style="s2">months then the validity of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">agreement just isn&#39;t that good in other</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.290" end="00:09:20.910" style="s2">words we we really only have capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:24.690" style="s2">trust the agreements to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.910" end="00:09:25.860" style="s2">we trust the relationships and so when</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.690" end="00:09:27.780" style="s2">we start thinking about okay well what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.860" end="00:09:30.530" style="s2">kinds of network of relationships do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.780" end="00:09:35.210" style="s2">need in order to really think about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.530" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">as a as a capacity building for</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.210" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">sense-making then then we start to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:42.900" style="s2">immediately start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:44.280" style="s2">communications you know when I think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.900" end="00:09:45.900" style="s2">a relationship with another person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.280" end="00:09:47.370" style="s2">thinking about all of the communications</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.900" end="00:09:50.970" style="s2">that I&#39;ve had with them all the complete</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.370" end="00:09:52.620" style="s2">history of our interactions and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.970" end="00:09:53.880" style="s2">particularly for close relationships I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.620" end="00:09:55.650" style="s2">might also think about the potential</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.880" end="00:09:56.960" style="s2">communications I could have all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.650" end="00:10:00.690" style="s2">things we could do together</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.960" end="00:10:03.060" style="s2">so in other words if you treat the you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.690" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">know just every moment of time you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.060" end="00:10:06.030" style="s2">every time I see them under seating</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.950" style="s2">messages in the form of what I see but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.030" end="00:10:08.400" style="s2">also what they say and and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.950" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.400" end="00:10:13.590" style="s2">that in effect that the content of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">relationship is that is the total</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.590" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">experience of the of the communication</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:22.140" style="s2">that I have with each person and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:24.090" style="s2">within the community so then we start to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.140" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2">think about sense making in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.090" end="00:10:27.960" style="s2">communication practices rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:29.160" style="s2">thinking about it in terms of agreements</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.960" end="00:10:30.690" style="s2">or relationships directly we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.160" end="00:10:33.960" style="s2">talking about what are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.690" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">communication practices that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.960" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">capacity for sense-making particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:40.350" style="s2">capacity for sense-making for big hairy</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:41.490" style="s2">audacious problems because those are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.350" end="00:10:42.900" style="s2">kind of problems that we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.490" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">capacity to deal with very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.900" end="00:10:48.960" style="s2">currently so you know this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.250" style="s2">just kind of giving an overview of some</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.960" end="00:10:52.170" style="s2">of my thinking around these things and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.250" end="00:10:56.190" style="s2">the idea here is I said if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.170" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">to actually work on the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.190" end="00:10:59.640" style="s2">communications that enable sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">when we start to notice that certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.640" end="00:11:04.440" style="s2">things are really helpful we really want</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.890" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">to get into what is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.440" end="00:11:09.690" style="s2">nature of what allows for genuine</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:11.820" style="s2">communication to actually create sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.690" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">making as a result in other words in</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.820" end="00:11:17.850" style="s2">what way does reason or rationality or</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:21.690" style="s2">perspective or insights or an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.850" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">of principles or wisdom results from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.690" end="00:11:26.569" style="s2">very nature of the dialogue process</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:29.610" style="s2">very nature of the collaboration process</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.569" end="00:11:31.230" style="s2">so in that sense I found myself becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.610" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">quite interested in collaboration as</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.230" end="00:11:34.529" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.220" end="00:11:37.619" style="s2">and as a kind of art form as well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.529" end="00:11:40.829" style="s2">began over the over this time to really</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.619" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">come to appreciate conversation as an</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.829" end="00:11:44.850" style="s2">artful and dialogue is an apt one you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:48.230" style="s2">know really think about wit and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.850" end="00:11:52.529" style="s2">degree to which those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.230" end="00:11:55.529" style="s2">interactive processes emerge and evolve</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.529" end="00:11:58.429" style="s2">a capacity for perspective and insight</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.529" end="00:12:01.529" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.429" end="00:12:03.990" style="s2">so you know again connected to this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.529" end="00:12:05.610" style="s2">other body of work the metaphysics was</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.990" end="00:12:08.209" style="s2">mentioned I was I was given certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.610" end="00:12:11.429" style="s2">tools to think about this so for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.209" end="00:12:13.679" style="s2">one of the insights that came from from</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.429" end="00:12:15.269" style="s2">thinking about relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.679" end="00:12:17.129" style="s2">communication theory and information</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.269" end="00:12:20.670" style="s2">theory and things like that is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.129" end="00:12:23.249" style="s2">communication as a process happens when</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.670" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">each participant grants to the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.249" end="00:12:26.129" style="s2">participant so scientists in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:29.160" style="s2">one-to-one conversation with another</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.129" end="00:12:32.519" style="s2">person that each person grants to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.160" end="00:12:34.769" style="s2">other the right to speak the right to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.519" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2">understood and the right to know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.769" end="00:12:39.149" style="s2">they have been understood and these are</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.839" end="00:12:41.999" style="s2">just given they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.149" end="00:12:43.799" style="s2">demanded you can&#39;t you can&#39;t ask for</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.999" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">these things but you can you can give</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.799" end="00:12:48.420" style="s2">them voluntarily to your teary pardon</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:52.049" style="s2">and hopefully your partner will also</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.420" end="00:12:54.629" style="s2">give those same three rights to you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.049" end="00:12:57.829" style="s2">and when that handshake happens when</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.629" end="00:13:00.329" style="s2">each party gives the three to the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.829" end="00:13:02.879" style="s2">then communication in this true sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.329" end="00:13:05.309" style="s2">becomes possible so in effect there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.879" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of reciprocity that goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.309" end="00:13:09.720" style="s2">on but it&#39;s not a reciprocity of quid</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:14.069" style="s2">pro quo of this for that it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.720" end="00:13:17.929" style="s2">mutual gifting the the sort of autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.069" end="00:13:21.720" style="s2">that Burning Man would sort of encourage</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.929" end="00:13:23.819" style="s2">so it&#39;s in that process that we can now</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.720" end="00:13:27.089" style="s2">actually have some sort of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.819" end="00:13:28.769" style="s2">that allows for collective emergence a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.089" end="00:13:31.170" style="s2">kind of embodiment of wisdom to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.769" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">shared between two people in the debt</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.170" end="00:13:38.910" style="s2">that sharing process essentially emerges</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:41.670" style="s2">a new phenomenon of wisdom because you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.910" end="00:13:43.410" style="s2">can see from two points of view so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.670" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2">the idea of perspective taking starts to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.410" end="00:13:48.509" style="s2">become really important so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.860" end="00:13:50.130" style="s2">you know to grant the other the right to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.509" end="00:13:51.240" style="s2">be understood and for them to know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.130" end="00:13:54.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been understood is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.240" end="00:13:57.690" style="s2">essentially to enable a capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.680" end="00:13:59.940" style="s2">something that in some fields is called</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.690" end="00:14:03.480" style="s2">phase parallax so for example we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.940" end="00:14:05.100" style="s2">two eyeballs right and if I just cover</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.480" end="00:14:08.220" style="s2">up one I&#39;m gonna see a two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.100" end="00:14:10.130" style="s2">field of vision if I basically have both</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.220" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening is that these two</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.130" end="00:14:15.380" style="s2">two dimensional fields of information</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:18.029" style="s2">are being combined and in my brain and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.380" end="00:14:20.579" style="s2">this happens for everybody that has two</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.029" end="00:14:24.089" style="s2">eyeballs basically that work well and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.579" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">that the emergence of a third dimension</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.089" end="00:14:29.389" style="s2">like because I see two slightly</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:31.800" style="s2">different perspectives I can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.389" end="00:14:34.620" style="s2">identify how far away something is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.800" end="00:14:35.699" style="s2">it&#39;s it partly by the separation in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.620" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">other words if they were in the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.699" end="00:14:38.910" style="s2">place then they wouldn&#39;t be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:40.649" style="s2">from two different perspectives in such</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.910" end="00:14:43.560" style="s2">a way to get a sense by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.649" end="00:14:45.899" style="s2">triangulation from the two eyes how far</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.560" end="00:14:47.910" style="s2">away it is so in other words if I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.899" end="00:14:49.529" style="s2">take and add two to two dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.910" end="00:14:50.819" style="s2">fields of information on top of one</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.529" end="00:14:52.829" style="s2">another I&#39;m still going to have a two</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.819" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">dimensional field of information but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.829" end="00:14:56.819" style="s2">I integrate the information then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">going to get this third dimension I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.819" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">going to end up with this new capacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">that emerges out of the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:05.579" style="s2">the two points of view so in effect when</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:08.069" style="s2">were when we&#39;re looking at communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.579" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">as a process it&#39;s not so much that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:10.500" style="s2">just trying to advocate our point of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:11.699" style="s2">view to the other person that the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.500" end="00:15:13.410" style="s2">person&#39;s trying to convince us that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.699" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">their point of view we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.410" end="00:15:16.290" style="s2">interested in doing is is that each</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">person is trying to see through the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.290" end="00:15:20.670" style="s2">of the other while also being able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:22.050" style="s2">see through their own eyes or see</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.670" end="00:15:23.910" style="s2">through the experience and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.050" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">narrative of the other person as well as</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.910" end="00:15:28.589" style="s2">the narrative that they themselves have</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:30.269" style="s2">so that through the synthesis not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.589" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">the addition but the synthesis of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.269" end="00:15:36.199" style="s2">two perspectives that effectively a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:39.089" style="s2">dimension of insight becomes possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.199" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">everybody in the world has a good story</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.089" end="00:15:42.930" style="s2">they have the story of their lives which</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:46.319" style="s2">is essentially a unique perspective we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.930" end="00:15:48.610" style="s2">all walk our own unique path and so in</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.319" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">effect what happens is that by being</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.610" end="00:15:53.769" style="s2">able to see from two perspectives I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">gain an insight into a situation through</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.769" end="00:15:57.459" style="s2">the depth of their experience combined</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:15:59.290" style="s2">with the depth of my experience so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.459" end="00:16:00.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a skill there to actually join</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.290" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">those two capacities to do the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.930" end="00:16:05.829" style="s2">perspective taking necessary to be able</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:07.630" style="s2">to genuinely walk in the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.829" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">shoes without losing memory of my own</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.630" end="00:16:13.149" style="s2">state and then obviously if the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">person is doing that as well then then</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.149" end="00:16:16.810" style="s2">there&#39;s an insight to de gain and now we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.260" style="s2">can start to share those insights so a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.810" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">meta level of insight becomes possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.260" end="00:16:27.070" style="s2">and and so it sits in the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">this that we really begin to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.070" end="00:16:31.810" style="s2">deep love for conversation deep love for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.810" end="00:16:33.310" style="s2">dialogue there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.810" end="00:16:35.019" style="s2">opening that happens there one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:37.930" style="s2">other things that the metaphysics was</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.019" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">given an awareness of is that joy is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.930" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">when there is a is an experience it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:45.550" style="s2">feeling that we have when we perceive an</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">increase in the potentialities available</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">to self so when I can perceive these</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:53.320" style="s2">deepenings these new these new insights</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:54.699" style="s2">then all of a sudden new possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.320" end="00:16:57.459" style="s2">emerge and that&#39;s usually a joyous</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.699" end="00:17:00.130" style="s2">experience because that opening and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.459" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">expansiveness of possible perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.130" end="00:17:05.740" style="s2">and therefore possible actions is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">something that we experience in a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.740" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">beneficial way there&#39;s a visit there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:12.220" style="s2">moment of joyousness in that process and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:14.980" style="s2">so as a result there&#39;s of worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.220" end="00:17:16.449" style="s2">Natur engaging in the practice for its</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.980" end="00:17:19.569" style="s2">own sake not just for the outcome that</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.449" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">it could produce so you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.569" end="00:17:24.370" style="s2">things that has been sort of noticed</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:26.919" style="s2">along the same lines is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.370" end="00:17:30.549" style="s2">look at language language has basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.919" end="00:17:31.990" style="s2">three three aspects of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.549" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">expressed some thinking from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.990" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">linguistics perspective particularly we</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">can use language to make statements such</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:41.350" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:43.000" style="s2">I&#39;m doing at this moment on making</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.350" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">certain claims I&#39;m saying eh this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:45.549" style="s2">some of the things I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">this is some of the ways and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.549" end="00:17:49.990" style="s2">about them and those claims could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">evaluated in various ways as may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.990" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">helpful or not but we could issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.200" style="s2">directives I could say something to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">somebody and say hey could you please</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.200" end="00:18:00.070" style="s2">get me a glass of water or you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.630" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">would you shut the door or well you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.070" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">we can give instructions to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:05.210" style="s2">and then the third thing that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:08.510" style="s2">with language is that we can ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.210" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">questions and so when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.510" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">basically think about the kinds of roles</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">that statements have and the various</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:17.270" style="s2">characterization so at this point we</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:19.750" style="s2">have three kinds of things we can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.270" end="00:18:22.040" style="s2">with language the three sort of basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.750" end="00:18:25.070" style="s2">coordinating intentionality x&#39; that sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.040" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">of subsume the space of all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.070" end="00:18:30.070" style="s2">different things you can do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:32.450" style="s2">language at least in one perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.070" end="00:18:33.980" style="s2">then then we can start to say okay what</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.450" end="00:18:36.040" style="s2">is the wall of identity what is the wall</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.980" end="00:18:39.310" style="s2">of relationship how do we think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.040" end="00:18:41.660" style="s2">the dynamics of what happens in exchange</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.310" end="00:18:44.300" style="s2">when when one person makes a statement</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.660" end="00:18:46.040" style="s2">to the other versus when one person</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.300" end="00:18:49.250" style="s2">makes a demand of another or when one</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.040" end="00:18:50.930" style="s2">person asks the question of another and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.250" end="00:18:52.490" style="s2">and so when we when we look at that from</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.930" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">the point of view of identity and egoic</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.490" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">structures and things like that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:57.500" style="s2">notice that when a person makes a claim</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.510" style="s2">they have a little bit of their own</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:02.420" style="s2">identity tied in but if they are saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.510" end="00:19:04.070" style="s2">acts and so if a person challenges what</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.420" end="00:19:06.410" style="s2">they say then then you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.070" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">gonna be a desire to defend that or to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.410" end="00:19:11.570" style="s2">you know try to convince people that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:14.450" style="s2">it&#39;s true and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.570" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">if I&#39;m basically asking somebody to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.450" end="00:19:17.450" style="s2">something there&#39;s also kind of echoic</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:19.340" style="s2">structure tied up in that in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.450" end="00:19:21.530" style="s2">you know I&#39;m trying to exercise</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:24.230" style="s2">authority or power or something like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.530" end="00:19:27.770" style="s2">that to to convince someone to shift</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.230" end="00:19:29.180" style="s2">their behavior on my behalf or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.770" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">even on their behalf obviously you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.180" end="00:19:32.510" style="s2">ask people to do things for their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:35.090" style="s2">benefit as well but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.510" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">capacity here where when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.090" end="00:19:40.280" style="s2">the relationship between self-identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:42.920" style="s2">in the communication process and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.280" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">think about questions we notice</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.920" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">questions are actually a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:47.410" style="s2">different in terms of their egoic</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:51.020" style="s2">identifications and statements and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.410" end="00:19:54.410" style="s2">directives when we&#39;re asking a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.020" end="00:19:57.350" style="s2">we&#39;re basically not so ego eclis tied up</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.410" end="00:19:59.330" style="s2">into it I mean it can be I mean for some</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.350" end="00:20:02.060" style="s2">people there&#39;s this sort of social</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.330" end="00:20:03.620" style="s2">cultural thing that you know to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.060" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">question is to reveal a kind of weakness</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.620" end="00:20:09.290" style="s2">or to then you know to admit that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:12.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know something is some cases you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.290" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">know socially resisted a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.310" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">ultimately when we when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:19.850" style="s2">this in a more transcultural way or we</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:21.410" style="s2">will sort of factor out that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.850" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">cultural aspects but just looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.410" end="00:20:25.730" style="s2">Agila castex it&#39;s usually less the case</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.140" style="s2">that there is an egoic identification</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.730" end="00:20:29.390" style="s2">when asking question there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.140" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">intellectual humility that goes with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.390" end="00:20:34.520" style="s2">that and so if we&#39;re if really</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.500" style="s2">encouraging sense making fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.520" end="00:20:38.150" style="s2">then you know when we&#39;re when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.500" end="00:20:39.650" style="s2">looking at this phase parallax process</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.150" end="00:20:42.890" style="s2">of how do we gain insight and so and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.650" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">forth well immediately if two people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.890" end="00:20:46.730" style="s2">basically asking a question and both of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.080" end="00:20:49.250" style="s2">them are in inquiry about something then</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.730" end="00:20:50.990" style="s2">then rather than you know coming up</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.250" end="00:20:53.030" style="s2">against one another as would be the case</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.990" end="00:20:55.040" style="s2">with a statement or with with directives</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.030" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">they turn and they they&#39;re both sitting</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.040" end="00:20:57.920" style="s2">side by side and they&#39;re both looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">out into the world to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.920" end="00:21:02.810" style="s2">what&#39;s going on so if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:05.180" style="s2">emphasis is sense-making and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.810" end="00:21:06.830" style="s2">emphasis is of developing insight in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.180" end="00:21:08.030" style="s2">this phase parallax process of being</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:10.160" style="s2">able to perceive from multiple</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.030" end="00:21:12.790" style="s2">perspectives or to be able to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.160" end="00:21:14.690" style="s2">questions from multiple dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.790" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">therefore it becomes kind of a really</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.690" end="00:21:19.940" style="s2">important exercise so in that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:21.800" style="s2">sense I was led to sort of explore this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.940" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">phenomenon called ephemeral due process</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.800" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">which is how do we take small groups of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:29.150" style="s2">people and create a kind of context in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:31.730" style="s2">container for them to explore questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.150" end="00:21:33.890" style="s2">to essentially engage and an alternative</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.970" end="00:21:42.140" style="s2">something that&#39;s important how do we</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.810" end="00:21:52.070" style="s2">problem solving community sense making</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.690" end="00:21:53.870" style="s2">so on one hand you know we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.070" end="00:21:55.400" style="s2">questions as part of the dynamic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.870" end="00:21:57.170" style="s2">looking at insight looking at phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.400" end="00:21:59.290" style="s2">parallax looking at perspective taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.170" end="00:22:03.490" style="s2">and that the kinds of things that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.290" end="00:22:06.590" style="s2">facilitate high quality conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:08.270" style="s2">developing a series of techniques about</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.270" end="00:22:13.490" style="s2">how to engage in this in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:15.740" style="s2">dialog process so that represents</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.490" end="00:22:18.950" style="s2">essentially a body of work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.740" end="00:22:20.840" style="s2">currently being engaged within that work</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.950" end="00:22:23.990" style="s2">we&#39;re actually seeking support to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.840" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">continue to do but the main thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.990" end="00:22:28.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a need to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:30.590" style="s2">think about this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.280" end="00:22:32.630" style="s2">to scale to because it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.590" end="00:22:34.430" style="s2">know how do we help people who already</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.630" end="00:22:37.490" style="s2">want to be in conversation to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.430" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">problem to to encourage them to do so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.490" end="00:22:41.930" style="s2">a genuine way that actually can work on</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.370" style="s2">the kinds of issues the big hairy</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.930" end="00:22:46.430" style="s2">audacious problems associated with</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.370" end="00:22:49.850" style="s2">things like existential risk and things</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.430" end="00:22:52.120" style="s2">of that matter so you know in one hand</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.850" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">we can rely a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.120" end="00:22:57.170" style="s2">evolutionary propensity that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.470" end="00:22:58.660" style="s2">to seek meaning to see patterns to to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.170" end="00:23:03.560" style="s2">look for things that are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.660" end="00:23:04.790" style="s2">even the most rudimentary conversations</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.560" end="00:23:05.990" style="s2">and they walk up to one of your friends</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.790" end="00:23:09.260" style="s2">and you say have you seen any good</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.990" end="00:23:11.540" style="s2">movies lately you know we&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.260" end="00:23:13.850" style="s2">sense making capacity that the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.540" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">person has their perspectives to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.850" end="00:23:17.270" style="s2">identify you know what are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:18.560" style="s2">movies what things stood out for them</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.270" end="00:23:20.440" style="s2">what things did they think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.560" end="00:23:23.420" style="s2">particularly good or particularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.440" end="00:23:26.060" style="s2">interesting and worthwhile as a desert</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.420" end="00:23:29.660" style="s2">we could say entertainment but but an</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.060" end="00:23:31.970" style="s2">experience to have and so you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.660" end="00:23:33.740" style="s2">if we know what our friend is like and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.970" end="00:23:35.870" style="s2">what they like and and so on so forth</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.740" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">then we can gain a perspective that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.870" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">essentially allows us to have more</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">meaningful experiences in our lives more</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">interesting and worthwhile experiences</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">so that the sort of wisdom seeking</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">capacity is still kind of happening in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:52.760" style="s2">the background regardless but anyways if</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:53.870" style="s2">we if we&#39;re looking at it from the point</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.760" end="00:23:56.780" style="s2">of view of you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.870" end="00:23:58.610" style="s2">intentionality so remember we mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.780" end="00:24:00.020" style="s2">egoic structures a minute ago and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.610" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">saying okay well if we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.020" end="00:24:04.310" style="s2">looking to solve big hairy audacious</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">problems and we&#39;re still wanting to sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">of avoid the entanglements that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:11.330" style="s2">arise when you know large groups of</p>

<p begin="00:24:14.120" end="00:24:18.740" style="s2">need to actually start looking at sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.550" end="00:24:20.150" style="s2">of evolutionary dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.740" end="00:24:22.160" style="s2">essentially result in human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.150" end="00:24:23.990" style="s2">like what kinds of things like our</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.990" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">essentially do sense making what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.880" end="00:24:31.940" style="s2">of propensity is exist and and so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:34.120" style="s2">kind of you know we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.940" end="00:24:37.370" style="s2">the human condition really really well</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.120" end="00:24:40.039" style="s2">to do work in this space and for several</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.370" end="00:24:42.519" style="s2">reasons one of them is that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.039" end="00:24:44.929" style="s2">you know the human evolutionary pattern</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.519" end="00:24:46.429" style="s2">drives a lot of our behavior drives a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.929" end="00:24:48.830" style="s2">lot of the biases and our thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.429" end="00:24:50.749" style="s2">so on so forth but it also creates the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.830" end="00:24:51.979" style="s2">kind of motivations and the motivational</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.749" end="00:24:53.749" style="s2">base is supposed to engage in these</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.979" end="00:24:55.909" style="s2">kinds of activities so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.909" end="00:24:59.509" style="s2">that we need to be able to work around</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.899" end="00:25:02.929" style="s2">and and and also a kind of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.509" end="00:25:05.119" style="s2">that while we can&#39;t necessarily change</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.929" end="00:25:08.059" style="s2">the human condition we can work with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.119" end="00:25:08.899" style="s2">and so in effect you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.059" end="00:25:10.369" style="s2">looking at the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.899" end="00:25:13.399" style="s2">man-machine and nature and was</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.369" end="00:25:15.259" style="s2">essentially observing that and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.399" end="00:25:18.379" style="s2">has talked about this a bit you know in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.259" end="00:25:21.080" style="s2">some of his podcasts and things then</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.379" end="00:25:22.129" style="s2">Daniel and Jordan I&#39;m basically not</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.080" end="00:25:23.809" style="s2">trying to repeat things that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.129" end="00:25:25.159" style="s2">already said simply because you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.809" end="00:25:26.479" style="s2">we&#39;ve been collaborating for some time</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.159" end="00:25:28.789" style="s2">and they&#39;ve taken a fair bit of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.479" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">content into the world already but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.789" end="00:25:34.309" style="s2">idea here is is that when we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:35.659" style="s2">at how do we essentially solve big big</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.309" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">difficult problems that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.659" end="00:25:39.769" style="s2">very chronic you need a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:41.599" style="s2">communication process that can work at</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.769" end="00:25:44.749" style="s2">scale without becoming entangled in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.599" end="00:25:46.599" style="s2">kind of biases and issues the the power</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.749" end="00:25:48.619" style="s2">asymmetry structures that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.599" end="00:25:52.909" style="s2">emerge directly out of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.619" end="00:25:56.599" style="s2">between machine process and human</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.909" end="00:25:59.119" style="s2">process so for example when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.599" end="00:26:02.239" style="s2">evolutionary systems and ecosystems in</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.119" end="00:26:04.070" style="s2">particular conflict occurs in a context</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.239" end="00:26:05.830" style="s2">and the overall system itself is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.070" end="00:26:09.619" style="s2">actually very much more cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.830" end="00:26:11.359" style="s2">there are certain things that occur in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.619" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">nature that are deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.359" end="00:26:15.739" style="s2">cooperative processes they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:17.450" style="s2">necessarily obvious you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.739" end="00:26:19.009" style="s2">look at a system it&#39;s easier to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.450" end="00:26:20.929" style="s2">the conflict than it is to perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.009" end="00:26:22.429" style="s2">cooperation and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.929" end="00:26:22.940" style="s2">metaphysical reasons and why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.429" end="00:26:25.789" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:27.999" style="s2">having largely to do with the very</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.789" end="00:26:31.519" style="s2">nature of the process itself if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.999" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">you know an interruption of flow and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.519" end="00:26:33.710" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna perceive where that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:36.259" style="s2">interruptions happening because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.710" end="00:26:37.729" style="s2">creating a sort of barrier of sorts and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.259" end="00:26:39.799" style="s2">that barrier becomes an object that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.729" end="00:26:41.239" style="s2">makes it possible to proceed it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.799" end="00:26:43.479" style="s2">things are flowing easily then you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.239" end="00:26:45.470" style="s2">see through them they become transparent</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.479" end="00:26:46.669" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more I can say about those</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.470" end="00:26:49.580" style="s2">dynamics but I just want to summarize</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.669" end="00:26:52.290" style="s2">roughly here so anyways the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.580" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">is that cooperation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.290" end="00:26:56.730" style="s2">not only present and hard to see but</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.970" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s actually the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.730" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">context in which ecosystems essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.970" end="00:27:04.470" style="s2">that the ecosystem creates this this</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">cooperative process and if there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.470" end="00:27:08.580" style="s2">interest reasons conflict or entrust</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.090" end="00:27:10.280" style="s2">species conflicts that occur you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.580" end="00:27:12.660" style="s2">for a mate selection or things like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.280" end="00:27:14.450" style="s2">it&#39;s held in the larger container of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.660" end="00:27:18.930" style="s2">ecosystem in the ecosystem itself is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.450" end="00:27:20.820" style="s2">autopoietic to a large degree whereas</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.930" end="00:27:22.710" style="s2">when we look at machine process machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.820" end="00:27:24.600" style="s2">process doesn&#39;t presume a larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.710" end="00:27:27.390" style="s2">cooperative context and so as a result</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.600" end="00:27:29.490" style="s2">when we are orienting raw machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.390" end="00:27:32.220" style="s2">process the the nature of the asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.490" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">of power distributions that machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.220" end="00:27:37.380" style="s2">technology creates that&#39;s my clock going</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:42.870" style="s2">on in the background over there</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.380" end="00:27:44.190" style="s2">anyways that when we when we look at you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.870" end="00:27:46.980" style="s2">know essentially a larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.190" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">proportion of machine usage then</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.980" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">effectively what happens is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.040" style="s2">co-operative context of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.700" end="00:27:54.510" style="s2">becomes too stabilized I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.040" end="00:27:56.820" style="s2">talking about issues associated with</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.510" end="00:27:58.260" style="s2">pollution I&#39;m actually talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:00.900" style="s2">kinds of things that emerge access to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.260" end="00:28:02.190" style="s2">risk fundamentally daniel talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.900" end="00:28:03.860" style="s2">about the generator functions of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.190" end="00:28:06.150" style="s2">existential risk and we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.860" end="00:28:08.060" style="s2">the kind of problem dynamics there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.150" end="00:28:10.170" style="s2">lots of different ways to describe</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.060" end="00:28:12.420" style="s2">fundamentally what are the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.170" end="00:28:13.860" style="s2">problems and and and lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.420" end="00:28:16.020" style="s2">ways to describe it each of which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.860" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">comprehensive with the political within</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.020" end="00:28:20.430" style="s2">its own context I&#39;m not going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.600" end="00:28:21.690" style="s2">go into all those statements here you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.430" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">know the three of us have worked on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.690" end="00:28:26.010" style="s2">issue for some time and it actually come</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">to some pretty concise descriptions but</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.010" end="00:28:31.950" style="s2">the idea here is is that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">basically be able to shift the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.950" end="00:28:35.730" style="s2">relationship from the relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.900" end="00:28:38.220" style="s2">the relationship between man machine and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.730" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">nature because if we don&#39;t then what</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.220" end="00:28:42.570" style="s2">ends up happening is is that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:44.700" style="s2">destabilization of you know man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.570" end="00:28:45.990" style="s2">relationship to nature the man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.700" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">relationship to machines and machines</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.990" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">relation to nature such that nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">suffers so effectively the 25 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:54.330" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:56.210" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try to wrap up and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.330" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">essentially what happens is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.210" end="00:29:03.810" style="s2">the dynamic of cooperation that nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:05.130" style="s2">and ecosystems normally have needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.810" end="00:29:05.910" style="s2">risa ported so in other words rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.130" end="00:29:08.820" style="s2">than having</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.910" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2">machines and service demand we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.820" end="00:29:13.020" style="s2">machines to be in service to nature and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:14.700" style="s2">to some extent man service to machines</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.020" end="00:29:16.860" style="s2">so that it can be in service to nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.700" end="00:29:18.840" style="s2">so the nature can provide the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">ecosystem necessary to support life ie</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.840" end="00:29:24.510" style="s2">our own included with that we have as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">species with someone naive impression</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.510" end="00:29:29.669" style="s2">that machines should serve us and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:31.640" style="s2">unfortunately that that isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.669" end="00:29:35.429" style="s2">very well because of this ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.640" end="00:29:37.260" style="s2">destabilization issue so bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.429" end="00:29:39.299" style="s2">back down to a kind of human context</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.260" end="00:29:40.530" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at what is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.299" end="00:29:42.150" style="s2">relationship between the end machine</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.530" end="00:29:45.000" style="s2">we&#39;re wanting to basically compensate</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.150" end="00:29:47.000" style="s2">for the biases and beings have using the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.000" end="00:29:49.169" style="s2">right level of technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.000" end="00:29:50.610" style="s2">unfortunately the level of technology is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.169" end="00:29:52.500" style="s2">currently deployed is actually way</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.610" end="00:29:55.169" style="s2">extensive way way way beyond what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.500" end="00:29:58.440" style="s2">needed in order to essentially correct</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.169" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">for the biases in human process we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.440" end="00:30:02.429" style="s2">to essentially rework the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.679" style="s2">between those so that human beings can</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.429" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">actually be in communication do the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.679" end="00:30:09.510" style="s2">sense-making so that they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:13.500" style="s2">be genuinely responsive to the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.510" end="00:30:14.730" style="s2">in a holistic way one last point that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.500" end="00:30:16.020" style="s2">would I would like to make in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.730" end="00:30:18.840" style="s2">context which is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.020" end="00:30:22.470" style="s2">important is that again for similarly</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.840" end="00:30:24.270" style="s2">evolutionary reasons we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.470" end="00:30:26.789" style="s2">about communication as being in service</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.270" end="00:30:29.010" style="s2">to our own ends to our other needs much</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.789" end="00:30:31.789" style="s2">the same way that we think of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.010" end="00:30:34.289" style="s2">as being in service to our own needs so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.789" end="00:30:35.640" style="s2">in effect if we look at you know again</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.289" end="00:30:38.070" style="s2">functions of communication from an</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:40.650" style="s2">evolutionary perspective we see it can</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.070" end="00:30:42.539" style="s2">be used for mate selection survival</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.650" end="00:30:44.760" style="s2">orientation process of one sort or</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.539" end="00:30:48.169" style="s2">another in intergenerational knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.760" end="00:30:50.580" style="s2">transfer in effect what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.169" end="00:30:52.140" style="s2">because of evolutionary process in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.580" end="00:30:54.120" style="s2">particular cultural process in the West</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.140" end="00:30:57.510" style="s2">a lot of historical reasons which I</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.120" end="00:30:59.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ve time to get into there</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.510" end="00:31:00.780" style="s2">has been this great preponderance for us</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.130" end="00:31:02.549" style="s2">to think about communication as being an</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.780" end="00:31:04.770" style="s2">individual process if if it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.549" end="00:31:09.090" style="s2">something that was to be in service to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.770" end="00:31:12.419" style="s2">one&#39;s own and one&#39;s own you know benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.090" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">basically and really if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.419" end="00:31:15.750" style="s2">work on civilization scale issues if</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:17.340" style="s2">we&#39;re going to work on existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.750" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">issues we actually need to think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.340" end="00:31:19.710" style="s2">our communication processes being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.080" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.710" end="00:31:23.669" style="s2">that larger need ie thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.830" style="s2">things from an ecosystem perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.669" end="00:31:28.049" style="s2">from a species perspective or from a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.830" end="00:31:29.399" style="s2">community perspective as a primary</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.049" end="00:31:31.500" style="s2">orientation rather than thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.399" end="00:31:33.480" style="s2">it as being for one&#39;s individual benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.500" end="00:31:37.799" style="s2">or for one&#39;s local family or for one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.480" end="00:31:39.510" style="s2">just you know immediate context so in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.799" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">other words a lot if you basically look</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.510" end="00:31:43.740" style="s2">at the internet and you just grab a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:46.309" style="s2">sample of say a million communications</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.740" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">and then you wait them on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.309" end="00:31:51.720" style="s2">is the orientation from which this the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.390" style="s2">person making the utterance the author</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.720" end="00:31:55.770" style="s2">of the statement is doing so for their</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:31:57.690" style="s2">own personal benefit or for some</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.770" end="00:31:59.700" style="s2">expected benefit in the future to accrue</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.690" end="00:32:00.990" style="s2">to them as a result of making that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.700" end="00:32:03.330" style="s2">statement you&#39;ll feel you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.990" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">the overall preponderance is in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.330" end="00:32:07.860" style="s2">that rather than speaking on behalf of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.510" style="s2">larger group or all things like that not</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.860" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">to say that that doesn&#39;t happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.510" end="00:32:14.010" style="s2">obviously you know people do take</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">altruistic actions you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.010" end="00:32:16.950" style="s2">speak up for the benefits of their</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:20.580" style="s2">community and they do speak up for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.950" end="00:32:21.620" style="s2">benefits of things like you know social</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.580" end="00:32:25.080" style="s2">welfare and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.620" end="00:32:26.909" style="s2">but that in effect we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.080" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">preponderance of behavior it&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.909" end="00:32:29.909" style="s2">on the side of the individual benefit</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.710" end="00:32:33.779" style="s2">and only occasionally on side of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.909" end="00:32:35.370" style="s2">altruistic benefit so in one sense to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.779" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">really do sense making at a community</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.370" end="00:32:38.730" style="s2">level we need to ship that balance and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">have it be a little bit more on the on</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.730" end="00:32:42.659" style="s2">the community benefit side that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:45.419" style="s2">be done with a certain amount of just</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.659" end="00:32:47.250" style="s2">you know discernment however because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.419" end="00:32:48.510" style="s2">know people that operate just all</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.250" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">touristical e can be taken advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.510" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a free rider problem there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:55.830" style="s2">lot of issues where people can extract</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:59.100" style="s2">value from that practice and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.830" end="00:33:00.450" style="s2">benefit on a personal level from from</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.100" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">essentially extracting value from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:05.399" style="s2">Commons that is created by those actions</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:06.929" style="s2">however if we if we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.399" end="00:33:08.340" style="s2">dynamics of communication well and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.929" end="00:33:10.380" style="s2">deeply enough and we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.340" end="00:33:11.880" style="s2">relationship between you know again that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.380" end="00:33:13.409" style="s2">triangle of man-machine in nature in an</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.880" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">appropriate way then it does become</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.409" end="00:33:17.520" style="s2">possible for us to compensate for those</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:19.350" style="s2">kinds of issues and this is largely what</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.520" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">has been on my mind what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.350" end="00:33:24.059" style="s2">thinking about these last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:25.529" style="s2">years so I guess with that summary I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.059" end="00:33:26.850" style="s2">leave it at that seeing as how I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.529" end="00:33:28.919" style="s2">probably consumed way too much time</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.850" end="00:33:30.059" style="s2">already and I&#39;ll just leave it open to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.919" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">questions and see what people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.059" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">interested to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">alright thanks for the nice overview I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.750" end="00:33:42.570" style="s2">just gonna say real quickly how the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:45.930" style="s2">works again we are into fielding</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.570" end="00:33:49.350" style="s2">questions in the chat box and then I</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.930" end="00:33:51.060" style="s2">will call upon you if so would you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.350" end="00:33:53.640" style="s2">you would unmute and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.060" end="00:33:55.860" style="s2">obviously this is recorded so if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.640" end="00:33:58.110" style="s2">want me to read your question just</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.860" end="00:34:02.400" style="s2">indicate it and I will write it down</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.110" end="00:34:06.510" style="s2">oh please indicate when you read it down</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.400" end="00:34:09.150" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m gonna probably start with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.510" end="00:34:11.790" style="s2">question myself yeah I loved that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.150" end="00:34:13.790" style="s2">took started with these big hairy</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.790" end="00:34:15.929" style="s2">problems and then brought them down to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.790" end="00:34:19.260" style="s2">communication is something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.929" end="00:34:20.669" style="s2">do and then moved into EGP which is your</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.260" end="00:34:24.659" style="s2">something you&#39;re currently working on</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.669" end="00:34:27.210" style="s2">and they talked a little advice I I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.659" end="00:34:28.890" style="s2">to ask you a question around the social</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.210" end="00:34:31.470" style="s2">dynamics that you mentioned earlier or</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.890" end="00:34:33.000" style="s2">power and corruption and how it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.470" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">each EP thinks to thought that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.000" end="00:34:37.290" style="s2">the question that&#39;s been on my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:39.690" style="s2">I want to ask you in the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.290" end="00:34:41.700" style="s2">we work with but also I think you&#39;d open</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.690" end="00:34:45.780" style="s2">up a lot of potential other questions as</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.700" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">well so the the desire to seek Christy</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.780" end="00:34:50.429" style="s2">Asian to seek a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:52.140" style="s2">influence over one&#39;s environments to to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.429" end="00:34:54.659" style="s2">effectively do these these are innate</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.140" end="00:34:56.130" style="s2">things I mean it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.659" end="00:34:58.740" style="s2">the intention here to say that this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.130" end="00:35:00.660" style="s2">fundamentally bad but in certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.740" end="00:35:03.150" style="s2">contexts you know it can be it can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.660" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">overextended so the the the aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.150" end="00:35:09.840" style="s2">technology effectively leverages these</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:12.090" style="s2">these sort of relative power over</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.840" end="00:35:15.300" style="s2">seeking capacities on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.090" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">individuals it makes the the wealth</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.300" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">inequality distribution much more any</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:22.830" style="s2">unequal you know fundamental metrics</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">like that and again there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.830" end="00:35:27.000" style="s2">evidence to talk about and to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.730" style="s2">these perspectives but the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.000" end="00:35:31.980" style="s2">is that if we&#39;re doing sense making we</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.730" end="00:35:34.850" style="s2">need to not have those kind of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.980" end="00:35:37.920" style="s2">drive the process so in effect there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.850" end="00:35:39.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like if we&#39;re looking at my</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.920" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">existential risk issues then rather than</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.780" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">mate selection which is a relative</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.990" style="s2">communicative basis where</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:48.809" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about things on a survival</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.990" end="00:35:50.910" style="s2">basis which is an absolute foundation so</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.809" end="00:35:53.430" style="s2">in other words to survive you only need</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.910" end="00:35:55.019" style="s2">to actually solve the problem you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.430" end="00:35:57.809" style="s2">need to be something better than the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.019" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">next guy standing next to you so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.809" end="00:36:02.250" style="s2">difference between good enough to solve</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.119" style="s2">the problem versus better than everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.250" end="00:36:08.039" style="s2">else in your particular group you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.119" end="00:36:09.420" style="s2">in order to quote-unquote win really</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.039" end="00:36:12.269" style="s2">makes a huge difference if we&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.420" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at relative relationships</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.269" end="00:36:17.970" style="s2">as the basis of what we mean by success</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:19.349" style="s2">or what we mean by win-win then that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.970" end="00:36:21.289" style="s2">that&#39;s just not actually the correct</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.349" end="00:36:24.329" style="s2">formulation of how to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.289" end="00:36:25.859" style="s2">so in in a sense when we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.329" end="00:36:28.109" style="s2">win-win solutions we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.859" end="00:36:31.049" style="s2">win-win in the sense of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.109" end="00:36:32.670" style="s2">underlying values I need the idea is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.049" end="00:36:33.960" style="s2">that values aren&#39;t something that&#39;s held</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">on the part of an individual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.960" end="00:36:37.799" style="s2">something that is held by essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.019" style="s2">collection of individuals meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.799" end="00:36:42.140" style="s2">meaningfulness itself it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.019" end="00:36:46.019" style="s2">which is a an individual action either</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.140" end="00:36:49.500" style="s2">purposes can be individual but meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.019" end="00:36:51.299" style="s2">is an interpersonal phenomenon I can you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.500" end="00:36:52.859" style="s2">know make up a word and say this word is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.299" end="00:36:54.750" style="s2">defined as that thing but unless other</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.859" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">people essentially sort of go along with</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.750" end="00:37:00.569" style="s2">that then then it doesn&#39;t become part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:03.180" style="s2">language so you know in a sense there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.569" end="00:37:05.029" style="s2">there&#39;s there is a sort of idea here</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.180" end="00:37:07.500" style="s2">that nobody owns language there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.029" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">identity structures attached to language</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.500" end="00:37:11.609" style="s2">particularly I mean there may be you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:14.099" style="s2">know some you know like the French</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.609" end="00:37:16.380" style="s2">culture for example has a lot of esteem</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.099" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">with language but fundamentally language</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.380" end="00:37:19.289" style="s2">is still a shared phenomenon as part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:23.670" style="s2">the culture rather than part of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.289" end="00:37:24.839" style="s2">particular person&#39;s identity so and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.670" end="00:37:26.940" style="s2">in that particular sense when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.839" end="00:37:29.130" style="s2">looking at you know what are the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.940" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">of dynamics that facilitate sense making</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.130" end="00:37:33.869" style="s2">we&#39;re saying okay well first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">want to have less asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.869" end="00:37:37.140" style="s2">communication process we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:39.450" style="s2">individuals to be talking to one another</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.140" end="00:37:42.059" style="s2">enough many-to-many relationship rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.450" end="00:37:43.589" style="s2">than broadcast such that you have one</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.059" end="00:37:46.230" style="s2">person speaking and lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.589" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">listening and there&#39;s not a symmetry and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.230" end="00:37:51.150" style="s2">the co relatedness the person is doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:52.289" style="s2">the broadcast very rarely gets to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.150" end="00:37:54.809" style="s2">understand the points of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.289" end="00:37:56.849" style="s2">people that he&#39;s talking to and this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.809" end="00:37:58.550" style="s2">a loss right I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.849" end="00:38:01.820" style="s2">not actually communication and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.550" end="00:38:03.230" style="s2">sense that is needed so in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.820" end="00:38:05.830" style="s2">particular sense what were what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.230" end="00:38:08.930" style="s2">really looking to do is it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.830" end="00:38:10.850" style="s2">say that you know the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.930" end="00:38:12.410" style="s2">communication patterns that people would</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.850" end="00:38:13.670" style="s2">engage with in the business world along</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.410" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">is just as simply said you need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.670" end="00:38:18.500" style="s2">create a different context and so one</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:21.140" style="s2">aspect of that is not to have broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.500" end="00:38:23.120" style="s2">but essentially to have small groups not</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.140" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">to have it you know be defined in terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.120" end="00:38:27.860" style="s2">of statement making or directive making</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:31.670" style="s2">but actually defined in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.860" end="00:38:33.470" style="s2">questions to have it be much more about</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.670" end="00:38:36.080" style="s2">perspective taking rather than about</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.470" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">agreements and so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.080" end="00:38:39.830" style="s2">of specific dynamics that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:41.270" style="s2">built into the EGP process some of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.830" end="00:38:42.740" style="s2">you know they look obvious on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.270" end="00:38:44.300" style="s2">surface but there&#39;s there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.740" end="00:38:46.340" style="s2">lot of subtlety involved in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.300" end="00:38:47.900" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.340" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">richness of thinking that has gone into</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.900" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">this and that and not just on my part is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.410" style="s2">if there&#39;s a lot of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:56.150" style="s2">collaborating on this now so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.410" end="00:38:58.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.150" end="00:39:00.500" style="s2">richness of what on the surface looks to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.490" end="00:39:02.630" style="s2">be simple practices but the emphasis is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.500" end="00:39:06.440" style="s2">not so much in terms of simplicity as it</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.630" end="00:39:08.450" style="s2">is clarity so the the clearer the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.440" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">communication process of them the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.450" end="00:39:12.950" style="s2">in which we can essentially have people</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:15.740" style="s2">really sink into one another in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.950" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">collaborative way the more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.740" end="00:39:23.050" style="s2">the emergence of solutions the big hairy</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:23.050" style="s2">audacious problems become possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.490" end="00:39:37.320" style="s2">just looking through all the questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.080" end="00:39:40.470" style="s2">right now so I would like to start off</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.320" end="00:39:45.480" style="s2">with a question from Reed can you unmute</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.470" end="00:39:48.810" style="s2">as for sure can you hear me yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.480" end="00:39:52.440" style="s2">for doing this forest so I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.810" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">you mentioned those three principles for</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.440" end="00:39:56.730" style="s2">productive sense making dialogue and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.710" style="s2">was wondering just what other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.730" end="00:40:00.510" style="s2">low-hanging fruit there might be like</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.710" end="00:40:02.940" style="s2">nonviolent communication or steel</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.510" end="00:40:05.310" style="s2">Manning or other kinds of elements that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.940" end="00:40:08.580" style="s2">we could introduce that would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.310" end="00:40:11.580" style="s2">productive oh there&#39;s a lot nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.580" end="00:40:12.570" style="s2">communication is a good start when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.580" end="00:40:14.610" style="s2">look at the nonviolent communication</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.570" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">thing I noticed that there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.610" end="00:40:20.610" style="s2">elements that I would add one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">a kind of affirmation to really</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.610" end="00:40:24.900" style="s2">basically you know connect to the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:27.270" style="s2">person to say hey there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.900" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">something really beautiful there so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.270" end="00:40:31.740" style="s2">validation piece is important and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:35.460" style="s2">the question-asking piece there really</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.740" end="00:40:38.700" style="s2">wasn&#39;t something explicitly said in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.460" end="00:40:40.260" style="s2">sort of four core elements of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.700" end="00:40:42.110" style="s2">non-violent communication that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.260" end="00:40:45.690" style="s2">allowed for inquiry to really be a thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.110" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">this and those are minor things and idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.690" end="00:40:50.630" style="s2">here is that you know those are those</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:40:53.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one slice of good practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.630" end="00:40:55.530" style="s2">another good practice is to sometimes be</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.400" end="00:40:57.870" style="s2">aware or to to really focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.530" end="00:41:01.050" style="s2">awareness around what we would have is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.870" end="00:41:07.170" style="s2">an action bias so many times people will</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.050" end="00:41:09.690" style="s2">ask how do I do something and while in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.170" end="00:41:11.220" style="s2">in in in in in the world where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:13.170" style="s2">living that&#39;s actually a very good bias</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.220" end="00:41:15.540" style="s2">to have to be able to execute and solve</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.170" end="00:41:17.240" style="s2">problems sometimes it&#39;s important for us</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.540" end="00:41:20.190" style="s2">to stand back and ask them what question</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.240" end="00:41:22.950" style="s2">what does success look like how would we</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.190" end="00:41:25.050" style="s2">recognize it okay so in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.950" end="00:41:27.030" style="s2">the what part of the question drives the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.050" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">how but if we just go directly to and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.030" end="00:41:32.670" style="s2">lose sight of the of the why question</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:35.430" style="s2">and the what question particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.670" end="00:41:37.860" style="s2">what question then then to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.430" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">we actually might be as I mentioned with</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.860" end="00:41:40.950" style="s2">the metaphor of the car we might have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:43.170" style="s2">grand car</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.950" end="00:41:45.300" style="s2">be a racecar with absolute complete</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.170" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">capabilities but but if it&#39;s solving the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:51.660" style="s2">wrong problem then it just isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:54.450" style="s2">the right thing so in effect the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.660" end="00:41:57.930" style="s2">other principle that I think has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.450" end="00:41:59.609" style="s2">mentioned I believe this one Jordans you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.930" end="00:42:00.930" style="s2">know the Omega principle ie presume that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.609" end="00:42:02.730" style="s2">the other person has something</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.930" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">worthwhile to say that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.730" end="00:42:05.820" style="s2">doing their best to to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.650" end="00:42:08.070" style="s2">something that&#39;s meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.820" end="00:42:10.829" style="s2">important I mean this is true even in an</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.070" end="00:42:13.260" style="s2">adversarial context that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.829" end="00:42:15.420" style="s2">the values that the other person has is</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.260" end="00:42:16.890" style="s2">is there&#39;s a grain of truth and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.420" end="00:42:19.050" style="s2">it is that they&#39;re valuing and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.890" end="00:42:20.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense of there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.050" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">fundamental value conflicts I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.940" end="00:42:25.650" style="s2">sometimes get into this perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:28.829" style="s2">well I value a and the social person</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.650" end="00:42:30.839" style="s2">values B but you can actually - you both</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.829" end="00:42:33.329" style="s2">a and B there&#39;s no mutual exclusivity</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.839" end="00:42:34.890" style="s2">that&#39;s required to UM you know unless</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.329" end="00:42:36.300" style="s2">people are really trying to construct it</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.890" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">that particular but that really doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.300" end="00:42:40.050" style="s2">happen that way as a as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">phenomena it happens as a constructive</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:49.470" style="s2">can co-occur so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.770" end="00:42:53.010" style="s2">sense here of you know communications</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.470" end="00:42:55.410" style="s2">hard like in any given moment the amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.010" end="00:42:57.540" style="s2">of vocal bandwidth that I have to convey</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.410" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">ideas is about 42 bits per second it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.540" end="00:43:01.500" style="s2">just not very much you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">looking at computers and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.500" end="00:43:04.740" style="s2">that is you know speaking back and forth</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.230" end="00:43:29.730" style="s2">actually lie on an unconscious process</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.579" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">quite a bit and so in effect there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.730" end="00:43:33.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a need for us to take some</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:35.849" style="s2">things for granted with the other in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.930" end="00:43:39.660" style="s2">sense of really working with them to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.849" end="00:43:41.700" style="s2">search out the meaningfulness you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.660" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">when any one person says something to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.700" end="00:43:46.290" style="s2">someone else it&#39;s very easy to do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:48.030" style="s2">stupid obvious thing to point out the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.290" end="00:43:49.230" style="s2">false parts the parts that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.030" end="00:43:51.690" style="s2">agree with the parts that don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.230" end="00:43:53.010" style="s2">sense but it really requires a much</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.690" end="00:43:54.450" style="s2">higher level of skillfulness to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.010" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">basically say okay I want to reach</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.450" end="00:43:58.349" style="s2">through the inside of all that and find</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:00.540" style="s2">out what is the grain of truth that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.349" end="00:44:02.130" style="s2">that is really genuinely important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.540" end="00:44:03.660" style="s2">genuinely insightful that really speaks</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.130" end="00:44:06.450" style="s2">to meaningfulness or values or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.660" end="00:44:09.329" style="s2">sacred and so you know when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.450" end="00:44:11.369" style="s2">give that sort of willingness to hear</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.329" end="00:44:13.260" style="s2">the inside of the message to really seek</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.369" end="00:44:16.230" style="s2">out the parts that are the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.260" end="00:44:17.880" style="s2">principles underneath it all then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.230" end="00:44:19.500" style="s2">communication process can move forward</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">and far more dynamic way than what</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.500" end="00:44:25.349" style="s2">otherwise be the case and and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:27.540" style="s2">another principle is is basically to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.349" end="00:44:29.930" style="s2">recognize when you know we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.540" end="00:44:32.099" style="s2">an adversarial conversation versus a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.930" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">mutual cooperative one I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.099" end="00:44:36.450" style="s2">times people I mean at least for myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">I mean we could we either get into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.450" end="00:44:40.859" style="s2">habit of assuming cooperation which I</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:42.390" style="s2">tend to do or we&#39;re into the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.859" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">assuming adversary on this which I know</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.390" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">some of the people do and and and again</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.869" style="s2">it&#39;s not right wrong here but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.819" style="s2">a little bit of a thing of if it&#39;s a if</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.869" end="00:44:52.349" style="s2">you&#39;re making the wrong assumption as to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.819" end="00:44:54.300" style="s2">the to the nature of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.349" end="00:44:57.180" style="s2">and then you&#39;re not communicating very</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.300" end="00:45:00.930" style="s2">well and this is basically to observe</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.180" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">that both have their place you know for</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.930" end="00:45:05.160" style="s2">if we&#39;re looking at a jury trial type of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:06.540" style="s2">situation where it&#39;s important for us to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.160" end="00:45:08.579" style="s2">cut to the right answer and people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.540" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">lives depend upon the sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.579" end="00:45:13.400" style="s2">making process that a jury trial is you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:16.170" style="s2">know you want all of the sensing</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.400" end="00:45:17.790" style="s2">capacities to to be engaged and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.170" end="00:45:20.010" style="s2">dependent yes it&#39;s an adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.790" end="00:45:21.480" style="s2">process but on the other hand you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.010" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">to really look at it with enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.480" end="00:45:24.390" style="s2">dimensions or really to identify what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:26.130" style="s2">what is the deep truth of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.390" end="00:45:28.859" style="s2">happening here&#39;s is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:30.660" style="s2">important sometimes you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.859" end="00:45:32.339" style="s2">adversarial conversation provides a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.660" end="00:45:34.619" style="s2">for the keeper values to be identified</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.339" end="00:45:36.569" style="s2">and opinion to be brought forward in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.619" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">productive way hopefully we have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.569" end="00:45:40.920" style="s2">shift from an adversarial context to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">cooperative one but if we mistake which</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.920" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">conversation were in or what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:45.540" style="s2">intentions are what matters to the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:48.450" style="s2">person because we&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.540" end="00:45:49.470" style="s2">attention or we just presume that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.450" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything interesting to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.470" end="00:45:54.839" style="s2">then then we kind of miss the point</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:57.210" style="s2">so you know in that situation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.839" end="00:45:58.980" style="s2">basically looking at you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.210" end="00:46:02.490" style="s2">different principles that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.980" end="00:46:04.100" style="s2">involve things that would enable deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.490" end="00:46:06.450" style="s2">communication to occur</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.100" end="00:46:07.950" style="s2">you know getting into the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:09.660" style="s2">exercises that allow you to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.950" end="00:46:11.580" style="s2">perspective taking on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.660" end="00:46:13.500" style="s2">other to really put yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.580" end="00:46:15.500" style="s2">shoes of the other that&#39;s a huge skill</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.500" end="00:46:17.460" style="s2">and not very many people get into that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.500" end="00:46:19.140" style="s2">but on the other hand you know if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.460" end="00:46:20.700" style="s2">there&#39;s if there&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.140" end="00:46:22.290" style="s2">want to do to essentially become a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.700" end="00:46:44.370" style="s2">better communicator that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.290" end="00:46:47.370" style="s2">a by far strong thing to do where I am</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.370" end="00:46:49.530" style="s2">but the question is essentially how do</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.370" end="00:46:51.060" style="s2">you get groups of people who do not</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.530" end="00:46:53.450" style="s2">engage when I think you might not have</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.060" end="00:46:56.330" style="s2">the opportunity to engage one another</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.450" end="00:46:57.870" style="s2">nevertheless to have more clear</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.330" end="00:46:58.940" style="s2">communication that could lead to</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.870" end="00:47:01.710" style="s2">something more generative</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.940" end="00:47:03.510" style="s2">solutions-oriented but they might not be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.710" end="00:47:07.350" style="s2">exposed to one another to begin with I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.510" end="00:47:09.300" style="s2">might not have that invite to start well</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.350" end="00:47:10.890" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.300" end="00:47:12.060" style="s2">work going on in this space I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.890" end="00:47:14.970" style="s2">that I would be adding anything original</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.060" end="00:47:16.770" style="s2">but you know to bring all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.970" end="00:47:18.360" style="s2">stakeholders into the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.770" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">to essentially help them to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.360" end="00:47:21.450" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:23.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of human development stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.450" end="00:47:25.950" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s really helpful so for</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.940" end="00:47:27.720" style="s2">example you know people are in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.950" end="00:47:28.860" style="s2">traumatized state and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.720" end="00:47:31.650" style="s2">any way of dealing with their own</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.860" end="00:47:32.550" style="s2">personal trauma then then they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.650" end="00:47:34.890" style="s2">going to have a hard time communicating</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.550" end="00:47:36.840" style="s2">at all so in effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.890" end="00:47:39.240" style="s2">sense of you know how do we increase</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.840" end="00:47:42.150" style="s2">individual health how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.240" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">help people to essentially you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.150" end="00:47:46.470" style="s2">develop the skills of socialization that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:48.450" style="s2">would essentially allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.470" end="00:47:50.760" style="s2">communicate well and deeply with one</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.450" end="00:47:52.590" style="s2">another occasionally that means just</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.760" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">meeting needs you know make making sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.590" end="00:47:57.510" style="s2">that needs are met but but in in you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:48:01.050" style="s2">know once once you get sort of passed</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.510" end="00:48:03.030" style="s2">with the rudimentary kinds of things you</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.050" end="00:48:04.860" style="s2">know creating an environment which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.030" end="00:48:06.930" style="s2">essentially conducive to this process so</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.860" end="00:48:08.370" style="s2">you might start with provisional</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.930" end="00:48:09.630" style="s2">agreements for the meeting that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.370" end="00:48:11.550" style="s2">actually happening after you&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.630" end="00:48:13.170" style="s2">the invitation you might need to give</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.550" end="00:48:15.630" style="s2">certain assurances to the people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.170" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">are coming into that context that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.630" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">are safe then that contact</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.460" end="00:48:21.570" style="s2">specific ways you might need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:23.640" style="s2">basically do things to ensure that other</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.570" end="00:48:26.339" style="s2">people don&#39;t leverage the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.640" end="00:48:28.140" style="s2">safety itself as the kind of weapon</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.339" end="00:48:30.119" style="s2">you might want to get really good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.140" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">recognizing what weaponization is you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.119" end="00:48:33.630" style="s2">know what is weaponized communication</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:37.320" style="s2">look like and how do you basically do</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.630" end="00:48:39.390" style="s2">the kinds of practices that aren&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.320" end="00:48:40.710" style="s2">that that effectively emerge from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.390" end="00:48:41.270" style="s2">so you have to recognize what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.710" end="00:48:44.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.270" end="00:48:48.150" style="s2">any anything that is essentially the use</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.520" end="00:48:49.740" style="s2">of causation to suppress choices is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.150" end="00:48:52.050" style="s2">gonna be somewhat suspect to not right</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.740" end="00:48:53.940" style="s2">in that particular way so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.050" end="00:48:55.619" style="s2">is is that you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.940" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">lot of different ingredients that all</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.619" end="00:48:58.470" style="s2">need to work together in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:48:59.960" style="s2">the context where people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.470" end="00:49:02.130" style="s2">communicating with one another</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.960" end="00:49:04.619" style="s2">fortunately the human biology provides</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.130" end="00:49:06.300" style="s2">some support for this process but you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.619" end="00:49:08.339" style="s2">know given the the technology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.300" end="00:49:10.109" style="s2">involved and so on so forth des there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.339" end="00:49:11.580" style="s2">a need for us to essentially become much</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.109" end="00:49:14.210" style="s2">more skillful about these particular</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.800" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a need for us to be far more</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.690" end="00:49:26.010" style="s2">discerning about these practices because</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:27.390" style="s2">evolution hasn&#39;t prepared us for the</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.650" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">capabilities you know power of gods and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.380" end="00:49:38.970" style="s2">all that sort of thing so so at this</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:41.760" style="s2">particular juncture just to try to sum</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.970" end="00:49:43.290" style="s2">up an answer to your question first of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:44.910" style="s2">all it&#39;s not a single thing it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.290" end="00:49:47.310" style="s2">bunch of practices that all kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.910" end="00:49:48.780" style="s2">together in concert and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.310" end="00:49:51.450" style="s2">really good work going on in this field</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.780" end="00:49:52.619" style="s2">and so all I can really do at this point</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.450" end="00:50:06.470" style="s2">is just give you there&#39;s kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.470" end="00:50:23.700" style="s2">potentially if are as I came across your</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.820" end="00:50:26.550" style="s2">quote love is that which enables choice</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.700" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">love is always stronger than fear always</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.550" end="00:50:31.170" style="s2">choose on the basis of love and I looked</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:32.940" style="s2">you up thinking your</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.170" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">like at Ernst McKenna number two and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.940" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">was surprised to see yeah so I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:40.109" style="s2">where this came from if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:43.230" style="s2">unpack that first sure well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.109" end="00:50:46.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a quote that that I put</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.230" end="00:50:50.730" style="s2">together as what is the single most</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.250" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">succinct and useful in in a life sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.730" end="00:50:57.299" style="s2">you know if I had to condense I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:58.710" style="s2">obviously I can&#39;t hold all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.299" end="00:51:00.680" style="s2">that I&#39;ve learned in life but but but if</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.710" end="00:51:04.010" style="s2">I want to pick the single most useful</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.680" end="00:51:06.540" style="s2">learning the single most useful wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.010" end="00:51:09.299" style="s2">that that was really what came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.540" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">the idea of love is that which enables</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.299" end="00:51:15.030" style="s2">choices partly a description of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:16.740" style="s2">love is like how do we know that we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.030" end="00:51:18.359" style="s2">being loving to another person what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.740" end="00:51:21.089" style="s2">the litmus test that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.359" end="00:51:23.780" style="s2">distinguish between we think we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.089" end="00:51:27.780" style="s2">loving versus we&#39;re actually being cruel</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.780" end="00:51:29.579" style="s2">or you know the other person says that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.780" end="00:51:31.500" style="s2">they love us but we&#39;re not feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.579" end="00:51:34.230" style="s2">love and and and we might want to need</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.500" end="00:51:35.670" style="s2">it or need a tool to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.230" end="00:51:37.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between what they</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.670" end="00:51:39.780" style="s2">say they&#39;re doing what we&#39;re feeling so</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.099" end="00:51:41.400" style="s2">in effect the idea behind love is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.780" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">which enables choice is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.400" end="00:51:47.430" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s not based upon the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:51.660" style="s2">of love it&#39;s based upon the action what</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.430" end="00:51:53.309" style="s2">does it mean to do it and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.660" end="00:51:55.859" style="s2">one sort of parable that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.309" end="00:51:58.680" style="s2">described to to convey this and give a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.859" end="00:52:01.770" style="s2">sense of it is that you know salmon in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.680" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">partnership with a woman and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.770" end="00:52:07.859" style="s2">I&#39;m wanting her to feel love from me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:10.710" style="s2">I was I&#39;m wanting to enable her in her</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.859" end="00:52:14.040" style="s2">life to realize her dreams to become</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.710" end="00:52:15.869" style="s2">more fully and completely herself to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.040" end="00:52:18.930" style="s2">become the best and brightest and most</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.869" end="00:52:21.299" style="s2">brilliant person she can be and in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.930" end="00:52:22.890" style="s2">process of her becoming that then I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.299" end="00:52:25.140" style="s2">know her better and I can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:28.530" style="s2">miraculous of her life in it in a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.140" end="00:52:30.030" style="s2">more felt sense and so in a way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.530" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">that I&#39;m not trying to make choices for</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.030" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">her because if I if I substitute her</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.540" style="s2">choices with mine then I don&#39;t ever get</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:38.490" style="s2">to experience who she is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.540" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">actually in relationship to her I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.490" end="00:52:41.980" style="s2">in relationship to the image of myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">that I&#39;ve put in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.980" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">so in effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:49.750" style="s2">really deep truths tied to this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:51.220" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at say child raising</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.750" end="00:52:53.740" style="s2">for example you know when they&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.220" end="00:52:54.850" style="s2">they have no capacity to choose on their</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.740" end="00:52:56.410" style="s2">own part I mean they are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.850" end="00:52:58.930" style="s2">literally completely dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.410" end="00:53:00.970" style="s2">parents and then you know they get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.930" end="00:53:04.119" style="s2">whatever adulthood is and they move out</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.970" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">or we die and at some point we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.119" end="00:53:07.240" style="s2">make any choices on their behalf and if</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re going to continue to live well</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.240" end="00:53:13.030" style="s2">in life you know to continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:17.770" style="s2">healthy human beings then we have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.030" end="00:53:21.310" style="s2">sort of transition from at t0 of making</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.770" end="00:53:23.770" style="s2">100% of our choices to you know T 100</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.310" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">and we&#39;re passing on and they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.770" end="00:53:27.070" style="s2">a hundred percent of their own choices</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s this sort of gradation</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.070" end="00:53:32.020" style="s2">between those two where in effect the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:33.609" style="s2">the intention here is not to make the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.020" end="00:53:36.040" style="s2">choices on behalf of the child forever</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.609" end="00:53:39.400" style="s2">but to teach you how to choose well and</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.040" end="00:53:41.260" style="s2">fully how to live well and fully how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.400" end="00:53:42.490" style="s2">have wisdom in his choices that it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.260" end="00:53:44.830" style="s2">be discerning about what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.490" end="00:53:45.880" style="s2">right to do and then anything less than</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.830" end="00:53:47.590" style="s2">that means that we&#39;ve effectively</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.880" end="00:53:48.850" style="s2">created a damaged human being that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.590" end="00:53:51.220" style="s2">capable of living your own lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.850" end="00:53:52.930" style="s2">complete way so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.220" end="00:53:55.150" style="s2">intergenerational knowledge transfer</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:57.700" style="s2">this intergenerational capacity is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.150" end="00:53:59.020" style="s2">hundred percent enabling it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.700" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">for the benefit of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.020" end="00:54:03.190" style="s2">generations completely for the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:05.080" style="s2">of the receiving one and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.190" end="00:54:07.750" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is is that we we</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.080" end="00:54:09.100" style="s2">recognize that that as a core idea is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.750" end="00:54:11.560" style="s2">the very meaning of what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.100" end="00:54:13.720" style="s2">love our children you know when we look</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.560" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">at say government relationship you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:18.130" style="s2">the state and the people the function of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:19.990" style="s2">our government is to protect the land</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.130" end="00:54:21.100" style="s2">and the people and that&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.990" end="00:54:22.600" style="s2">function I mean you know to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.100" end="00:54:25.390" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s a need for that but</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.600" end="00:54:27.369" style="s2">the idea here is is that if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.390" end="00:54:30.130" style="s2">go beyond that if we want to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.369" end="00:54:31.690" style="s2">land and the people that are thriving we</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.130" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">need to go beyond protection and just</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.690" end="00:54:36.070" style="s2">making people feel safe we actually want</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:38.440" style="s2">to go to the space of that the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.070" end="00:54:40.840" style="s2">ecosystem that the the holistic health</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.440" end="00:54:42.700" style="s2">and vitality of the people in the lander</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.840" end="00:54:44.410" style="s2">is increasing the ecosystem is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.700" end="00:54:47.800" style="s2">essentially a more robust more</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.410" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">meaningful space to live in and so even</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.800" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">in a sense we&#39;re seeing this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:53.560" style="s2">enables choice right so it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.060" style="s2">you know that we want a minimal</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.560" end="00:54:55.869" style="s2">government in the maximal market place</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.060" end="00:54:58.660" style="s2">because neither of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.869" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">in this cases is adequate to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.660" end="00:55:01.900" style="s2">problems were facing but we actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:03.970" style="s2">need more than that and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.900" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a recognition here</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.970" end="00:55:07.900" style="s2">that the notion of love is that which</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:08.890" style="s2">enables choice the life liberty and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.900" end="00:55:10.900" style="s2">pursuit of happiness</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.890" end="00:55:12.549" style="s2">not just at an individual level but at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.900" end="00:55:15.160" style="s2">community level at a species level and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.549" end="00:55:16.900" style="s2">an ecosystem level and that the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.160" end="00:55:19.029" style="s2">notion of meaningfulness and sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:20.499" style="s2">and so on and so forth is is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.029" end="00:55:22.980" style="s2">something that&#39;s taking it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.499" end="00:55:22.980" style="s2">that&#39;s given</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.900" end="00:55:37.319" style="s2">I think that&#39;s all I could say about</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.369" end="00:55:43.410" style="s2">that right now awesome I think that&#39;s a</p>
