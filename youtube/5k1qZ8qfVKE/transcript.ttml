<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">so much guesswork as to what the user</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.160" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">wants and needs then they make an</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:19.230" style="s2">iteration that they hope meets most of</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:34.950" style="s2">not letting you stay on the market but</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">most of the time with technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.950" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">90% of the way there to be usable but</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:43.640" style="s2">it&#39;s broken in a tiny way that breaks</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">the whole thing it meets the needs or</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.640" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">fixes the problem for 90% it fixes the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">problem 90% for some of the people but</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">that 10% isn&#39;t getting you all the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">there and so you&#39;re not getting the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">people on board and the issue is even if</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:01.940" style="s2">you have a perfect product even if the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">product you create is absolutely amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.940" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">you have no guarantee that people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">gonna find it your marketing strategy</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">might be off you might not be going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">the right people you might have a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">niche community that you&#39;ve created for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">that is life-changing for that niche but</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">how do you how do you get it to them the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">funding model can often be off where the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">funding model itself breaks the mission</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">or you can&#39;t make enough money to stay</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">afloat because you you might need the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">needs of the people but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">willing to put it to pay the price</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve set it at because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:35.790" style="s2">price you need to stay afloat it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">necessarily supply meeting demand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">not meeting your people where they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">it&#39;s just setting the price is what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">need to be able to break even because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have a market and so the funny one</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">woke me off also trust and security with</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">every new app that comes on the market</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">and then goes under in its first year</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">which is 9 out of 10 of them it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">the next ones that come on board that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really happen in the non</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">technology space if there&#39;s a new retail</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.159" style="s2">store or a new coffee shop on my block</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">and I buy something from it I might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.159" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">upset that they go out of business</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">because I liked their product but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">not going to make me not buy clothes in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">the future or not buy a coffee in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">future because I have the thing it does</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.010" style="s2">hurt me that it went out of business</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">right I can&#39;t get my favorite cup of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">coffee but I still had those cups of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:26.520" style="s2">coffee it if putting your information on</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">a app it&#39;s only gonna happen if I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.520" end="00:02:31.590" style="s2">trust that you&#39;re gonna be around in two</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">three ten years then it hurts you to not</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.590" end="00:02:35.130" style="s2">have security and Trust in it to not</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">have it be transparent that I can see</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.130" end="00:02:39.210" style="s2">why I can trust you who are you how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:41.010" style="s2">should I trust you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.210" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">those are two different options two</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.010" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">different problems trust in you as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2">person in you as a company but also just</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">faith that you&#39;re gonna be around for</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">for any amount of time one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">big issues that is risky is the market</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">itself is saturated so unless you come</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">up with a truly innovative product</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">you&#39;re all competing for the same people</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">and there&#39;s very little that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">differentiate you in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">with an app very little that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">proprietary and so all of the data and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">all of the people are spread out and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">you win a technology is generally being</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">bought up by one of the big four because</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">they have the people they have the money</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re not spread out so besides</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">between the four of them and so when</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">we&#39;re competing with them it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">risky to create technology and the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:26.850" style="s2">that come in and fail and there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">systems in place to improve them if</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">they&#39;re 90% of the way there</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:31.800" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t that extra way to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">that 10% from the users to say well I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.800" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">use it if right if this wasn&#39;t ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:38.580" style="s2">dollars a month and it was five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:41.520" style="s2">a month or it was based on ads I&#39;d use</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.580" end="00:03:43.080" style="s2">it then that there isn&#39;t a way to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.520" end="00:03:45.269" style="s2">improve it together there isn&#39;t way to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.080" end="00:03:46.860" style="s2">trust it together and every new person</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.269" end="00:03:49.350" style="s2">that comes on the market every new app</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">has to start back at square one not</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.350" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">knowing why all the ones who were in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:57.300" style="s2">that marketplace before failed so tech</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">is risky I am creating a video series</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.300" end="00:04:04.550" style="s2">that explains why a technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:08.160" style="s2">cooperative is most of the good and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.550" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">basically none of the bad and why we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.160" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">need a technology cooperative to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:13.050" style="s2">a better world</p>
