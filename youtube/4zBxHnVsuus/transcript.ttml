<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:49.410" style="s2">really interesting sandbox of playing</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.190" end="00:14:04.020" style="s2">avenues to look at change and I was a</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.020" end="00:14:08.670" style="s2">innovation district but I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.490" end="00:14:11.100" style="s2">pushing but it was so when I went from</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.670" end="00:14:12.390" style="s2">kind of like you know still large urban</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.100" end="00:14:15.240" style="s2">developments in New York I was dealing</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.390" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2">with like this huge district now and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.240" end="00:14:20.460" style="s2">scale of change and we can do around</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:22.200" style="s2">energy water placemaking you know all</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.460" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">the different elements of a city and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.200" end="00:14:27.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve been getting in the DNA of Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:29.970" style="s2">to create a really dynamic place and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.830" end="00:14:31.710" style="s2">housing you know all the innovative</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.970" end="00:14:34.230" style="s2">housing models so I spent like six years</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.710" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">there was really fruitful for me but a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.230" end="00:14:42.750" style="s2">lot of it had to do with spending time</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:44.970" style="s2">with Jonathan Rhodes who is my mentor</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.750" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">and kind of like I put him up there with</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.970" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">Chris Alexander and few other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.690" style="s2">that really profoundly influenced me in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.390" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">the way I see the world perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.690" end="00:14:54.690" style="s2">Jonathan&#39;s a developer in New York but</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">he&#39;s been the pioneer of so much</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.860" end="00:15:09.030" style="s2">dealing with climate change and we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:11.220" style="s2">founded an institute in upstate New York</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.030" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">even before I left for Seattle called</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.220" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">the garrison Institute and we had a</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.020" end="00:15:28.260" style="s2">government&#39;s not really going to deal</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.280" end="00:15:30.180" style="s2">with this we have an industry at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.260" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">store taking this on is the group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.180" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">in this room yes we believe climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.540" style="s2">change is real now we all start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">about how do we adapt our portfolios to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.540" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">address climate resilience and change in</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:46.350" style="s2">the change in climb in the future that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">morphed into a initiative called climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.350" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">in mind the behavior in looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:53.610" style="s2">neuroscience and behavioral dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:55.650" style="s2">of climate change and being a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.610" end="00:15:58.140" style="s2">little sponge in the room with all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.650" end="00:16:00.530" style="s2">brilliant neurobiologist scientists</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.140" end="00:16:02.640" style="s2">people like paul hawking were there</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.530" end="00:16:07.940" style="s2">Janine Benyus would be part of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.640" end="00:16:11.760" style="s2">events this was in like 2006 to 2009</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.940" end="00:16:14.010" style="s2">2010 and I was just reading and learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.760" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">all this stuff and one of these was this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">work by Columbia University called the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.950" style="s2">Center for research and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:21.210" style="s2">decision-making and they have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.950" end="00:16:22.530" style="s2">document they created called the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.210" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">psychology of climate change</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.530" end="00:16:28.500" style="s2">communication there&#39;s a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">accessible read but it got into thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.500" end="00:16:34.440" style="s2">about single action biases how when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">walk in tell the story create change we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.440" end="00:16:39.540" style="s2">have to speak to both hemispheres of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:41.550" style="s2">brain so the you know the analytical</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.540" end="00:16:42.870" style="s2">side but also the experiential side so</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.550" end="00:16:45.300" style="s2">you have storytelling with data</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.870" end="00:16:46.740" style="s2">storytelling with data and I started</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.300" end="00:16:49.080" style="s2">using I was like well this is really</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.740" end="00:16:51.270" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m gonna start using this</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.080" end="00:16:55.730" style="s2">as a way to do change agent work in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.270" end="00:16:57.960" style="s2">company so what was always a really</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.730" end="00:17:00.660" style="s2">really a lot of friction than doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.960" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">change agent working my companies I what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.660" end="00:17:04.650" style="s2">I started doing was getting people out</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:06.330" style="s2">of the office and my this is my</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.650" end="00:17:08.610" style="s2">technique that I learned that helped me</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.330" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2">unlock a full great a lot of potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.610" end="00:17:12.839" style="s2">around me I started taking people out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">the office into a coffee shop down the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.839" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">street one on one and I would start by</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">making myself vulnerable right you</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.850" end="00:17:22.260" style="s2">already heard me open up my story when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:24.920" style="s2">started out you know drip a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.260" end="00:17:28.170" style="s2">of my personal story into a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.920" end="00:17:30.780" style="s2">sought to identify why this stuff&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.170" end="00:17:33.240" style="s2">important to me and kind of weave in</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.780" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">some data in storytelling and then that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.240" end="00:17:36.180" style="s2">person would make themselves vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:37.970" style="s2">and they start talking about their</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.180" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">connection to the issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.970" end="00:17:40.789" style="s2">and I started to chelating a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:44.389" style="s2">for how many you know men and then all</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.789" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">of a sudden after so many coffees there</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.389" end="00:17:48.740" style="s2">was like 40 champions in the company in</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:51.320" style="s2">all the different departments that were</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.740" end="00:17:52.879" style="s2">taking on ownership repealing change</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.320" end="00:17:56.929" style="s2">engine work in their department so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.879" end="00:18:00.350" style="s2">kind of spread this kind of this model a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.929" end="00:18:02.299" style="s2">chain of the company that percolated up</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.350" end="00:18:04.039" style="s2">after a number of years to completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.299" end="00:18:05.509" style="s2">change the executive leadership in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.039" end="00:18:11.330" style="s2">mission of the organization it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.509" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">really great and around the GSC happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.330" end="00:18:18.500" style="s2">you know the global financial crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">just joined the board of cascading or</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">Building Council and we had a Living</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:25.070" style="s2">Building Challenge put out there and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.730" style="s2">hadn&#39;t started we hadn&#39;t founded the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.070" end="00:18:30.169" style="s2">International any teacher into 2010 but</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.730" end="00:18:32.570" style="s2">2010 was a really pivotal year so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.169" end="00:18:36.110" style="s2">two years leading up to 2010 2008 to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.570" end="00:18:39.799" style="s2">2010 I was tasked with looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.110" end="00:18:41.809" style="s2">global change portfolio for Paul because</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.799" end="00:18:43.519" style="s2">the global financial crisis opened up an</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.809" end="00:18:45.710" style="s2">opportunity which slowed down our work</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.519" end="00:18:48.500" style="s2">and realistic is that we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.710" end="00:18:51.169" style="s2">constrained and I my boss got permission</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.500" end="00:18:54.919" style="s2">to use motoric majority of my time we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.169" end="00:18:57.019" style="s2">look at world change stuff and all I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.919" end="00:18:59.690" style="s2">wanted to start with what Paul&#39;s passion</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.019" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">points were which were science sports</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.690" end="00:19:09.850" style="s2">art and the other one science sports</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:18.030" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember the other one don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:20.300" style="s2">forget it later but you had museums he</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.030" end="00:19:22.380" style="s2">had cultural institutions on stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.300" end="00:19:24.060" style="s2">right around the time we started they</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.380" end="00:19:26.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t mention in future suit I had the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.060" end="00:19:29.340" style="s2">idea of where I looked across the street</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.550" end="00:19:30.630" style="s2">from our office and we had the sports</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.350" end="00:19:42.420" style="s2">see what those guys do too and I started</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">talking to them about sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.420" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">initiatives and technologies and things</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:50.070" style="s2">that we can do to green the stadium up</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">and long story short we got a five</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.070" end="00:19:54.210" style="s2">million dollar investment after a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:57.060" style="s2">months of work to do massive energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.210" end="00:19:58.920" style="s2">retrofit put the megawatt of solar</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.060" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">panels on top of the venue so as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.920" end="00:20:03.450" style="s2">largest solar array in Washington State</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.630" end="00:20:06.750" style="s2">but you follow that as a platform and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.450" end="00:20:09.000" style="s2">transition mindsets and the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:11.340" style="s2">behavior of fans around sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.000" end="00:20:14.190" style="s2">and what they can take action for in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.340" end="00:20:16.140" style="s2">their own home so we started sharing</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.190" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">that stuff with the Seattle Mariners and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.140" end="00:20:20.610" style="s2">other sports teams in the region and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:22.800" style="s2">February 2010 I had the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.610" end="00:20:24.600" style="s2">convening a dialogue around how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.800" end="00:20:26.450" style="s2">look at sports as a leverage point to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.600" end="00:20:27.720" style="s2">transition society towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.450" end="00:20:30.030" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">so we hosted this first session of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.030" end="00:20:35.910" style="s2">became the green sports Alliance which</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.240" end="00:20:37.170" style="s2">is now a global nonprofit with every</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.910" end="00:20:39.870" style="s2">major league sports team in North</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.170" end="00:20:41.700" style="s2">America remember it&#39;s about a two</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.870" end="00:20:43.980" style="s2">million dollar organization with six</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.700" end="00:20:45.960" style="s2">people I sit on the executive committee</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.980" end="00:20:50.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s been like it was an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.960" end="00:20:51.630" style="s2">kind of pond the plan with the worth of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.340" end="00:20:53.820" style="s2">you an idea how do we bring this</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.630" end="00:20:56.340" style="s2">conversation just to billions of sports</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.820" end="00:20:59.100" style="s2">fans and how do we use iconic sports</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.340" end="00:21:01.650" style="s2">figures like Messi and Ronaldo to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.100" end="00:21:03.630" style="s2">communicate sophisticated ways that kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.650" end="00:21:05.460" style="s2">of shift society in a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.630" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">directory trajectory we&#39;re still working</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.460" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">on that platform and if it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:12.870" style="s2">celebrating 10 years next year we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.310" style="s2">our conference in Minnesota so that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.870" end="00:21:17.640" style="s2">one really interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.310" end="00:21:19.140" style="s2">trajectory and I started it with like</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.640" end="00:21:20.760" style="s2">two other people wants another really</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.140" end="00:21:22.350" style="s2">important person from a natural resource</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.350" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">I found</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.420" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">did the board shared it and I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:29.300" style="s2">handed it over to my buddy Scott he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">one of the directors of the Mariners and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.300" end="00:21:33.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a really amazing being a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:36.050" style="s2">quintessential leader of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.710" end="00:21:37.550" style="s2">in sport and just kind of let it go you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.050" end="00:21:39.980" style="s2">know it&#39;s got to sit back on the board</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.550" end="00:21:42.920" style="s2">but then let it grow the way it needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.980" end="00:21:44.270" style="s2">to grow within that industry and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.920" end="00:21:45.710" style="s2">same thing was happening with living</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.270" end="00:21:47.450" style="s2">future Institute and we were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.710" end="00:21:49.700" style="s2">really expanding our mission living</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.450" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">buildings around the world and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:53.330" style="s2">lot of synergy with the growth that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:55.490" style="s2">saw with Sports Center and today what</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.330" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing what kind of communities</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.490" end="00:21:58.340" style="s2">take home this deeper level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:02.090" style="s2">understanding about sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.340" end="00:22:05.180" style="s2">buildings and technologies so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.090" end="00:22:08.450" style="s2">Seattle was a really amazing six years</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.180" end="00:22:10.280" style="s2">from when I probably you know I got</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.450" end="00:22:13.180" style="s2">offered to take on an even bigger role</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.280" end="00:22:16.520" style="s2">but then I decided to come to Australia</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.180" end="00:22:20.810" style="s2">challenge I&#39;ll trick it that decision</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.520" end="00:22:23.870" style="s2">like I wanted to raise my kids out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.810" end="00:22:27.740" style="s2">the u.s. you know I just feel like from</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.870" end="00:22:29.810" style="s2">it from the age of ten I had this this</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.740" end="00:22:32.090" style="s2">underlying frustration with America and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.810" end="00:22:35.380" style="s2">I&#39;m like maybe I was anachronistic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.090" end="00:22:37.970" style="s2">thinking America was great</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.380" end="00:22:42.470" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m an old soul I just saw</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.970" end="00:22:46.040" style="s2">something in America that had lost its</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.470" end="00:22:48.200" style="s2">way right it just sits and so the ego</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.040" end="00:22:50.690" style="s2">the collective arrogance of America and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.200" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">the ego of American and I humanizing at</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.690" end="00:22:55.960" style="s2">the potential rise of America and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">very insular it&#39;s very navel gazing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.960" end="00:23:01.490" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t want I&#39;m well I have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:03.290" style="s2">you know great grateful grateful</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.490" end="00:23:05.060" style="s2">grateful that I have the opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.290" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">to live overseas a bit when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.060" end="00:23:10.040" style="s2">teenager when I was a troubled youth I</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:12.380" style="s2">had teachers I got scholarships for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.040" end="00:23:15.860" style="s2">and put me in Barcelona at first like</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.380" end="00:23:18.680" style="s2">four months and it was like whoa I love</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.860" end="00:23:19.970" style="s2">this like I love learning being a scene</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.680" end="00:23:24.920" style="s2">and learning another culture and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.970" end="00:23:27.890" style="s2">language to live and I became a kid I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.920" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">became addicted to that okay I knew how</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.890" end="00:23:31.310" style="s2">important it was to develop a level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">tolerance and more cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.310" end="00:23:35.420" style="s2">countries and live in and kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">develop a more worldly view and it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.420" end="00:23:37.370" style="s2">be mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">so it was really important</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.370" end="00:23:42.650" style="s2">my kids were raised a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:46.910" style="s2">different one I think it was so</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.650" end="00:23:48.650" style="s2">important like I I&#39;ve been to 35</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.910" end="00:23:51.080" style="s2">countries on five continents by the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.650" end="00:23:53.150" style="s2">I was 29 I was also a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.080" end="00:23:56.270" style="s2">addicted to kind of seeing new places</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.150" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">and new cultures and it shapes you in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.270" end="00:24:01.550" style="s2">but it also makes you understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:03.170" style="s2">and there are different ways of being in</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.550" end="00:24:06.050" style="s2">different ways of seeing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.170" end="00:24:08.059" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take that much more than when</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.050" end="00:24:09.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen that to understand that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.059" end="00:24:11.660" style="s2">just your perspective can only be</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.920" end="00:24:13.700" style="s2">limited because there&#39;s so many others</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.660" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">and I thought oh the other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.700" end="00:24:20.600" style="s2">that&#39;s like Mary can just get that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">there&#39;s so many great things about</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.600" end="00:24:25.460" style="s2">American American has so many different</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:27.920" style="s2">personalities a book at six Americas</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.460" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">it&#39;s really good but I just you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.920" end="00:24:32.360" style="s2">wanted them and I&#39;m lucky that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:33.890" style="s2">wonderful wonderful partner in my wife</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.360" end="00:24:35.690" style="s2">Jennifer but it was you got the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.890" end="00:24:38.450" style="s2">adventurous soul is an idea it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.690" end="00:24:40.460" style="s2">you know we I took an opportunity and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.450" end="00:24:42.230" style="s2">gamble to come down here and work for an</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.460" end="00:24:45.470" style="s2">international development organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.230" end="00:24:48.590" style="s2">where I saw you know I felt I felt</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.470" end="00:24:49.730" style="s2">suffocated in Seattle where I work</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.590" end="00:24:51.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to do anything outside of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.730" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">Seattle I saw all these other poverty</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.500" end="00:24:54.380" style="s2">things happening across the world I</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">won&#39;t play into there and there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.380" end="00:24:59.059" style="s2">there and the idea was that if I worked</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.000" style="s2">for a global company I could take what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.059" end="00:25:04.130" style="s2">was doing in Seattle expand it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.000" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">internationally that wasn&#39;t the case</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.130" end="00:25:09.730" style="s2">though I&#39;m very tough doing it in a</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.730" end="00:25:14.990" style="s2">but six years I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.309" end="00:25:16.520" style="s2">been on the same trajectory that I had</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.990" end="00:25:18.920" style="s2">in Seattle the impact I had with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.520" end="00:25:20.510" style="s2">government and climate movement white</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.920" end="00:25:22.730" style="s2">house stuff we were doing on climate</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.510" end="00:25:24.950" style="s2">change policy it just didn&#39;t couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.730" end="00:25:26.420" style="s2">connect with the company that was you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.950" end="00:25:32.540" style="s2">know I was kind of stuck in this little</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.420" end="00:25:34.010" style="s2">role but what grounds me and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.540" end="00:25:35.780" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat frustrating when I moved</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:37.880" style="s2">down here I felt like I stepped back 10</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.780" end="00:25:39.500" style="s2">years instant in time with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.880" end="00:25:41.720" style="s2">sustainability but the stuff they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.500" end="00:25:44.500" style="s2">thinking through now there&#39;s stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.720" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">we did in the early 2000s or late 2010</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.500" end="00:25:48.230" style="s2">with policy around climate resilience</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.230" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">energy efficiency all this stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.299" end="00:25:56.989" style="s2">that&#39;s still taking hold now here and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.249" style="s2">probably thirty years ago a lot the</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.510" end="00:32:50.070" style="s2">the world and absorbing this this way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.660" end="00:32:52.620" style="s2">thinking about the world from her</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.070" end="00:32:53.790" style="s2">generative perspective I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.620" end="00:32:56.070" style="s2">connect with there was a white person</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.790" end="00:32:58.800" style="s2">more than anyone else has to pass and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.070" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">she cried in my arms for like that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.800" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">cried because I saw how this really</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.980" end="00:33:07.110" style="s2">powerful moment they may have been like</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:08.970" style="s2">best friends for like three years like</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.110" end="00:33:10.500" style="s2">I&#39;m mentoring or her am agender</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.970" end="00:33:12.810" style="s2">development she&#39;s been mentoring me in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.500" end="00:33:15.180" style="s2">Aboriginal knowledge but you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.810" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">to earn the right to accrue that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.180" end="00:33:20.220" style="s2">knowledge and in that world so after two</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:22.290" style="s2">years now I&#39;m invited up now to meet the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.220" end="00:33:24.540" style="s2">elders and see different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.290" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">country and learn different practices</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.540" end="00:33:30.330" style="s2">and knowledge and she&#39;s always helping</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:32.400" style="s2">me understand how what she&#39;s learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.330" end="00:33:35.700" style="s2">from her ancestors and her parents and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.400" end="00:33:37.920" style="s2">how she was raised aligns with biophilia</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.700" end="00:33:39.270" style="s2">and biomimicry and regenerative practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.920" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">and we call it that because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.270" end="00:33:45.000" style="s2">Western construct that we had to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.260" end="00:33:47.300" style="s2">so we&#39;ve developed this platform called</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.000" end="00:33:51.510" style="s2">cultural reciprocity right so it merges</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.300" end="00:33:53.550" style="s2">my journey with her journey and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.510" end="00:33:55.410" style="s2">knowledge fusion of Western science</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.550" end="00:33:57.540" style="s2">Aboriginal knowledge systems and</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.540" end="00:34:04.740" style="s2">community making so we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.750" end="00:34:06.630" style="s2">build bridge between cultures and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.740" end="00:34:08.490" style="s2">over the summer we&#39;re planning to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.630" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">a school called the gun banger school</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.490" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">for life center design so she&#39;s a Kim</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:15.330" style="s2">banger nation she&#39;s like a banging woman</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.030" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">and her background is you know super</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.330" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">intact knowledge transfer from her</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">lineage going back thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:23.909" style="s2">for totem is this is a see her people</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.179" style="s2">show them as the ocean so they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.909" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">marine focused so she&#39;s a systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.179" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">ecologist and a marine biologist and an</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:36.600" style="s2">Aboriginal ecologist so she is a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:38.010" style="s2">blend of these different worldviews so</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.600" end="00:34:38.450" style="s2">she&#39;s got the storytelling and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.010" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.450" end="00:34:44.599" style="s2">the data is really horrible they like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">had this moment and what you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.599" end="00:34:50.030" style="s2">sharing is really touching me because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">think one of the most beautiful moments</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.030" end="00:34:57.260" style="s2">for me this year has been on the last</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:34:58.460" style="s2">day of the meeting where we met in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.260" end="00:35:02.570" style="s2">Commonwealth Secretariat</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.460" end="00:35:04.250" style="s2">and back at the hotel I somehow got into</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.570" end="00:35:08.839" style="s2">a conversation with Johnny Freelander</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.250" end="00:35:12.410" style="s2">from from New Zealand and and we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.839" end="00:35:14.270" style="s2">this brief mind melt where where we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.410" end="00:35:17.930" style="s2">this open like I had this opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.270" end="00:35:20.630" style="s2">just test out some of the key frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.930" end="00:35:22.579" style="s2">that inform my way of thinking in my my</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.630" end="00:35:25.550" style="s2">practice and then he would immediately</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.579" end="00:35:28.810" style="s2">sort of pick it up and say yes in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.550" end="00:35:33.109" style="s2">people understand this in the dislike</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.810" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">but like he would create the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.109" end="00:35:39.410" style="s2">piece of what my Western mind framework</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">in terms of scale inking design and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.410" end="00:35:44.119" style="s2">nested wholeness and and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:45.530" style="s2">interconnectedness or or this this hunch</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.119" end="00:35:47.930" style="s2">that there&#39;s something wrong with our</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.530" end="00:35:50.300" style="s2">understanding of time that that the past</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.930" end="00:35:52.520" style="s2">the future and the present I actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.300" end="00:35:54.440" style="s2">co-present and that the only place where</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.520" end="00:35:57.050" style="s2">you can ever do anything is in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.440" end="00:35:59.300" style="s2">moment now but it is connected in both</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.050" end="00:36:01.400" style="s2">ways to the past and the future and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">that we re patterning the future in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.400" end="00:36:05.990" style="s2">present and so I would come up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">these frame like share these frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.990" end="00:36:10.520" style="s2">with him and then he would mirror them</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:14.980" style="s2">back to me from deep Maori knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.520" end="00:36:18.410" style="s2">and I never felt so corroborated</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.980" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">something like probably in a limited</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.410" end="00:36:24.410" style="s2">understanding but that I would East was</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.060" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">some half of understanding so I&#39;m amazed</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.410" end="00:36:30.680" style="s2">with how decolonizing our minds right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:32.540" style="s2">there&#39;s this process of unlearning made</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.680" end="00:36:34.460" style="s2">we were educating and grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.540" end="00:36:39.079" style="s2">Western context and ideology</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.460" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">epistemology that at 44 years old</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.079" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">I&#39;m unlearning more in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:46.790" style="s2">years and I have in my previous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:50.869" style="s2">like it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.790" end="00:36:51.670" style="s2">very powerful platform though if over</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.869" end="00:36:54.490" style="s2">the summer which</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.670" end="00:36:57.670" style="s2">to create this online school around life</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.490" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">center design that few Jesus indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.670" end="00:37:02.049" style="s2">knowledge and Western thinking but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">would be pairing up like you with Johnny</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.049" end="00:37:07.960" style="s2">and having a non online you know an hour</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:10.390" style="s2">discussion between how you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.960" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">this and you know I&#39;m a giant on our</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.390" end="00:37:14.770" style="s2">perspective and then tapping into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">marine side of that but William the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.770" end="00:37:19.410" style="s2">food&#39;s just a whole different way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:23.140" style="s2">tell the story with two different</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.410" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">worldviews tell it then that&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.140" end="00:37:26.290" style="s2">important but I mean he said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:30.670" style="s2">that you were a bridge builder and back</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.290" end="00:37:32.530" style="s2">in that world can the green world in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.670" end="00:37:35.500" style="s2">construction world and but this bridge</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.530" end="00:37:39.670" style="s2">building off of deep-rooted indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.500" end="00:37:43.000" style="s2">knowledge into the the Western world in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.670" end="00:37:45.730" style="s2">a in a meeting each other at a height or</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.000" end="00:37:50.200" style="s2">even in even getting arrogant Westerners</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.730" end="00:37:53.380" style="s2">to connect with humility to a point to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.200" end="00:37:56.170" style="s2">understand that what we&#39;ve lost in our</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.380" end="00:38:00.339" style="s2">obsession with technology and science</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.170" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">and the kind of where systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.339" end="00:38:08.230" style="s2">as Johnny calls it we we disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:11.230" style="s2">with the knowledge of how to live in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.230" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">place over ten thousand years in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.230" end="00:38:18.339" style="s2">that we are godless that we are keystone</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:21.309" style="s2">species that help that place flourish</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.339" end="00:38:25.480" style="s2">and unfold its potential as part of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.309" end="00:38:28.180" style="s2">place and we call that wisdom primitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.480" end="00:38:30.220" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m hearing that what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.180" end="00:38:32.319" style="s2">what you&#39;re building I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.220" end="00:38:35.079" style="s2">the most important bridge that we need</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.319" end="00:38:37.809" style="s2">to build to reconnect a great but</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:16.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve only been in contact by</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.560" end="00:40:18.930" style="s2">email a couple of times so like Jason</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.470" end="00:40:21.540" style="s2">and I just dove into this as a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:24.510" style="s2">interview that I&#39;m hoping to share as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.540" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">blog and so I hope you&#39;re okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.510" end="00:40:32.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s great maybe maybe now that</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.520" end="00:40:39.300" style="s2">brief opportunity to share a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">how you have been working with</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.300" end="00:40:44.460" style="s2">regeneration in Australia and and help</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:46.910" style="s2">to kind of what Jason just said helped</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.460" end="00:40:49.740" style="s2">to kind of create the foundations for</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.910" end="00:40:52.530" style="s2">Australia New Zealand seems seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.740" end="00:40:58.410" style="s2">the hub of regeneration at the moment on</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.530" end="00:40:59.490" style="s2">the planet yeah so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.410" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">actually respond to your previous</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.490" end="00:41:02.850" style="s2">conversation so I&#39;ve been listening in</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.730" style="s2">for about 10 minutes I was trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.850" end="00:41:07.110" style="s2">my technology going this um as Jason</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.730" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">knows I&#39;ve been working on this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.110" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">modern custodianship which isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:15.330" style="s2">about respecting their past knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:17.370" style="s2">you know their past knowledge which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.330" end="00:41:17.970" style="s2">still current so it&#39;s difficult one</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.370" end="00:41:20.760" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.970" end="00:41:22.790" style="s2">their knowledge but to also say well</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.760" end="00:41:26.460" style="s2">when that knowledge is applied to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.790" end="00:41:30.780" style="s2">current issues here is the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.460" end="00:41:32.569" style="s2">that is occurring so Jason and I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.780" end="00:41:35.190" style="s2">got a colleague who&#39;s looking at</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.569" end="00:41:37.470" style="s2">artificial intelligence so what if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.190" end="00:41:43.609" style="s2">designed the algorithm into the bangle</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.470" end="00:41:45.869" style="s2">area in a indigenous circular expense</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.609" end="00:41:47.819" style="s2">what was the difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.869" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">how would the world look differently and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.819" end="00:41:52.200" style="s2">and so there&#39;s some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">stuff in that yes and conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.200" end="00:41:59.160" style="s2">between indigenous wisdom and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:00.750" style="s2">and thinking and being and the current</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.160" end="00:42:02.550" style="s2">issues and thinking and being and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.750" end="00:42:04.290" style="s2">not about religion either it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.550" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">about coming together and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.290" end="00:42:08.670" style="s2">emerges so that sort of I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:12.900" style="s2">interested in supporting however that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.670" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">emerges in the world as for my role in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.900" end="00:42:19.260" style="s2">regenerative development in this part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:21.180" style="s2">the world I see myself as mycelium so</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.260" end="00:42:23.700" style="s2">something that&#39;s become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.180" end="00:42:26.460" style="s2">apparent to me is that I&#39;m not really a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.700" end="00:42:31.109" style="s2">front person what I like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.460" end="00:42:32.490" style="s2">connect people pass on messages hear</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.109" end="00:42:33.960" style="s2">what people are saying see their</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.490" end="00:42:35.730" style="s2">potential and then connect them into</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.960" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">system where that potential can</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.730" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:41.220" style="s2">I think Jason you know you&#39;ve seen me</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">work and I think that&#39;s where I&#39;m at my</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.220" end="00:42:49.530" style="s2">best and and so you know Daniel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">why you know we&#39;re seeing everything</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.530" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">happening out of Europe I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:55.710" style="s2">sure you were connected into it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:59.940" style="s2">glad that you were but it&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.710" end="00:43:01.589" style="s2">kind of my space I remember mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.940" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">maybe of the regenerative development</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.589" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">network or I will it seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:13.349" style="s2">really really grown a lot stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:16.290" style="s2">and so it gained its own momentum which</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.349" end="00:43:18.270" style="s2">is wonderful and and have you managed</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.290" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2">both in Australia New Zealand to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.270" end="00:43:22.589" style="s2">cultivate ongoing connections between</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:24.210" style="s2">the people who have gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.589" end="00:43:26.520" style="s2">regenerative practitioner training and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.210" end="00:43:29.220" style="s2">and have that shared background in those</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.520" end="00:43:31.450" style="s2">shared frameworks or</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.220" end="00:43:35.620" style="s2">after the course of people just go on</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.450" end="00:43:37.360" style="s2">and try to work on how to make those</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.620" end="00:43:45.160" style="s2">frameworks actually work in their daily</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.360" end="00:43:46.630" style="s2">practice alone but yeah so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.160" end="00:43:49.390" style="s2">bunch of us that are all still connected</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.630" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">and support each other there are a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.390" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">of people that have added it to their</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">food they are in the world so for me the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.790" end="00:44:04.780" style="s2">the TRP the Regenesis work came together</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:07.030" style="s2">with the Colorado lenses works came</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.780" end="00:44:10.660" style="s2">together with my placemaking work came</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.030" end="00:44:12.520" style="s2">together with you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.660" end="00:44:14.860" style="s2">trying to build capacity in the world be</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.520" end="00:44:18.790" style="s2">contributed but all of those things came</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.860" end="00:44:21.910" style="s2">together and so it isn&#39;t about purity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.790" end="00:44:24.070" style="s2">one idea it&#39;s about taking from that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.910" end="00:44:25.870" style="s2">what supports me in my practice and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.070" end="00:44:28.150" style="s2">makes me feel like I&#39;m contributing but</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.870" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">I would say Jason and you might be able</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.150" end="00:44:34.090" style="s2">to add to this as well that we&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">all connected in as much as we can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.090" end="00:44:42.580" style="s2">but then also you know Jason&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.700" end="00:44:44.350" style="s2">amazing work with chills and and working</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.580" end="00:44:47.710" style="s2">at that big end of town and actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.350" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">cutting through because of his wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.710" end="00:44:55.480" style="s2">accent and experience in America people</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:45:00.610" style="s2">said happen listen I wish I hadn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.480" end="00:45:03.700" style="s2">lost my are you so your original that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.610" end="00:45:06.550" style="s2">Dominic I didn&#39;t know that yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.700" end="00:45:09.880" style="s2">I&#39;m Dutch but I grew up in Brazil and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.550" end="00:45:11.560" style="s2">South Africa so I have another we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.880" end="00:45:13.720" style="s2">talking earlier about how important it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.560" end="00:45:15.490" style="s2">actually is to have experience lived</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.720" end="00:45:21.550" style="s2">experience of different cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.490" end="00:45:25.330" style="s2">contexts yet again the corroboration of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:27.220" style="s2">that indeed indeed</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.330" end="00:45:30.280" style="s2">and I think the other critical thing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.220" end="00:45:32.680" style="s2">to have that last moment where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.280" end="00:45:36.700" style="s2">the initiation ceremony of building from</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.680" end="00:45:40.630" style="s2">our child into an adult where you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.700" end="00:45:42.390" style="s2">realize that you you make a choice you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.630" end="00:45:44.579" style="s2">know you make a choice to become a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.390" end="00:45:47.640" style="s2">contributing part of the system I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.579" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">that&#39;s another really important aspect I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.640" end="00:45:51.569" style="s2">think he&#39;s speaking to something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:58.349" style="s2">because Jason also shared his personal</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.569" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">story earlier that this the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.349" end="00:46:03.299" style="s2">the world is in such a mess is partially</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:05.849" style="s2">to do with the fact that we are being</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.299" end="00:46:09.000" style="s2">governed by uninitiated teenagers no</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.849" end="00:46:10.829" style="s2">matter what age they are and and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.000" end="00:46:14.490" style="s2">that&#39;s really one of the big connections</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.829" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">to First Nations or indigenous cultures</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.490" end="00:46:23.369" style="s2">is that that moment in life where as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:26.700" style="s2">teenager you invited into a capacity it</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.369" end="00:46:29.039" style="s2">makes you cross that threshold into</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.700" end="00:46:32.039" style="s2">mature membership in your community and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.039" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">of course understanding community not</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.039" end="00:46:35.609" style="s2">just as the human community but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.789" style="s2">wider community of life that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.609" end="00:46:42.089" style="s2">really what&#39;s so fundamentally missing</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.789" end="00:46:47.240" style="s2">in our culture and what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.089" end="00:46:51.329" style="s2">it just is that that the current climate</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.240" end="00:46:53.190" style="s2">crisis and the unraveling of ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.329" end="00:46:56.970" style="s2">that the cascading ecosystems collapse</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.190" end="00:46:59.779" style="s2">around the world is somehow creating</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.970" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">conditions that at species level and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.779" end="00:47:06.509" style="s2">that are similar to a rite of passage</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:10.410" style="s2">because it is making us face death at</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.509" end="00:47:14.460" style="s2">the higher level and that is making us</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.410" end="00:47:16.380" style="s2">reflect on why are we here what&#39;s why is</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.460" end="00:47:18.180" style="s2">this worth it and what is our role and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.380" end="00:47:22.950" style="s2">who are we obliged to all the questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.180" end="00:47:26.069" style="s2">that rite of passage rituals kind of yep</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.950" end="00:47:28.710" style="s2">parking people and in my big hope and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.069" end="00:47:30.750" style="s2">actually my only hope is that we will</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.710" end="00:47:33.210" style="s2">get that shift of personal development</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.750" end="00:47:36.630" style="s2">consciousness shift through this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.210" end="00:47:42.329" style="s2">and and mature quickly actually become</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.630" end="00:47:43.829" style="s2">healers and and avoid civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.329" end="00:47:47.130" style="s2">collapse that now so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.829" end="00:47:49.740" style="s2">speaking about and at the same time also</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.130" end="00:47:53.700" style="s2">gain the maturity in that process that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.740" end="00:47:55.380" style="s2">we aren&#39;t quite and so going on anymore</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.700" end="00:47:59.430" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s a part of it to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.380" end="00:48:01.319" style="s2">be able to let go to your own like like</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.430" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">to embrace your own mortality and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.319" end="00:48:05.940" style="s2">things are fine a finite and then live</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:08.099" style="s2">from from a place that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.940" end="00:48:10.290" style="s2">about really connecting in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.099" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">and and caring for the relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.290" end="00:48:16.740" style="s2">we can have while were here so and jump</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:20.150" style="s2">in anytime</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.740" end="00:48:23.670" style="s2">um have you spoken to Charles Eisenstein</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.150" end="00:48:26.819" style="s2">well I have no chance for for a few</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.670" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">years but I we&#39;ve never really had very</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.819" end="00:48:33.020" style="s2">deep one-on-one conversations yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:35.849" style="s2">because this this this discussion around</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.020" end="00:48:37.980" style="s2">you know the maturation process and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.849" end="00:48:40.230" style="s2">initiation ceremony and the permission</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.980" end="00:48:42.770" style="s2">to become an adult and contribute as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.230" end="00:48:45.150" style="s2">adult it&#39;s very much around his thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.770" end="00:48:48.599" style="s2">that comes from that because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.150" end="00:48:51.569" style="s2">shared mentor and he he&#39;s very closely</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.599" end="00:48:53.250" style="s2">linked with Gigi Coyle and from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.569" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">school of lost borders in in California</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.250" end="00:48:58.500" style="s2">and and that&#39;s where I got that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:01.049" style="s2">understanding from having done my Vision</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.500" end="00:49:03.180" style="s2">Quest with them and Gigi and has been</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.049" end="00:49:04.980" style="s2">mentoring Charles a lot Charles the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.180" end="00:49:08.940" style="s2">thing that I have a bit of a pipes for</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.980" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">Charles about this that he mm doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.940" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">honor lineage very much in terms of his</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">communications I think like I think he</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:18.450" style="s2">believes that ideas come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.319" end="00:49:22.470" style="s2">collective consciousness so there</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.450" end="00:49:26.730" style="s2">everyone&#39;s fine I can I can underwrite</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.470" end="00:49:28.829" style="s2">that but at the same time um naming your</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.730" end="00:49:30.299" style="s2">mentors are naming your elders and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.829" end="00:49:34.470" style="s2">naming your sources helps other people</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.299" end="00:49:38.220" style="s2">to find those streams up to travel</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.470" end="00:49:42.329" style="s2">upstream and that and in an honest and a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.220" end="00:49:45.390" style="s2">donor&#39;s they get to you as a learning um</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.329" end="00:49:48.390" style="s2">yeah so that was my first source</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.390" end="00:49:51.180" style="s2">my second thought is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.390" end="00:49:55.049" style="s2">necessarily believe that our First</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.180" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">Nations people had it completely right</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.049" end="00:50:03.720" style="s2">because they were still fragile right</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">wake time mean and and disrupt to this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.720" end="00:50:10.890" style="s2">system so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:13.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s as much for them to learn us</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.890" end="00:50:17.430" style="s2">for us to learn and then move together</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.730" end="00:50:21.150" style="s2">is really how I how I see things</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.430" end="00:50:23.130" style="s2">yes they had connection to place yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.150" end="00:50:25.770" style="s2">they had those initiations theremin s I</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.130" end="00:50:27.420" style="s2">had respect they were part of as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.770" end="00:50:30.360" style="s2">said the garden and tending the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.420" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">but they were still fragile and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.360" end="00:50:35.880" style="s2">particularly within the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.950" style="s2">in the world at the moment we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.880" end="00:50:40.830" style="s2">find a different solution or in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.950" end="00:50:44.190" style="s2">different way together that uses that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.830" end="00:50:46.320" style="s2">past wisdom current knowledge and our</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.190" end="00:50:48.840" style="s2">current situation and context to move</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.320" end="00:50:49.860" style="s2">forward and so that&#39;s why I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.840" end="00:50:51.869" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.860" end="00:50:54.510" style="s2">privilege in either system you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.869" end="00:50:55.830" style="s2">there&#39;s Eastern Western and indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.510" end="00:50:58.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.830" end="00:51:00.930" style="s2">ways but it&#39;s about yes and conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.190" end="00:51:03.210" style="s2">and then difficult because there is so</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.930" end="00:51:07.020" style="s2">much history the framing that I like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.210" end="00:51:08.250" style="s2">lot I like with regard to this is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.020" end="00:51:10.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever come across</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.250" end="00:51:14.670" style="s2">the small little book by own Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.440" end="00:51:16.350" style="s2">cults em saving appearances and in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.670" end="00:51:18.810" style="s2">book he makes the point that like he</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.350" end="00:51:20.940" style="s2">speaks of original participation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.810" end="00:51:23.609" style="s2">then the separation of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.940" end="00:51:26.760" style="s2">and the kind of disappearing into our</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.609" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">mind and Science and Technology and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.760" end="00:51:31.260" style="s2">he speaks the final participation as the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:34.380" style="s2">coming together of those those two so it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.260" end="00:51:36.150" style="s2">is a movement forward and that recovers</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.380" end="00:51:38.540" style="s2">the wisdom of the past but but he</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.150" end="00:51:43.260" style="s2">combines it with with the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.540" end="00:51:45.960" style="s2">science and technology as well so I I</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.260" end="00:51:48.930" style="s2">think did you mention that that book and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.960" end="00:51:50.820" style="s2">author again and oh in Barfield saving</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.930" end="00:51:52.859" style="s2">appearances he&#39;s he was not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.820" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">university scholar who has been very</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.859" end="00:51:58.619" style="s2">influential in the anthroposophical</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:52:00.600" style="s2">world is kind of part of that well but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.619" end="00:52:02.310" style="s2">would just just briefly going back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.600" end="00:52:06.930" style="s2">something you said earlier with a I am</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.310" end="00:52:08.850" style="s2">and bringing indigenous ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.930" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">together with those kind of technologies</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.850" end="00:52:13.340" style="s2">I I do sometimes wonder whether part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.340" end="00:52:20.930" style="s2">the wisdom of indigenous cultures is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:24.230" style="s2">also choose wisely what technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.930" end="00:52:27.770" style="s2">actually worth using like like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.230" end="00:52:30.230" style="s2">like we have a tendency to use</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">technology because we can like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.230" end="00:52:33.590" style="s2">comes up with oh we could create this</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.940" end="00:52:36.320" style="s2">technology and then somebody I saw we</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:37.970" style="s2">could use it for that and and mainly</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.320" end="00:52:40.430" style="s2">most of our technologies have really</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.970" end="00:52:41.660" style="s2">been developed within a context of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.430" end="00:52:45.020" style="s2">trying to kill each other and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.660" end="00:52:48.790" style="s2">military development complex but I am</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.020" end="00:52:53.930" style="s2">concerned that we we end up using</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.790" end="00:52:55.850" style="s2">technology too much and like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.930" end="00:52:58.100" style="s2">bits and bytes type of technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.850" end="00:53:01.790" style="s2">instead of coming back to the social</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.100" end="00:53:03.380" style="s2">technologies that the that we could live</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.790" end="00:53:07.340" style="s2">a much richer and more meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.380" end="00:53:13.640" style="s2">with with with less technology in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.340" end="00:53:15.590" style="s2">lives what do you think about yeah I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.640" end="00:53:17.990" style="s2">big fan of less technology I was on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.590" end="00:53:20.030" style="s2">panel with for the World Wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.990" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">Foundation few months ago and I was with</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.030" end="00:53:24.950" style="s2">me and like Schneider Electric and all</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">these digital people they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.950" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">smart homes of the future and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:28.670" style="s2">technology is going to make our lives so</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:33.010" style="s2">much better</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.670" end="00:53:35.390" style="s2">I was the diversion voice on the panel</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.010" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">like my kids are on their phone all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.390" end="00:53:40.460" style="s2">time we&#39;re trying to deal with new like</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.910" end="00:53:53.090" style="s2">everything&#39;s on here so there is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.170" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">needs to be a cautious waving before</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.090" end="00:53:57.530" style="s2">with the application and adopting a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.770" end="00:54:00.470" style="s2">technology you know Nicole and I&#39;m a big</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.530" end="00:54:02.450" style="s2">fan of like no phone holidays you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.470" end="00:54:04.310" style="s2">like you know getting back to basics and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.450" end="00:54:06.110" style="s2">face to face contact and new things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.310" end="00:54:11.360" style="s2">well the way usually was platform right</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.110" end="00:54:14.210" style="s2">now I can&#39;t engage face to face but I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.069" end="00:57:35.499" style="s2">yes and when was it 2009 I helped to</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.150" end="00:58:00.309" style="s2">work a lot with traditional ecological</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.410" end="00:58:04.059" style="s2">knowledge of indigenous American tribes</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.420" end="00:58:33.549" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah we how do we now that we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.939" end="00:58:36.729" style="s2">approaching 8 billion people on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.549" end="00:58:39.039" style="s2">planet how do we value those cultural</p>

<p begin="00:58:39.039" end="00:58:43.630" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s a lot more people with</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.900" end="00:58:45.880" style="s2">us like on the planet now and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.630" end="00:58:48.329" style="s2">much more brittle system because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.880" end="00:58:51.329" style="s2">degraded ecosystems all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.329" end="00:58:51.329" style="s2">drastically</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.650" end="00:58:58.100" style="s2">well I I think it&#39;s partly the the and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.650" end="00:59:04.520" style="s2">and moving together conversation it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.100" end="00:59:07.800" style="s2">some sort of technological input as well</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.520" end="00:59:11.070" style="s2">but it is as you said that wise choosing</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.800" end="00:59:15.750" style="s2">of their technologies and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.070" end="00:59:19.080" style="s2">necessarily think that the degradation</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.750" end="00:59:21.720" style="s2">that we&#39;ve created is irreversible I</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.080" end="00:59:24.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s a mind shift and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.720" end="00:59:26.370" style="s2">regenerative development is all about if</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.030" end="00:59:29.490" style="s2">we you know put on put on our big girl</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.370" end="00:59:32.520" style="s2">and big boy pants and and say what can I</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.490" end="00:59:35.460" style="s2">do now all eight billion of us turn</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.880" end="01:00:40.740" style="s2">is the people holding on very fiercely</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.860" end="01:00:44.060" style="s2">to old ways that is stopping the full</p>

<p begin="01:00:44.060" end="01:00:52.500" style="s2">hopeful around our ability to actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.570" end="01:00:55.530" style="s2">contribute to future thriving yes our</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.500" end="01:00:57.180" style="s2">population number is a huge issue but</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.530" end="01:00:58.350" style="s2">you know somebody said you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.180" end="01:01:00.600" style="s2">got to have it you&#39;ve got to have a</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.490" end="01:01:17.900" style="s2">then you know turn the world of the</p>

<p begin="01:01:17.900" end="01:01:22.310" style="s2">difficult to make rules around these</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.420" end="01:01:24.830" style="s2">sorts of things yeah about a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.310" end="01:01:27.380" style="s2">that people carry with them no I have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.830" end="01:01:29.420" style="s2">concern actually about because I hear a</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.380" end="01:01:32.660" style="s2">lot of people coming back to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.420" end="01:01:35.090" style="s2">overpopulation issue and and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.660" end="01:01:38.660" style="s2">think that it&#39;s a dangerous mean in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.090" end="01:01:41.210" style="s2">sense that yes over time over a century</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.660" end="01:01:44.900" style="s2">it will probably be wise to slow to</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.210" end="01:01:46.670" style="s2">bring populations numbers down and but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.900" end="01:01:48.410" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a natural process like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.670" end="01:01:52.340" style="s2">we already have the data that shows us</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.410" end="01:01:54.710" style="s2">as soon as you educate women the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.340" end="01:01:57.470" style="s2">number of kids and families do naturally</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.710" end="01:02:01.040" style="s2">go down all over the world and and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.470" end="01:02:02.870" style="s2">most most likely M the human population</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.040" end="01:02:05.860" style="s2">will start dipping in the second half of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.870" end="01:02:09.140" style="s2">the century even if we this this got</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.860" end="01:02:10.370" style="s2">horrible catastrophes but but I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.140" end="01:02:12.050" style="s2">that there&#39;s a sort of right wing</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.370" end="01:02:14.530" style="s2">conversation happening at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.050" end="01:02:20.150" style="s2">that that is almost preparing people for</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.530" end="01:02:22.130" style="s2">justifying some kind of larger was to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.150" end="01:02:24.140" style="s2">reduce population numbers that is really</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.130" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">dangerous and I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.140" end="01:02:30.500" style="s2">you we have the potential to become</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:32.300" style="s2">healers in place for all of us and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.500" end="01:02:36.140" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a benefit that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.300" end="01:02:44.270" style="s2">that many of us and and we we can create</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.140" end="01:02:46.370" style="s2">shared abundance for all of humanity and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.270" end="01:02:49.070" style="s2">that for me that&#39;s that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.370" end="01:02:50.930" style="s2">because like when I hear it&#39;s on one</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.070" end="01:02:53.390" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful to be working with these</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.930" end="01:02:58.820" style="s2">large real estate developers and but but</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.390" end="01:03:01.280" style="s2">to what extent are we still like so many</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.820" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">of the drivers of our current economic</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.280" end="01:03:06.710" style="s2">and monetary system are degenerative</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:09.550" style="s2">it&#39;s structurally driving people to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.710" end="01:03:11.060" style="s2">compete with each other and an exploit</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.550" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.060" end="01:03:15.140" style="s2">and when we have absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:16.940" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s the right model</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.140" end="01:03:21.380" style="s2">under seeing I&#39;m seeing a shifting</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.940" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">conversation at all level yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.380" end="01:03:25.550" style="s2">patterns are moving in the right</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:27.320" style="s2">direction for me like I look past the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.550" end="01:03:29.000" style="s2">Trump&#39;s and the Boris&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.320" end="01:03:31.160" style="s2">neoliberalism movements what happened</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.000" end="01:03:34.370" style="s2">here that&#39;s just kind of blips it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.160" end="01:03:36.950" style="s2">those with power grass of desperation to</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.370" end="01:03:44.140" style="s2">hold on to that without a fearful change</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.950" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">I see the reaction and the consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.140" end="01:03:48.920" style="s2">shifting happening in a response to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:50.870" style="s2">you have this democratic socialist</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.920" end="01:03:54.070" style="s2">movement on the rise across the UK and</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.870" end="01:03:56.660" style="s2">across the u.s. empowerment to you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.070" end="01:03:58.670" style="s2">less advantaged citizen groups happening</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.660" end="01:04:00.740" style="s2">all this movement that&#39;s Blessed unrest</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.670" end="01:04:03.050" style="s2">the politic all value is going book is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.740" end="01:04:04.760" style="s2">really galvanized the global movement</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.050" end="01:04:07.580" style="s2">the climate activism of the next</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.760" end="01:04:11.510" style="s2">generation Retta I mean that new</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.580" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">dimension at scale across the world is</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.510" end="01:04:17.900" style="s2">this global shift of human consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:19.400" style="s2">but we have to we have to protect them</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.900" end="01:04:22.010" style="s2">as one of the things I&#39;m worried about</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.400" end="01:04:24.740" style="s2">this whole young movement around climate</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.010" end="01:04:29.210" style="s2">change isn&#39;t supported with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.740" end="01:04:30.980" style="s2">regenerative narrative of you know just</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.210" end="01:04:34.750" style="s2">just like Pamela Megan and those guys</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.980" end="01:04:38.930" style="s2">say you might see potential at a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.750" end="01:04:40.340" style="s2">and it might come out of twenty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.930" end="01:04:43.190" style="s2">still much better than if you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.340" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">been involved but often these the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.190" end="01:04:47.120" style="s2">idealism of young and wanting to make a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:49.430" style="s2">difference means that they get burnt out</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.120" end="01:04:51.350" style="s2">because I can&#39;t see the impact of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.430" end="01:04:54.050" style="s2">little things that might end up being a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.350" end="01:04:56.600" style="s2">nobody in 10 years time may turn into it</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.050" end="01:04:59.390" style="s2">yes and it really worries me that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.600" end="01:05:01.790" style="s2">not supporting these movements with some</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.390" end="01:05:03.950" style="s2">of that you know thinking that we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.790" end="01:05:06.770" style="s2">all been working on I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.950" end="01:05:09.380" style="s2">big challenge for the next like in terms</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.770" end="01:05:11.330" style="s2">of the urgency of the fierce urgency of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.380" end="01:05:13.040" style="s2">now with climate change now like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.330" end="01:05:18.250" style="s2">really the challenge of the next year or</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.040" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">two to make that connection of this like</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.250" end="01:05:24.830" style="s2">2019 was the year of Greater and</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.520" end="01:05:28.250" style="s2">extinction rebellion and waking</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.830" end="01:05:30.170" style="s2">a whole like massively larger percentage</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.250" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">of the global population up to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.170" end="01:05:36.080" style="s2">urgency to act on climate change but it</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:39.130" style="s2">has been a message of I want you to</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.080" end="01:05:40.760" style="s2">panic extinction is near that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.130" end="01:05:45.740" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.760" end="01:05:48.410" style="s2">urgency driven and and what on the one</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.740" end="01:05:51.260" style="s2">hand that&#39;s activating to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.410" end="01:05:52.490" style="s2">but it is also like if we don&#39;t connect</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.260" end="01:05:55.010" style="s2">that and particularly the young people</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.490" end="01:05:59.050" style="s2">of riders for future movement to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.010" end="01:06:01.580" style="s2">deeper practices that some pioneers that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.050" end="01:06:04.460" style="s2">Jason and I were mentioning earlier like</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.580" end="01:06:07.490" style="s2">like Amory Lovins and Paul Hawkins or my</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.460" end="01:06:11.030" style="s2">mentor John Todd word did my PhD with</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.490" end="01:06:13.220" style="s2">and David David all and permaculture</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.030" end="01:06:16.850" style="s2">movement and and Mollison and all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.220" end="01:06:21.230" style="s2">guys they are we know a lot of ways how</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.850" end="01:06:24.010" style="s2">to heal landscapes and and what if the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.230" end="01:06:26.600" style="s2">discourse of Greta would shift towards</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.010" end="01:06:29.000" style="s2">regeneration as possible we can heal the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.600" end="01:06:32.090" style="s2">planet and we actually know how to and</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.000" end="01:06:34.760" style="s2">then to bring all these young people</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.090" end="01:06:37.750" style="s2">into new types of education systems that</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.760" end="01:06:44.920" style="s2">because our universities are desperately</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.750" end="01:06:48.440" style="s2">seletun the way that they and basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.920" end="01:06:51.290" style="s2">like I was just talking to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.440" end="01:06:53.740" style="s2">yesterday about this this need donor</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.290" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">Macy&#39;s framing of that we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.740" end="01:06:58.640" style="s2">hospice workers to an old system and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:07:01.070" style="s2">midwives to a new and right now all</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.640" end="01:07:05.090" style="s2">these woman&#39;s just look at what&#39;s dying</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.070" end="01:07:08.030" style="s2">and the old system but we&#39;re not having</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.090" end="01:07:11.540" style="s2">enough people in the streets talking for</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.030" end="01:07:13.340" style="s2">that future of us being healers of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.540" end="01:07:16.550" style="s2">planet again and in that process healing</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.340" end="01:07:19.130" style="s2">ourselves and so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.550" end="01:07:24.320" style="s2">key shift that we have to make in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.130" end="01:07:27.350" style="s2">next 24 months what I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.320" end="01:07:30.080" style="s2">do since 2009 create those alternate</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.350" end="01:07:33.650" style="s2">narratives that show us the the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.080" end="01:07:35.800" style="s2">after the disruption yeah yeah we was</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.650" end="01:07:38.330" style="s2">getting this dialogue with</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.800" end="01:07:40.100" style="s2">without Gore in the early days of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.330" end="01:07:42.620" style="s2">climate reality project because it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.100" end="01:07:46.700" style="s2">very you would do his presentation but</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.620" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">it was very dystopian something like cat</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.700" end="01:07:51.020" style="s2">o&#39;clock you know cataclysmic future and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">it was we&#39;re talking about the whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.020" end="01:07:53.090" style="s2">bucket</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.440" end="01:07:54.860" style="s2">you gotta find the opportunity the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.090" end="01:07:58.040" style="s2">opportunistic future and where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.860" end="01:07:59.450" style="s2">hope in that message yeah that show we</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.040" end="01:08:02.990" style="s2">are on the ground work that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.450" end="01:08:05.870" style="s2">and carrying the hope maybe have you</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.990" end="01:08:08.720" style="s2">both connected to this project that has</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.870" end="01:08:13.220" style="s2">just got launched last week calm down</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.720" end="01:08:18.109" style="s2">have you heard of it Mountain is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.220" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">partnership between future stewards Ted</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.109" end="01:08:26.930" style="s2">and YouTube and it&#39;s it&#39;s a process that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:31.580" style="s2">is trying to basically drive on a making</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.930" end="01:08:34.430" style="s2">um it&#39;s the process to drive very the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.580" end="01:08:40.400" style="s2">turn towards basically zero emissions by</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.430" end="01:08:42.380" style="s2">2050 across all sectors using getting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.400" end="01:08:44.810" style="s2">mainstream through channels like Ted and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.380" end="01:08:48.010" style="s2">and YouTube and but really focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.810" end="01:08:50.930" style="s2">solutions focusing on what we can do and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.010" end="01:08:53.180" style="s2">I think it&#39;d be really interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.930" end="01:08:54.680" style="s2">connect both of you into that that that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.180" end="01:08:58.330" style="s2">world and the beginning because Jason</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.680" end="01:09:03.170" style="s2">mentioned Al Gore ago at the launch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.330" end="01:09:05.840" style="s2">countdown mentioned that system</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.170" end="01:09:08.720" style="s2">psychologists quote that things always</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.840" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">take longer than you think but then they</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.720" end="01:09:14.180" style="s2">also happen much faster than you ever</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:15.770" style="s2">thought they would be possible and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.180" end="01:09:18.170" style="s2">think we&#39;re just at that point where it</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.770" end="01:09:21.080" style="s2">feels frustrating for people like us</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.170" end="01:09:24.590" style="s2">who&#39;ve been working on this for 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.080" end="01:09:26.450" style="s2">and how little has shifted and some of</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.590" end="01:09:29.630" style="s2">our mentors have been working on it for</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.450" end="01:09:32.540" style="s2">40 years but I think we&#39;re at the cusp</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.630" end="01:09:36.500" style="s2">of seeing rapid shift happening but it</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.540" end="01:09:38.720" style="s2">is connecting solutions to the people</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.500" end="01:09:40.990" style="s2">were now on the barricade saying we need</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.720" end="01:09:40.990" style="s2">to act</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.489" end="01:09:51.859" style="s2">so III need to go to bed and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.690" end="01:09:53.960" style="s2">sort of thing what to make well it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.859" end="01:09:57.710" style="s2">wonderful to just have this opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.960" end="01:10:04.969" style="s2">to to connect me we&#39;ll do it some other</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.710" end="01:10:08.300" style="s2">time to explore beyond pond yeah so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.969" end="01:10:11.270" style="s2">just send you an email and wrap up with</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.300" end="01:10:13.460" style="s2">Jason just now and and then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.270" end="01:10:15.290" style="s2">see when we have a conversation maybe in</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.460" end="01:10:17.719" style="s2">it does January look good for you for</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.290" end="01:10:21.950" style="s2">another conversation towards the end of</p>

<p begin="01:17:52.369" end="01:17:55.849" style="s2">understanding of regenerative elements</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.079" end="01:17:58.280" style="s2">in your 80,000 years hmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.849" end="01:18:00.050" style="s2">because that that was the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.280" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">conversation with Johnny Freelander that</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.050" end="01:18:06.409" style="s2">that&#39;s I found so fascinating and in</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:08.690" style="s2">October also seems to suggest that what</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.409" end="01:18:11.030" style="s2">happened for him when he met Regenesis</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.690" end="01:18:13.579" style="s2">and the the frameworks of regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.030" end="01:18:16.840" style="s2">development was that he recognized that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.579" end="01:18:16.840" style="s2">he was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.210" end="01:18:26.030" style="s2">a voicing of indigenous wisdom in</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.220" end="01:18:28.130" style="s2">western language that age could build</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.030" end="01:18:32.090" style="s2">the foundations of one side of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.130" end="01:18:33.800" style="s2">bridge and and and and so he like he was</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.090" end="01:18:36.040" style="s2">talking a lot about this framing I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.800" end="01:18:38.930" style="s2">he&#39;d just done a master&#39;s on this of</p>

<p begin="01:18:38.930" end="01:18:45.500" style="s2">Western modernized people with the</p>

<p begin="01:18:45.500" end="01:18:51.740" style="s2">cultures and how how to bridge that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.310" end="01:18:53.780" style="s2">can you close it for one second I just</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.740" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">have to go down there is something I</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.780" end="01:18:57.470" style="s2">want to close out with you I think is</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:19:00.520" style="s2">just running because otherwise I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.470" end="01:19:00.520" style="s2">to file security</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.830" end="01:20:10.520" style="s2">an interesting point to make in</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.930" end="01:20:12.950" style="s2">correlation between regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.520" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">practitioner training and the 12th</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.950" end="01:20:17.540" style="s2">program I&#39;m in these training sessions</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:20.540" style="s2">with Carol and Carol mentored me in</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.540" end="01:20:24.170" style="s2">quite a while Al&#39;s and Seattle and every</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.540" end="01:20:25.940" style="s2">time I it would always like come up in</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.170" end="01:20:29.540" style="s2">conversation with her with Pamela our</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.940" end="01:20:30.950" style="s2">bill Oh sounds like a a well that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.540" end="01:20:33.740" style="s2">like kind of how I&#39;m training in a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.950" end="01:20:35.270" style="s2">not here like you said in a and I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.740" end="01:20:36.650" style="s2">the calls with her or even during the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.270" end="01:20:38.060" style="s2">regenerative practitioner training that</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.650" end="01:20:41.540" style="s2">I went through just to kind of see how</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.060" end="01:20:44.300" style="s2">they taught it I would say that a lot</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.540" end="01:20:47.510" style="s2">and then when I be able my breakout</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.300" end="01:20:49.820" style="s2">sessions I&#39;d be sharing you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.510" end="01:20:51.470" style="s2">twelve-step experience up with the other</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.820" end="01:20:52.810" style="s2">peers in the room and talk about how I</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.470" end="01:20:55.070" style="s2">was trained</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.810" end="01:20:56.810" style="s2">whatever Carol teaching is like oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.070" end="01:21:00.200" style="s2">actually I came to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.810" end="01:21:01.640" style="s2">through my sobriety nothing huh brought</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.200" end="01:21:03.080" style="s2">it up to Carol again and she&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.640" end="01:21:04.550" style="s2">yeah that because the same guy at</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.080" end="01:21:06.800" style="s2">Harvard who created that framework</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.550" end="01:21:08.990" style="s2">influenced bill to create 12-step to</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.800" end="01:21:10.430" style="s2">influence early chrome that&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.990" end="01:21:14.270" style="s2">their general practitioner training idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.430" end="01:21:17.240" style="s2">so the same guy at Harvard developed</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.270" end="01:21:19.610" style="s2">that theory of change and framework that</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.240" end="01:21:21.380" style="s2">influenced the creation of 12 steps was</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.610" end="01:21:24.230" style="s2">the same person that the Charlie Brown</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.380" end="01:21:29.210" style="s2">used that&#39;s influenced Pamela and Bill</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.230" end="01:21:31.670" style="s2">and Ben on Vijender practice so from a</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.210" end="01:21:33.890" style="s2">governance perspective I always like 12a</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.670" end="01:21:35.000" style="s2">is really interesting as an NA there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.890" end="01:21:36.950" style="s2">probably like three million people</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.000" end="01:21:39.920" style="s2">worldwide it&#39;s not a huge amount people</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.950" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s self governed there&#39;s leaders</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.920" end="01:21:44.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very democratic around self funded</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:47.400" style="s2">this exclusion of media like the rules</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.990" end="01:21:49.110" style="s2">and traditions of the 12-step program</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.400" end="01:21:51.210" style="s2">a really interesting to look at a</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.110" end="01:21:55.110" style="s2">context of how we structure society</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.210" end="01:21:58.190" style="s2">there&#39;s making but the principles the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.110" end="01:22:01.500" style="s2">steps are like destruction of the ego</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.190" end="01:22:04.380" style="s2">not destruction but much to tempering</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.500" end="01:22:07.080" style="s2">down of the ego and how I engage the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.380" end="01:22:08.430" style="s2">world everyday I guess it&#39;s a when I</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.080" end="01:22:11.790" style="s2">talk about with what I&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.430" end="01:22:13.500" style="s2">regenerate or training it&#39;s like I every</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.790" end="01:22:15.120" style="s2">day have to wake up and grab myself</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.500" end="01:22:17.070" style="s2">right and I put my feet on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.120" end="01:22:19.710" style="s2">and say I belong to the earth and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.070" end="01:22:23.010" style="s2">service to life but I learned how to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.710" end="01:22:24.690" style="s2">that kind of stuff through hey when I</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.010" end="01:22:26.970" style="s2">had to wake up and read literature call</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.690" end="01:22:30.690" style="s2">my sponsor and set my like train my</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.970" end="01:22:32.790" style="s2">brain to just start the way I need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.690" end="01:22:36.210" style="s2">engage everyone around me that day or</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.790" end="01:22:37.920" style="s2">life around them that day so I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.210" end="01:22:39.630" style="s2">sure that I&#39;m not self-seeking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.920" end="01:22:42.270" style="s2">making sure I&#39;m not making decisions on</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.630" end="01:22:44.610" style="s2">my ego I&#39;m making sure I&#39;m being service</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.270" end="01:22:47.580" style="s2">to people around me so it&#39;s the humidity</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.610" end="01:22:49.320" style="s2">factor in that the mentality the mental</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.580" end="01:22:52.260" style="s2">model I start my day with right and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.320" end="01:22:55.890" style="s2">learned that in the 12-step program just</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.260" end="01:22:58.740" style="s2">happened just by chance my journey as a</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.890" end="01:23:00.810" style="s2">regenerative practitioner was so deeply</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.740" end="01:23:03.540" style="s2">aligned with that but I had no idea you</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.810" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">know I know with how much it&#39;s helped me</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.540" end="01:23:09.060" style="s2">as a practitioner and a change agent</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:12.480" style="s2">because of my sobriety and learnings I</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.060" end="01:23:16.230" style="s2">got from becoming sober and using 12</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.480" end="01:23:20.970" style="s2">steps so this is really it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.230" end="01:23:23.250" style="s2">because you know so much of the like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.970" end="01:23:26.070" style="s2">framing of what&#39;s wrong with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.250" end="01:23:29.880" style="s2">degenerative human presence on earth is</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.070" end="01:23:32.040" style="s2">really you could say we&#39;re a heavily</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.880" end="01:23:35.970" style="s2">addicted culture to patthamas</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.040" end="01:23:37.770" style="s2">of using more and more to fill gaps that</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.970" end="01:23:40.350" style="s2">you actually can&#39;t fill materially</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.770" end="01:23:44.150" style="s2">because you need to fill it in meaning</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.350" end="01:23:47.430" style="s2">and immaterial ebert with Reap</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.150" end="01:23:49.550" style="s2">reconnecting to to nourishing</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.430" end="01:23:53.010" style="s2">relationships to place and people and</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.550" end="01:23:54.810" style="s2">and and I think oh advertising this</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.010" end="01:23:57.960" style="s2">forces us to proceed how we should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.810" end="01:23:59.989" style="s2">right it&#39;s like is create a conundrum so</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.960" end="01:24:07.280" style="s2">in many ways too</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.989" end="01:24:11.239" style="s2">EAL the the patterns of degeneration in</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:13.909" style="s2">our globalized is isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.239" end="01:24:18.699" style="s2">getting rid of an addiction and so the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.909" end="01:24:18.699" style="s2">so it kind of makes perfect sense that</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.880" end="01:24:23.659" style="s2">similarity what&#39;s the what&#39;s the name of</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.590" end="01:24:35.030" style="s2">the the guy who actually developed at</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.659" end="01:24:37.940" style="s2">harvard you mentioned you know here</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.030" end="01:24:40.099" style="s2">right well email sec no not very well</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.940" end="01:24:41.659" style="s2">but yes you see me like wait wait</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.099" end="01:24:43.730" style="s2">actually I haven&#39;t I&#39;ve never talked to</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.659" end="01:24:48.530" style="s2">Carol and personally yet we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.730" end="01:24:50.599" style="s2">couple of emails exchanges so she does</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.530" end="01:24:53.749" style="s2">it she&#39;s very candid to it&#39;s not like it</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.599" end="01:24:57.219" style="s2">opened it&#39;s like this is the way you do</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.749" end="01:24:57.219" style="s2">it kind of thing it&#39;s great she&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="01:25:17.449" end="01:25:20.360" style="s2">like I need to make that step of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.949" end="01:25:22.610" style="s2">actually having conversation with her</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.360" end="01:25:24.409" style="s2">because I looking from from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.610" end="01:25:26.960" style="s2">it is is that prickly kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.409" end="01:25:28.849" style="s2">maintaining the lineage and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.960" end="01:25:30.380" style="s2">bit of an energy that I perceived</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.849" end="01:25:33.019" style="s2">because I haven&#39;t really met her yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.380" end="01:25:37.489" style="s2">that there is that reminds me of the old</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.019" end="01:25:39.460" style="s2">martial art and if you have to empty</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.489" end="01:25:44.599" style="s2">your glass so I can fill its type</p>

<p begin="01:30:00.700" end="01:30:05.050" style="s2">mean this is this is the deep question</p>

<p begin="01:30:05.050" end="01:30:11.170" style="s2">it like before we can answer what we</p>

<p begin="01:30:13.420" end="01:30:17.620" style="s2">have to ask a deeper question which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.430" end="01:30:20.380" style="s2">why are we worth sustaining and I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.620" end="01:30:23.320" style="s2">Aboriginal cultures have a lot more to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.380" end="01:30:26.470" style="s2">answer like reasons why are they worth</p>

<p begin="01:30:32.230" end="01:30:36.990" style="s2">behavior isn&#39;t worth sustaining we</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.330" end="01:30:39.340" style="s2">really need to reinvent ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.990" end="01:30:41.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a training</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.340" end="01:30:43.210" style="s2">had to go through training on this was a</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.050" end="01:30:46.659" style="s2">book called decolonizing solidarity so</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.210" end="01:30:48.639" style="s2">it helps train understand non-indigenous</p>

<p begin="01:30:52.239" end="01:30:58.630" style="s2">this level of respect and rapport with</p>

<p begin="01:31:01.030" end="01:31:04.929" style="s2">like burdening guilt that contemporary</p>

<p begin="01:31:04.929" end="01:31:08.530" style="s2">don&#39;t maybe they don&#39;t engage it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.849" end="01:31:10.389" style="s2">also a deep lack of awareness about</p>

<p begin="01:31:18.989" end="01:31:25.980" style="s2">or any place in learning so it&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.000" end="01:31:28.540" style="s2">this much deeper value impact it has and</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.980" end="01:31:29.290" style="s2">so we&#39;re just going on that journey man</p>
