<p begin="00:00:50.400" end="00:00:56.020" style="s2">well thank you very much it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.590" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">pleasure to be here in this massive hall</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.020" end="00:01:02.920" style="s2">I can&#39;t believe that all of you decided</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:04.570" style="s2">that coming to talk about the topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.920" end="00:01:09.190" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about tonight was</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.570" end="00:01:13.180" style="s2">the top priority in your life but but</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.190" end="00:01:15.610" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can justify that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.180" end="00:01:17.710" style="s2">know that might be a good that might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.610" end="00:01:18.520" style="s2">a good aim see if we could make it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.710" end="00:01:24.610" style="s2">worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.520" end="00:01:29.440" style="s2">so make your decision correct so you may</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.610" end="00:01:37.479" style="s2">know or not that I was on a television</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.440" end="00:01:41.229" style="s2">show last night Q&amp;A apparently you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.479" end="00:01:45.580" style="s2">that some of you anyways I can&#39;t say I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.229" end="00:01:48.430" style="s2">enjoyed it really really it&#39;s funny you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.580" end="00:01:51.159" style="s2">know like I think as I&#39;ve got farther</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.430" end="00:01:54.100" style="s2">along in doing whatever it is that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.159" end="00:01:58.120" style="s2">happen to be doing I find those events</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.100" end="00:02:00.190" style="s2">more and more stressful I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.120" end="00:02:04.810" style="s2">exactly what it is I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.190" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">proclivity of everything everything has</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.810" end="00:02:11.230" style="s2">to be mangled in some sense into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:13.690" style="s2">preset format you know and and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.230" end="00:02:16.299" style="s2">fundamental format really is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.690" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">everything has to be political you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.299" end="00:02:23.080" style="s2">and everything isn&#39;t political so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:24.489" style="s2">not helpful</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.080" end="00:02:28.510" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to discuss things</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.489" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">that aren&#39;t political and I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.510" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">complaining about it well I suppose I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.310" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s surprising to me how</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:42.070" style="s2">how how</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:44.530" style="s2">how much it how much it takes out of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.070" end="00:02:47.380" style="s2">say compared to doing an event like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:49.060" style="s2">which I really enjoy doing like I spent</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.380" end="00:02:50.740" style="s2">a lot of time preparing and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.060" end="00:02:53.470" style="s2">lot of you and I really want it to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.740" end="00:03:00.069" style="s2">well and all that but this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.470" end="00:03:02.650" style="s2">much less dreadful haha I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.069" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">right and you know and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.650" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">strange constraints on format you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:12.280" style="s2">people ask very complex questions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:14.709" style="s2">and then you have a minute to answer and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.280" end="00:03:16.660" style="s2">you know there&#39;s something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.709" end="00:03:18.489" style="s2">something downright sinful about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.660" end="00:03:21.489" style="s2">answering a really complicated question</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.489" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">in a minute because it sort of suggests</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.489" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">that complex questions have answers that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:31.030" style="s2">take one minute and they don&#39;t they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.510" end="00:03:33.220" style="s2">answers that take God sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.030" end="00:03:35.170" style="s2">take decades sometimes they take</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.220" end="00:03:36.970" style="s2">thousands of years you know but of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.170" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">course I can&#39;t expect a television show</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.970" end="00:03:43.060" style="s2">to allow for a thousands of years but</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:44.860" style="s2">but the format itself works against the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:46.629" style="s2">kind of thought that&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.860" end="00:03:50.620" style="s2">actually have discussions that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.629" end="00:03:53.890" style="s2">necessary and so anyways having said all</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.620" end="00:03:57.940" style="s2">that it went it went oh it went all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.890" end="00:04:01.060" style="s2">right I would say there were no nasty</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.940" end="00:04:03.700" style="s2">surprises and particularly and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.060" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">civil discussion whether it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.700" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">productive discussion or not is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:09.580" style="s2">different matter but it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">unproductive discussion and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.580" end="00:04:15.430" style="s2">something but there was one question</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">that came up and I thought I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.430" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">actually start talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.320" end="00:04:22.690" style="s2">question tonight because I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">happy I&#39;ve been asked this question a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">lot and I&#39;ve never been happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:31.080" style="s2">answer that I&#39;ve given to it and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:33.640" style="s2">never really been able to exactly get my</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.080" end="00:04:35.979" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been able to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.640" end="00:04:39.159" style="s2">exactly why I haven&#39;t been happy with</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.979" end="00:04:41.979" style="s2">the question and so I&#39;m gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.159" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">answer it properly tonight and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.979" end="00:04:45.789" style="s2">going to talk more generally about 12</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.570" style="s2">rules about the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.789" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">now it&#39;s fine this question is directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.570" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">relevant to the book and so it should</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:55.750" style="s2">make for a good lead-in but it&#39;ll enable</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:58.570" style="s2">us to talk about something that I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.750" end="00:05:01.229" style="s2">is really very much worth talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.570" end="00:05:05.639" style="s2">and I hope I can formulate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.229" end="00:05:08.939" style="s2">properly and then formulate the proper</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.639" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">sir at least more coherently than I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.939" end="00:05:14.430" style="s2">managed its see I have I have this I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:17.129" style="s2">followed this rule for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.430" end="00:05:20.580" style="s2">which I actually found was a Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.129" end="00:05:22.409" style="s2">rule I didn&#39;t know this until really</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.580" end="00:05:25.849" style="s2">quite recently until I wrote 12 rules</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.409" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">for life Socrates said that he had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.849" end="00:05:33.749" style="s2">daemon and by which he meant an internal</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:35.939" style="s2">voice and he said that at all he always</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.749" end="00:05:37.379" style="s2">listened to it and then that was what</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.939" end="00:05:38.879" style="s2">made him different from other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.379" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">that he always listened to this voice</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.879" end="00:05:46.169" style="s2">and the voice didn&#39;t tell him what to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">he told him what not to do and when the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.169" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">Delphic Oracle proclaimed that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:57.509" style="s2">was the wisest man in Greece in Athens</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:06:00.779" style="s2">and in Greece one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.509" end="00:06:04.889" style="s2">Socrates attributed her decision to deem</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.779" end="00:06:07.139" style="s2">him the wisest man was because while she</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.889" end="00:06:10.139" style="s2">said he knew he knew nothing but he knew</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.139" end="00:06:11.639" style="s2">in part that he knew nothing at least in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.139" end="00:06:14.129" style="s2">part because he was always listening to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.639" end="00:06:15.839" style="s2">the voice of his Damon his internal</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.129" end="00:06:18.689" style="s2">conscience and then I just found out the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.839" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">other day that the word democracy comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.689" end="00:06:23.939" style="s2">from the same root which is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:25.589" style="s2">interesting like I had no idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.939" end="00:06:27.419" style="s2">was the case because what it suggests</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.589" end="00:06:30.810" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.419" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">looking at how words are related to one</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.810" end="00:06:33.479" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">historically because you find strange</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.479" end="00:06:36.839" style="s2">connections between ideas that you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:39.899" style="s2">never imagine and sometimes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.839" end="00:06:42.750" style="s2">unbelievably profound and so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.899" end="00:06:44.849" style="s2">what happened historically is that well</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.750" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">so there was a concept of the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.849" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">Damon now it was the Damon that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:52.889" style="s2">listened to when he decided that he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:54.539" style="s2">not going to run when the Athenians</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.889" end="00:06:57.029" style="s2">decided that they were going to put him</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.539" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">to death the Athenian aristocrats right</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.029" end="00:07:00.419" style="s2">because they thought that he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:02.909" style="s2">corrupting the youth by you know talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.419" end="00:07:04.889" style="s2">to them and telling them the truth and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.909" end="00:07:07.949" style="s2">suppose that&#39;s certainly grounds for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.889" end="00:07:09.539" style="s2">chasing someone out of your town anyways</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.949" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">they gave him plenty of notice because</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.539" end="00:07:13.649" style="s2">they didn&#39;t really want to kill him they</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:15.750" style="s2">just wanted to get the old goat the hell</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.649" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">out to some other city where he could</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.750" end="00:07:20.250" style="s2">cause trouble there and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.060" end="00:07:23.940" style="s2">his friends were you know making plans</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.250" end="00:07:26.730" style="s2">to get to scurry him away from Athens</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.940" end="00:07:31.140" style="s2">and he went out consulted his Damon and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.730" end="00:07:33.810" style="s2">it told him not to leave and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.140" end="00:07:37.830" style="s2">big shark to Socrates because of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.810" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">he didn&#39;t want to die and but yet he had</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.830" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">decided that he was always going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:45.510" style="s2">follow the dictates of the damon and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.850" style="s2">so he did something that only a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.510" end="00:07:49.590" style="s2">philosopher would do was reversed his</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.850" end="00:07:53.670" style="s2">assumptions he thought oh well I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.590" end="00:07:56.820" style="s2">afraid of dying and my Damon said stick</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.670" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">around and so I must be wrong it must be</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:08.040" style="s2">internal voice than to risk this form of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.480" end="00:08:09.480" style="s2">death you know which is question you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.040" end="00:08:10.770" style="s2">have to really wrestle with and when his</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.770" end="00:08:15.990" style="s2">happy about but in any case he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.110" end="00:08:19.020" style="s2">run and we have two good court like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.990" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">documents attesting to that one written</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.020" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">by someone named Xenophon and the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:26.100" style="s2">by Plato they&#39;re very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:28.350" style="s2">documents I would highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.100" end="00:08:29.700" style="s2">reading them they&#39;re very short and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.350" end="00:08:31.230" style="s2">reason one of the reasons I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.700" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">recommend reading them apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.230" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">fact that they&#39;re fascinating and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:40.580" style="s2">short is that you also get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:44.550" style="s2">from from what Socrates wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.580" end="00:08:47.730" style="s2">because he had lived his life fully you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.550" end="00:08:50.220" style="s2">know no holds barred in some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.730" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">he could let it go when the time came</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.220" end="00:08:54.840" style="s2">and and that&#39;s an interesting thing you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.770" end="00:08:57.870" style="s2">know because well it&#39;s a question I</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.840" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">think that we all wrestle with we should</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.870" end="00:09:02.760" style="s2">is like well is there a purpose to our</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:06.060" style="s2">life and well that&#39;s a hard question and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.760" end="00:09:08.400" style="s2">then if there is a purpose well how is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.060" end="00:09:10.530" style="s2">it expressed and then if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.400" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">purpose and our lives are truncated as</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.530" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">they are by death then how can that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">purpose have significance and those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">hard questions but Socrates experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">seemed to be that he had lived enough in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:26.490" style="s2">his life so that when push came to shove</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:28.890" style="s2">which it certainly did he was able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.490" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">gracefully let it go</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.890" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:36.329" style="s2">and you know he attested to that with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.899" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">his death and and and that&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.329" end="00:09:41.100" style="s2">convincing you know I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">fairly convincing argument and it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.100" end="00:09:45.869" style="s2">that I find well it&#39;s hard to tell if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:48.119" style="s2">find it exactly credible but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.869" end="00:09:50.819" style="s2">find it incredible I mean I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.119" end="00:09:55.889" style="s2">have noticed that as I&#39;ve got older and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.819" end="00:09:59.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve done things various what would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.889" end="00:10:01.049" style="s2">say accomplished isn&#39;t exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.100" end="00:10:04.199" style="s2">word I&#39;ve participated in many things</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.199" end="00:10:09.269" style="s2">them but wouldn&#39;t necessarily go back</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.839" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">and participate in them again it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.269" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">of as if when you do something and you</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:21.869" style="s2">have to do it again and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.239" end="00:10:25.019" style="s2">possible who knows that if you finish</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.869" end="00:10:28.980" style="s2">your life whatever that might mean if</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.019" end="00:10:31.709" style="s2">you exhaust your life then then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.980" end="00:10:34.619" style="s2">enough life you know that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.709" end="00:10:37.139" style="s2">enough and I mean that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>

<p begin="00:10:43.889" end="00:10:49.709" style="s2">there&#39;s still that that that curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.799" end="00:10:52.740" style="s2">about the relationship between life and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.709" end="00:10:57.649" style="s2">mortality and and the possibility that a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.740" end="00:11:00.980" style="s2">life well-lived exhausts itself in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.649" end="00:11:05.689" style="s2">fundamental sense so that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.980" end="00:11:08.910" style="s2">satisfied let&#39;s say with with what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.689" end="00:11:10.920" style="s2">with what you were there is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.910" end="00:11:15.350" style="s2">psychological evidence that bears on</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.920" end="00:11:18.299" style="s2">this if you ask people what they regret</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.350" end="00:11:22.470" style="s2">especially as they get older what they</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.299" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">generally port is things not done so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:25.829" style="s2">they don&#39;t regret so much mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.419" style="s2">they&#39;ve made although of course people</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.829" end="00:11:31.529" style="s2">obviously regret mistakes they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.419" end="00:11:34.379" style="s2">as well so they don&#39;t exactly regret</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.529" end="00:11:36.660" style="s2">sins of commission right errors that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.379" end="00:11:42.660" style="s2">they&#39;ve actively made they they miss</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.660" end="00:11:44.730" style="s2">they they torment themselves for</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.660" end="00:11:45.300" style="s2">opportunities that had presented</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.300" end="00:11:52.020" style="s2">that they did not let&#39;s say exploit or</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:55.050" style="s2">engage in and I think that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.020" end="00:11:58.140" style="s2">thinking about too because one thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.050" end="00:12:01.800" style="s2">that I have become convinced about with</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.140" end="00:12:03.959" style="s2">regards to human consciousness which i</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.800" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">think is equivalent to the spark of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.959" end="00:12:08.970" style="s2">divinity in some sense that our</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">fundamental stories insists as being</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.970" end="00:12:14.220" style="s2">placed within us is that human</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:16.860" style="s2">consciousness is that faculty that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.220" end="00:12:18.750" style="s2">confronts potential itself I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.860" end="00:12:20.220" style="s2">there&#39;s good neurological evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.750" end="00:12:24.110" style="s2">this by the way for those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.220" end="00:12:28.709" style="s2">scientifically minded because we build</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.110" end="00:12:31.170" style="s2">circuits within us for habitual action</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.709" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">that we&#39;ve practiced many times that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.170" end="00:12:35.730" style="s2">seem to run in a very deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:37.560" style="s2">fashion and we are a strange combination</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.730" end="00:12:40.020" style="s2">of deterministic and non-deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.560" end="00:12:42.510" style="s2">as far as I can tell but what our</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.020" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">consciousness seems to be for is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.510" end="00:12:48.089" style="s2">encounter those things that we have not</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">yet encountered and those things that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.089" end="00:12:52.920" style="s2">have not yet encountered seem to me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:55.589" style="s2">be those things that have not yet been</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.920" end="00:12:57.630" style="s2">brought into being and so you could say</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.589" end="00:13:00.899" style="s2">that what our consciousness is for is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.630" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">for the encounter with potential you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.899" end="00:13:05.640" style="s2">know that our consciousness is further</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:09.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not for the past it&#39;s not even for</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.640" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">the present it&#39;s to transform the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.000" end="00:13:12.779" style="s2">into the present and and really that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:13.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what our consciousness does when</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.779" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">you wake up in the morning you have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.950" end="00:13:18.899" style="s2">new day ahead of you and the day could</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">take you in very many directions and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.899" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">the weeks and the years all of that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.300" style="s2">take you in very many directions and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">have some apprehension about what those</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.300" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">directions might be you have some</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:33.720" style="s2">apprehension about what role your</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">choices might make in transforming that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.720" end="00:13:39.029" style="s2">potential into one form of actuality or</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:41.220" style="s2">another I mean you certainly know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.029" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">there are dreadful mistakes that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.220" end="00:13:45.720" style="s2">might be very tempted to make that would</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.970" style="s2">produce all manner of Hell around you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.720" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">and still be tempted to do it it seems</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.970" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">like it&#39;s sitting there right in front</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:54.750" style="s2">of you as a possibility you also know</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.200" end="00:13:56.850" style="s2">that you know you could haul yourself up</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:13:57.990" style="s2">out of bed and attend to your duties and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.850" end="00:13:59.080" style="s2">do the sorts of things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.990" end="00:14:01.330" style="s2">supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.080" end="00:14:04.540" style="s2">a few things right that day and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.330" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">weekend that likely things would at</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.540" end="00:14:10.840" style="s2">least not be worse and they would</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">probably be better and I believe that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.840" end="00:14:15.640" style="s2">do believe that I don&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:17.800" style="s2">this can be the case I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.640" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">how it is that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.800" end="00:14:22.450" style="s2">consciousness can function in that way</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:24.670" style="s2">because I think to understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.450" end="00:14:27.910" style="s2">would have to understand what it means</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.670" end="00:14:30.730" style="s2">for the future to be only potential</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.910" end="00:14:33.730" style="s2">rather than actuality and who the hell</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.730" end="00:14:35.410" style="s2">understands that I mean no one and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.730" end="00:14:37.840" style="s2">we&#39;d have to understand how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.410" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">our conscious choices and our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.840" end="00:14:44.770" style="s2">ethical choices transform that</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.360" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">upgrade ourselves for example when we do</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:23.230" style="s2">right so here&#39;s here&#39;s the question that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.800" end="00:17:25.180" style="s2">came up last night and this is a strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">question for what is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.180" end="00:17:32.130" style="s2">political show near the end a gentleman</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:37.179" style="s2">on videotape came up and and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.130" end="00:17:38.890" style="s2">discussed the topic of human dignity not</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.179" end="00:17:41.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not a topic you hear a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.890" end="00:17:43.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of topics that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.500" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">related to human beings that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.300" end="00:17:49.000" style="s2">hear a lot about anymore you don&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:53.770" style="s2">a lot about nobility you don&#39;t hear a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.000" end="00:17:57.910" style="s2">lot about endurance let&#39;s say stalwart</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.770" end="00:18:04.179" style="s2">Ness courage dignity those aren&#39;t values</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.910" end="00:18:06.429" style="s2">that we discuss much responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.179" end="00:18:08.610" style="s2">being another one which is one I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.429" end="00:18:10.809" style="s2">thrilled about all things considered</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.610" end="00:18:13.929" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s the pathway to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.809" end="00:18:16.809" style="s2">meaning itself but so hit his was the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.929" end="00:18:21.010" style="s2">topic of human dignity and he asked us a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.809" end="00:18:22.780" style="s2">question do you believe in God and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.010" end="00:18:24.730" style="s2">he said as a Catholic I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.780" end="00:18:27.070" style="s2">other way that we can have a universe</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.730" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">with dignity and so I&#39;m not so concerned</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.070" end="00:18:31.480" style="s2">about the second part of his commentary</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:33.550" style="s2">although I might get to that but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.480" end="00:18:36.250" style="s2">first part do you believe in God</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.550" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">is a question that&#39;s been leveled at me</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.250" end="00:18:43.929" style="s2">many times and I&#39;m going to come other</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">people on the panel and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.929" end="00:18:49.720" style="s2">just review what they said briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:51.910" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to talk about what I said</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.720" end="00:18:55.540" style="s2">and then I&#39;m going to fix what I said I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.910" end="00:18:56.790" style="s2">hope so that it&#39;s better at least that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.790" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">so Terry Butler who&#39;s was a laborer is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:06.700" style="s2">labor front bencher said I&#39;m agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">people are inherently valuable because</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:15.130" style="s2">and no that doesn&#39;t work out very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.750" end="00:19:17.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s one of those</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.320" end="00:19:22.360" style="s2">only ten seconds because you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.500" end="00:19:24.130" style="s2">make the opposite argument and people do</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.360" end="00:19:26.890" style="s2">all the time you know like the Club of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.130" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">Rome for example which was an</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.890" end="00:19:33.490" style="s2">organization in Rome</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">logically enough formed in the 60s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.490" end="00:19:37.659" style="s2">was very much concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2">terribly detrimental effect that human</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.659" end="00:19:41.830" style="s2">beings were having on the planet and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:44.649" style="s2">believe it was one of the Club of Rome</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.830" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">members who coined the idea and and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.649" end="00:19:48.429" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it was someone who was</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:50.620" style="s2">thinking exactly the same way so works</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.429" end="00:19:53.020" style="s2">out either way that human beings were</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.620" end="00:19:54.760" style="s2">something approximating a cancer on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.020" end="00:19:55.830" style="s2">planet you know because of all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.760" end="00:19:57.970" style="s2">terrible things we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.830" end="00:19:59.529" style="s2">ecologically and so forth that was back</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.970" end="00:20:03.370" style="s2">when people believed we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.529" end="00:20:05.529" style="s2">over populate the planet to such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.370" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">degree by the year 2000 that there would</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.529" end="00:20:12.870" style="s2">be widespread privation and starvation</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:18.190" style="s2">which by the way if you haven&#39;t noticed</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.870" end="00:20:19.720" style="s2">there isn&#39;t and and you know if you look</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.190" end="00:20:22.419" style="s2">at the terrible things that people do</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.720" end="00:20:24.520" style="s2">apart from the despoiling of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.419" end="00:20:27.159" style="s2">environment let&#39;s say there&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.520" end="00:20:30.279" style="s2">you know malevolence that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.159" end="00:20:33.429" style="s2">with human interactions and also human</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.279" end="00:20:35.620" style="s2">social systems and it isn&#39;t so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.429" end="00:20:37.809" style="s2">as a consequence of that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.620" end="00:20:39.700" style="s2">make a straightforward case that human</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.809" end="00:20:41.529" style="s2">beings are inherently valuable merely</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:44.110" style="s2">because they&#39;re human beings because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.529" end="00:20:46.390" style="s2">can eat make an equally logical case</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.110" end="00:20:49.299" style="s2">from first principles that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.390" end="00:20:53.169" style="s2">inherently well destructive or that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.299" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">should be perhaps limited in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.169" end="00:20:58.659" style="s2">ability to procreate or that they are a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:01.480" style="s2">catastrophe for the planet as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.659" end="00:21:04.899" style="s2">or that our entire history is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.480" end="00:21:07.210" style="s2">but a sequence of on what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.899" end="00:21:09.909" style="s2">unrequited malevolence and that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.210" end="00:21:11.789" style="s2">generally can&#39;t be trusted and so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.909" end="00:21:16.649" style="s2">don&#39;t find that answer particularly</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.789" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">satisfying I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.649" end="00:21:21.430" style="s2">it&#39;s just self referential people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">inherently valuable because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.430" end="00:21:26.620" style="s2">people it&#39;s like well you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:29.980" style="s2">get anywhere with an answer like that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:31.720" style="s2">so she&#39;s agnostic and and then and but</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.980" end="00:21:34.330" style="s2">then she has this idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">despite her agnosticism that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.330" end="00:21:42.160" style="s2">make the case a priori with nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:45.250" style="s2">resummon heritable and seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.160" end="00:21:46.780" style="s2">that requires a little more depth and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.250" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">little more explanation for it to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.780" end="00:21:50.590" style="s2">actually be convincing you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s not obvious to me that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.590" end="00:21:54.610" style="s2">themselves think that they&#39;re valuable</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:55.900" style="s2">all the time often they don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.610" end="00:21:58.450" style="s2">at all they don&#39;t certainly don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.900" end="00:21:59.770" style="s2">that often when they&#39;re depressed they</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:22:01.750" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t think that when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.770" end="00:22:03.550" style="s2">suicidal they don&#39;t really think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.750" end="00:22:05.860" style="s2">when they&#39;re ashamed or guilty or</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.550" end="00:22:07.900" style="s2">frustrated or disappointed or angry or</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.860" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">waking up at 3:00 in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.900" end="00:22:11.890" style="s2">tormenting themselves with their</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:13.030" style="s2">consciences they don&#39;t necessarily think</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.030" end="00:22:17.080" style="s2">family or when they&#39;re upset at work or</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.160" end="00:22:21.250" style="s2">you know when things go wrong in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.080" end="00:22:24.040" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not so bloody obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.250" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">people are inherently valuable and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.040" end="00:22:27.580" style="s2">then you might also notice that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">kind of easy to think that some people</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.580" end="00:22:30.610" style="s2">are more valuable than others</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:32.560" style="s2">sort of like an animal farm you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.610" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">where the animals were all equal except</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.560" end="00:22:35.290" style="s2">that some animals were more equal than</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.690" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.290" end="00:22:39.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s very easy for human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.690" end="00:22:41.560" style="s2">think that about other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.340" end="00:22:44.170" style="s2">because no matter where you look in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.560" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">human societies there are rank orders of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.170" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">value right in in any hierarchy that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">produce that&#39;s associated with some</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.460" style="s2">ability we find that some people are so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.570" end="00:22:55.660" style="s2">much better at whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.460" end="00:22:58.810" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that it&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.660" end="00:23:01.720" style="s2">miracle and most people are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.810" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">dreadful at it and so you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">were thinking about inherent value as</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.620" style="s2">something associated with something with</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:11.020" style="s2">with an approximation of skill or</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.620" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">competence then it wouldn&#39;t be obvious</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.020" end="00:23:14.350" style="s2">from the structure of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:15.700" style="s2">people were inherently valuable in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.350" end="00:23:17.830" style="s2">manner either because there&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.700" end="00:23:19.540" style="s2">rank order difference in our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.830" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">do things you know and you might say</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.540" end="00:23:23.800" style="s2">well that kind of averages out across</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:26.680" style="s2">things but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.800" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">strong argument either so so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.680" end="00:23:31.150" style="s2">it&#39;s bloody well not obvious I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">you it&#39;s not obvious where this idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.150" end="00:23:35.110" style="s2">that people are inherently valuable came</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.340" end="00:23:38.110" style="s2">from that&#39;s a tough one</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:41.769" style="s2">you know an end and in and in and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.110" end="00:23:44.230" style="s2">aristocratic states or or tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.769" end="00:23:47.140" style="s2">states it&#39;s certainly not obvious at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.230" end="00:23:48.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s any acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.140" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">notion that people are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.580" end="00:23:54.340" style="s2">valuable it&#39;s like there&#39;s no necessary</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:57.250" style="s2">presumption of innocence for example and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.340" end="00:23:59.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any sovereign right to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.250" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">your own destiny like you&#39;re not granted</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.890" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">the rights not granted because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:08.289" style="s2">the wrong way of thinking about it your</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:10.779" style="s2">rights as a sovereign individual who has</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.289" end="00:24:13.419" style="s2">the responsibility and the capability to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.779" end="00:24:16.299" style="s2">determine the destiny of the state</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.419" end="00:24:18.070" style="s2">itself don&#39;t exist that doesn&#39;t exist as</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.299" end="00:24:20.230" style="s2">a concept and so I don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.070" end="00:24:22.389" style="s2">there&#39;s anything there that speaks of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.230" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">inherent value either so it&#39;s by no</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.389" end="00:24:27.519" style="s2">means an obvious concept in fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the least obvious concepts</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.519" end="00:24:32.649" style="s2">that human beings have ever come up with</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:37.659" style="s2">that each of us in some strange manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.649" end="00:24:40.389" style="s2">is is is to be attributed some divine</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.659" end="00:24:43.419" style="s2">spark let&#39;s say that makes us equal in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.389" end="00:24:44.860" style="s2">some fundamental way before God you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.419" end="00:24:45.789" style="s2">before the reality of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.860" end="00:24:49.029" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.789" end="00:24:52.360" style="s2">even in relationship to our own laws I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.029" end="00:24:54.909" style="s2">mean if you want a miracle for an idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I can&#39;t think of one</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.909" end="00:25:00.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s more unlikely than that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve been puzzling over that for a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.730" end="00:25:05.320" style="s2">long time because I cannot understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:08.860" style="s2">why in the world that idea ever came to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.320" end="00:25:11.529" style="s2">be or how in the world we ever agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.860" end="00:25:14.019" style="s2">act as if it was true it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.529" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">something and we should let that go with</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.019" end="00:25:19.539" style="s2">we let that idea go to our great peril</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.230" end="00:25:21.549" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.539" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">fundamental idea and what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.549" end="00:25:26.440" style="s2">interesting about it too is that once</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:28.990" style="s2">you have that idea weird as it is and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.440" end="00:25:32.500" style="s2">improbable as it is and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.990" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">organize your social relationships in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.500" end="00:25:39.190" style="s2">accordance with it well then they work</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:40.630" style="s2">you know so my rule two is treat</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.190" end="00:25:42.549" style="s2">yourself as if you&#39;re someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.630" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">responsible for helping and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.549" end="00:25:47.049" style="s2">predicated on the idea that regardless</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:48.250" style="s2">of your inadequacies and your</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.049" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">malevolence which</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.250" end="00:25:52.059" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sure you have many</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:53.860" style="s2">inadequacies and no shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.059" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">malevolence just like everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.860" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">regardless of that you have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:01.929" style="s2">obligation so that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.690" end="00:26:04.059" style="s2">responsibility to assume that despite</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.929" end="00:26:06.730" style="s2">all evidence that there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.059" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">something of intrinsic worth about you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">and that as a consequence you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:15.940" style="s2">duty-bound to treat yourself like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:19.330" style="s2">is true and then it turns out that if</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.940" end="00:26:22.270" style="s2">you do that well then your life gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.330" end="00:26:24.549" style="s2">better and and I don&#39;t mean happier</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.270" end="00:26:26.770" style="s2">exactly although I would say it gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.549" end="00:26:29.140" style="s2">happier I mean it gets richer and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.770" end="00:26:31.419" style="s2">meaningful and deeper and and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.140" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">worthwhile and and you become more</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.419" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">educated and you become wiser and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:37.330" style="s2">and you treat yourself with more respect</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.370" style="s2">and you&#39;re a better model for other</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:42.100" style="s2">people and you&#39;re a better father or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.370" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">better sister or better mother whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.100" end="00:26:48.940" style="s2">it happens to be it&#39;s and you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.690" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">ridden by that guilt that that gnaws at</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.940" end="00:26:54.789" style="s2">you and shame that&#39;s there otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:56.650" style="s2">saying you&#39;re not what you could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.789" end="00:26:59.260" style="s2">you&#39;re not what you could be and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.650" end="00:27:01.179" style="s2">a hell of a voice to get rid of and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.260" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">certainly not one that&#39;s easy to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.179" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s a pretty good that that idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:09.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s something divine let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:13.090" style="s2">that resides within you of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.280" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">worth even as a philosophical statement</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.090" end="00:27:17.380" style="s2">or a psychological statement rather than</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:20.380" style="s2">a metaphysical statement it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.380" end="00:27:22.419" style="s2">a precondition for establishing properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.380" end="00:27:24.940" style="s2">harmonious relationships with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.419" end="00:27:26.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s man that&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.940" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">thinking about a lot you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.650" end="00:27:30.669" style="s2">have because you think you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.750" end="00:27:33.370" style="s2">think that in some sense you just own</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.669" end="00:27:34.900" style="s2">yourself you know because people do kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.370" end="00:27:36.520" style="s2">of make that claim especially when</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.900" end="00:27:38.919" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to justify for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.520" end="00:27:42.190" style="s2">their right to suicide but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.919" end="00:27:45.400" style="s2">your life it&#39;s your body you&#39;re yours to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.190" end="00:27:47.140" style="s2">do what you will with and if that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.400" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">true well then it would seem to me that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.140" end="00:27:51.280" style="s2">life would be a lot more straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:53.980" style="s2">because you would just tell yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.280" end="00:27:56.230" style="s2">things that you would instantly obey and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.980" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">believe so first of all you tell</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.230" end="00:27:59.080" style="s2">yourself all the things that you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:01.750" style="s2">going to do and then you just run off</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.080" end="00:28:03.430" style="s2">and do them which you don&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.750" end="00:28:04.990" style="s2">obviously because it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.430" end="00:28:07.060" style="s2">difficult at that and then you&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.990" end="00:28:08.890" style="s2">say well enough of the guilt and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.060" end="00:28:10.870" style="s2">shame and the negative emotion and the</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.780" end="00:28:17.890" style="s2">spread the self-recrimination it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:20.140" style="s2">what the hell do we need that for</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.890" end="00:28:22.930" style="s2">and if we&#39;re our masters of our own</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.260" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">can fool yourself for very brief periods</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.310" end="00:28:48.700" style="s2">because they were really the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.600" end="00:28:52.360" style="s2">apart from the religious types who</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.700" end="00:28:55.330" style="s2">figured out that whatever you are you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.360" end="00:28:58.120" style="s2">not a unitary spirit that&#39;s under your</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.120" end="00:29:03.700" style="s2">like a loose unity of a multiplicity of</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">into some form of unity but even that</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.700" end="00:29:19.870" style="s2">have to exist in relationship to and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.040" end="00:29:22.300" style="s2">would also say that that&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.900" end="00:29:46.450" style="s2">think about it that way but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:48.700" style="s2">work like that it&#39;s like the ideal that</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.700" end="00:29:54.580" style="s2">become then sort of manifests itself as</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.110" end="00:30:32.380" style="s2">people think and it isn&#39;t obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.260" end="00:30:33.820" style="s2">we why we think that way that this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.380" end="00:30:35.710" style="s2">part of the reason that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.820" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">so obvious that we have a religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.710" end="00:30:40.360" style="s2">instinct because I can&#39;t think of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.710" style="s2">else you would possibly call that other</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.360" end="00:30:44.110" style="s2">than a religious instinct you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.710" end="00:30:47.010" style="s2">Nietzsche when he proclaimed the death</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.010" end="00:30:51.820" style="s2">triumphant Proclamation because he also</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.780" end="00:30:53.470" style="s2">mentioned that we would never find</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.470" end="00:30:58.810" style="s2">which was his what would you call it</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.810" end="00:31:03.160" style="s2">a very accurate one at that he believed</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.480" end="00:31:05.410" style="s2">that we would in some sense have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.160" end="00:31:08.590" style="s2">become as gods</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.590" end="00:31:13.690" style="s2">replace what we had lost he thought that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.230" end="00:31:15.460" style="s2">that the collapse of the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.690" end="00:31:17.950" style="s2">structure would be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.460" end="00:31:19.900" style="s2">catastrophic for the West and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.950" end="00:31:21.220" style="s2">that he was correct and that the way out</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.900" end="00:31:23.920" style="s2">of that would be that we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.220" end="00:31:26.860" style="s2">create our own values we&#39;d have to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.920" end="00:31:29.590" style="s2">the place of what was once let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.860" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">externalized and divine on to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.590" end="00:31:37.420" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s a hell of a theory and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s not and Nietzsche is not an</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.420" end="00:31:42.190" style="s2">easy person to criticize because you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.330" end="00:31:44.410" style="s2">have to do a lot of reading before you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.190" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">find someone who&#39;s 1/10 as smart as</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.410" end="00:31:48.430" style="s2">Nietzsche he has this funny line about</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">his books</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.430" end="00:31:55.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really quite comical he said takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.690" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">most writers a whole book to write what</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.060" end="00:32:01.300" style="s2">I can write in a sentence then he said</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:04.570" style="s2">no they can&#39;t even manage it in a book</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.300" end="00:32:06.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually true I mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.570" end="00:32:10.120" style="s2">read Nietzsche be one good and evil for</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.310" end="00:32:11.920" style="s2">example you see that that that his his</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.120" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">thought is so powerful that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.920" end="00:32:16.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really a kind of miracle</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:19.080" style="s2">what what the psychoanalyst realized</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.780" end="00:32:21.100" style="s2">though this was particularly Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.080" end="00:32:22.750" style="s2">contribution I would say Carl Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.100" end="00:32:24.700" style="s2">contribution he was a great student of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.750" end="00:32:26.650" style="s2">Nietzsche a real admirer of Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.700" end="00:32:28.630" style="s2">and really someone who is trying to</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.970" end="00:32:38.530" style="s2">structure had collapsed and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.400" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">story upon which our until entire</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.530" end="00:32:43.390" style="s2">culture was based for better or worse it</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">had collapsed and we needed to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.390" end="00:32:46.930" style="s2">something about that and we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">various things we were turning to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.930" end="00:32:54.760" style="s2">fascism let&#39;s say or we were turning to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2">communism both ideological replacements</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.760" end="00:33:00.610" style="s2">for more fundamental religious beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:02.950" style="s2">but that Nietzsche&#39;s suggestion that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.610" end="00:33:06.010" style="s2">turn to ourselves to extract out our own</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.950" end="00:33:07.800" style="s2">values to create our own values let me</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.010" end="00:33:11.380" style="s2">let me be more accurate about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.800" end="00:33:13.030" style="s2">happened to be untrue because we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.380" end="00:33:16.450" style="s2">the sort of creatures who were actually</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.450" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">such what&#39;s one of the reasons I love</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.220" end="00:33:24.010" style="s2">Jung and his is biological take in some</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.180" end="00:37:58.109" style="s2">that was an externalization of our</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:09.780" style="s2">we&#39;re better able to distinguish let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.980" end="00:38:18.900" style="s2">without value because the imagination is</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.940" end="00:41:00.870" style="s2">trying to say is try controlling</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.370" end="00:41:53.490" style="s2">his murder and he gets away with it but</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.490" end="00:41:58.080" style="s2">because one of the things he finds out</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:00.080" style="s2">is that the risk alna carve that you</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.080" end="00:42:04.890" style="s2">not the same as the risk all in the club</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.000" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">as you are after you&#39;ve committed the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.890" end="00:42:10.200" style="s2">murder and there&#39;s a dividing line there</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.290" end="00:42:23.730" style="s2">them there&#39;s no going back and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.080" end="00:42:26.010" style="s2">what crime and punishment is about and</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:49.320" style="s2">thriller as well as being a deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:51.720" style="s2">philosophical book so if you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.320" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">mood for you know a murder mystery</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.720" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">thriller that&#39;s also a deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">philosophical book then that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">for you so now one of the other speakers</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:08.010" style="s2">on the panel van Badham who who who</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:13.770" style="s2">described was described not by me as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.010" end="00:43:16.980" style="s2">writer activist and Twitter Queen which</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.770" end="00:43:19.170" style="s2">is I think like being the Red Queen in</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.980" end="00:43:21.120" style="s2">in Ellis in Wunderland something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.170" end="00:43:23.550" style="s2">that I went on her Twitter site today to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.120" end="00:43:25.860" style="s2">find out how many followers she has but</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.550" end="00:43:28.300" style="s2">apparently I&#39;m not one of them because</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.860" end="00:43:34.110" style="s2">I&#39;m blocked</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.300" end="00:43:37.000" style="s2">and it kind of surprises me because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.110" end="00:43:43.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that I&#39;d ever tried to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.000" end="00:43:46.270" style="s2">follow her but anyways she said and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.660" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">was interesting she said I&#39;m a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.270" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">and a Marxist and I thought no you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:02.230" style="s2">only be a Christian and a Marxist if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">well there&#39;s a couple of ways one is one</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.230" end="00:44:07.990" style="s2">is that you just want to be all things</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:10.120" style="s2">that are good at once regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.990" end="00:44:11.830" style="s2">their internal contradictions and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.120" end="00:44:14.080" style="s2">that would be one reason and another</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.830" end="00:44:16.740" style="s2">reason would be that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.080" end="00:44:20.830" style="s2">anything about Christianity or Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.740" end="00:44:23.110" style="s2">and and and then the next would be that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.830" end="00:44:25.210" style="s2">you&#39;re just compartmentalized you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.110" end="00:44:27.490" style="s2">like there&#39;s this idea that people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.210" end="00:44:31.360" style="s2">hold 2 contradictory thoughts in their</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.490" end="00:44:33.460" style="s2">mind at the same time well that idea was</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.360" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">formulated by someone who who&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.460" end="00:44:38.590" style="s2">met a human being because you can hold</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.930" style="s2">like 50 contradictory thoughts in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.590" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">head at the same time as you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.930" end="00:44:44.860" style="s2">whenever you argue with someone that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.660" style="s2">love because you love them and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.860" end="00:44:48.010" style="s2">even like them but you also hate them</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.660" end="00:44:50.290" style="s2">and you wish that you could just crush</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.010" end="00:44:52.420" style="s2">them right there and then and so like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.290" end="00:44:54.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of contradictory ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.420" end="00:44:55.630" style="s2">that&#39;s probably only like half the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.130" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">contradictory ideas that are running</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.630" end="00:44:59.590" style="s2">through your mind at the moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:01.600" style="s2">so man you&#39;re so full of contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.590" end="00:45:03.700" style="s2">that it&#39;s just beyond belief and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.600" end="00:45:06.970" style="s2">only time I mean I know this because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.700" end="00:45:08.890" style="s2">read undergraduate essays and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.970" end="00:45:11.740" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.890" end="00:45:14.380" style="s2">essays is it&#39;s so interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.740" end="00:45:17.740" style="s2">the undergraduate will make a claim in</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.380" end="00:45:20.530" style="s2">paragraph one and then in paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.740" end="00:45:24.360" style="s2">seven will make the opposite claim and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.530" end="00:45:26.830" style="s2">they won&#39;t notice that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.360" end="00:45:28.840" style="s2">intellectually and commensurate and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.830" end="00:45:32.020" style="s2">know that might happen 30 times in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.840" end="00:45:34.330" style="s2">essay and and the reason that that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.020" end="00:45:37.060" style="s2">works is because well they haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.330" end="00:45:40.120" style="s2">called on paradoxes but also because</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.060" end="00:45:41.590" style="s2">they haven&#39;t had to live the paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.120" end="00:45:43.240" style="s2">through because you</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.590" end="00:45:46.300" style="s2">the only straight note you thought when</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.240" end="00:45:50.440" style="s2">you have like impulse a and impulse B</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.300" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">and they conflict at the same time right</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.440" end="00:45:55.060" style="s2">and you can either do one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:57.910" style="s2">but not both you know if it&#39;s a today</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.060" end="00:45:59.860" style="s2">and B tomorrow well then you can be you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.910" end="00:46:02.500" style="s2">can hold those ideas simultaneously but</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.860" end="00:46:05.080" style="s2">if it&#39;s a or B right now then you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.500" end="00:46:07.150" style="s2">to decide is a more important or is B</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.080" end="00:46:08.830" style="s2">more important you have to put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.150" end="00:46:10.450" style="s2">hierarchy and then you have to act them</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.830" end="00:46:12.580" style="s2">out and you have to see what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:14.530" style="s2">so then you find out if you&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.580" end="00:46:17.080" style="s2">contradictions and part of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.530" end="00:46:19.720" style="s2">you iron out your contradictions which</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.080" end="00:46:21.190" style="s2">is very very hard to do is that you Walt</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.720" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">and you do a whole bunch of things in</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.190" end="00:46:25.120" style="s2">the world like Socrates did you go you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:27.430" style="s2">have your adventure in the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.120" end="00:46:30.340" style="s2">put your ideas to the test and those</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.430" end="00:46:32.170" style="s2">that work out in a paradoxical or</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.340" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">counterproductive manner you dispense</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:35.620" style="s2">with or put lower on the priority list</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.930" style="s2">or something like that and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.620" end="00:46:39.970" style="s2">you discover that you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.930" end="00:46:43.950" style="s2">hold in commensurate views</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.970" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">simultaneously Carl Jung said that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.950" end="00:46:48.460" style="s2">something like paradoxical views that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:51.820" style="s2">are not made conscious will be played</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.460" end="00:46:53.530" style="s2">out in the world as fate and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.820" end="00:46:56.730" style="s2">really worth thinking about too so if</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.530" end="00:46:59.740" style="s2">you have your let&#39;s call it your typical</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.730" end="00:47:01.570" style="s2">negative experience you know this thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.740" end="00:47:04.360" style="s2">that just keeps seems to just keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.570" end="00:47:07.630" style="s2">happening to you bad luck let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.360" end="00:47:11.070" style="s2">it&#39;s highly probable that there&#39;s a set</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.630" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">of ideas that are occupying you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.070" end="00:47:15.610" style="s2">preoccupying you possessing you that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:19.060" style="s2">driving you in this direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.610" end="00:47:22.540" style="s2">continually and that you you can&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.060" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">won&#39;t work out the contradiction and as</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.540" end="00:47:26.830" style="s2">a consequence you know maybe you think</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:28.630" style="s2">every woman is your mother and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.830" end="00:47:31.390" style="s2">haven&#39;t noticed that you think that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.630" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">that that you know and it is something</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.390" end="00:47:36.190" style="s2">that people think because women are</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.640" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">mothers are women and it&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.190" end="00:47:41.470" style="s2">initial template but you know you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:44.080" style="s2">you gotta modify it to some degree and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.470" end="00:47:45.820" style="s2">you know if that&#39;s an unconscious idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.080" end="00:47:48.450" style="s2">that you have and you continue to play</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.820" end="00:47:51.220" style="s2">it out you may run into your continual</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.450" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">habitual negative experience with women</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.220" end="00:47:55.980" style="s2">and you wonder what the hell is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:58.490" style="s2">with women but there it isn&#39;t the women</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.980" end="00:48:00.750" style="s2">that has the problem it&#39;s you and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.490" end="00:48:03.150" style="s2">you know if you run into problems with</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.750" end="00:48:05.640" style="s2">women all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.150" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">then it&#39;s highly probable that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.640" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">problem is you so not always but</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:16.380" style="s2">generally so let&#39;s go into this Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.840" style="s2">and Christian idea here just for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.380" end="00:48:21.300" style="s2">minute so Oh we&#39;ll start with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.840" end="00:48:23.460" style="s2">start with some of the ideas of Marx</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.300" end="00:48:26.010" style="s2">well Marx believed that people were</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.460" end="00:48:29.490" style="s2">basically socially constructed so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.010" end="00:48:32.190" style="s2">we were blank slates and that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.490" end="00:48:34.980" style="s2">our nature was was given to us</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:35.880" style="s2">are then they&#39;re not just different like</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.880" end="00:56:42.070" style="s2">variant one invariant - these are like</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.530" end="00:56:44.380" style="s2">seriously different ideas and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.070" end="00:56:46.810" style="s2">another reason you can&#39;t be a Marxist in</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.380" end="00:56:48.520" style="s2">a Christian as if you and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.810" end="00:56:50.770" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.520" end="00:56:53.380" style="s2">you know that marks had that religion</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.770" end="00:56:55.630" style="s2">was the opiate of the masses which</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.380" end="00:56:57.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exactly sound like I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.630" end="00:57:02.010" style="s2">thought religion was the opiate of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.490" end="00:57:06.610" style="s2">masses but communism Marxism was the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.010" end="00:57:10.780" style="s2">methamphetamine of the of the masses</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.610" end="00:57:13.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say yeah the meth of the masses we</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.780" end="00:57:14.800" style="s2">we had no idea with regards to opiates</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.420" end="00:57:17.080" style="s2">so here&#39;s what Marx has to say about</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.800" end="00:57:20.110" style="s2">religion the abolition of religion as</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.080" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">the illusory happiness of the people is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.110" end="00:57:25.270" style="s2">the demand for the real happiness to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:28.540" style="s2">call on them to give up their illusions</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.270" end="00:57:30.280" style="s2">about their condition is to call on them</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.540" end="00:57:32.470" style="s2">to give up a condition that requires</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.280" end="00:57:34.540" style="s2">illusions it&#39;s interesting to me because</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.470" end="00:57:37.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the judeo-christian story</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.540" end="00:57:39.010" style="s2">was really a happy one as far as far as</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.510" end="00:57:41.230" style="s2">I can tell you know I mean there was</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.010" end="00:57:45.340" style="s2">heaven but Genesis II you were gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.230" end="00:57:48.730" style="s2">in man that was low and and and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.340" end="00:57:51.250" style="s2">it was a fair bit of original sin you</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.730" end="00:57:53.650" style="s2">know and a fair bit of you wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.250" end="00:57:56.320" style="s2">with all of your inadequacies and your</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.650" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2">proclivity towards malevolence to pick</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.320" end="00:58:00.369" style="s2">up your cross to bear your suffering to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.450" end="00:58:02.590" style="s2">understand that you know there is a war</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.369" end="00:58:05.140" style="s2">in your soul between the forces of good</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.590" end="00:58:07.150" style="s2">and evil it&#39;s like how that&#39;s an opiate</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.140" end="00:58:09.340" style="s2">is beyond me I mean if I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.150" end="00:58:10.900" style="s2">design an opiate that made people feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.340" end="00:58:13.090" style="s2">better I&#39;d certainly dispense with a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.900" end="00:58:14.859" style="s2">fair bit of that it&#39;s like whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.090" end="00:58:17.109" style="s2">do is okay we could start with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.859" end="00:58:18.760" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly no hell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.109" end="00:58:20.890" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna get rid of right</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.760" end="00:58:22.600" style="s2">away little less guilt and shame would</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.890" end="00:58:24.609" style="s2">be it could be like a hippie cult in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.600" end="00:58:26.800" style="s2">1960s you know with a little more</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.609" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">marijuana and some free sex something</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.800" end="00:58:32.790" style="s2">something like that so I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.960" end="00:58:35.109" style="s2">understand the illusion idea there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.790" end="00:58:36.970" style="s2">Marxist criticism I suppose of the</p>

<p begin="00:58:43.690" end="00:58:47.380" style="s2">sort of still kind of a nightmarish</p>

<p begin="01:00:13.630" end="01:00:18.400" style="s2">something that you should be revolving</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.980" end="01:00:20.980" style="s2">around that isn&#39;t just yourself you know</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.539" end="01:00:26.680" style="s2">love that that would be a start could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.220" end="01:00:29.380" style="s2">a child could be your your partner in</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.380" end="01:00:33.789" style="s2">in extension could be your community it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.989" end="01:00:35.769" style="s2">could be some noble ideal that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.789" end="01:00:39.849" style="s2">trying to serve should be something</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.519" end="01:00:47.289" style="s2">presumably everything else revolves so I</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.289" end="01:00:52.890" style="s2">wise what would you call it philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:55.839" style="s2">and as it manifested itself in the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.890" end="01:00:57.489" style="s2">you know I would say Stalin probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.839" end="01:01:00.940" style="s2">revolved around himself quite nicely</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.489" end="01:01:03.249" style="s2">since and don&#39;t you think I mean if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.940" end="01:01:05.950" style="s2">had to pick someone who was revolving</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.249" end="01:01:07.869" style="s2">around himself it would be a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.950" end="01:01:10.869" style="s2">decent competition between Mao and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.869" end="01:01:13.029" style="s2">Stalin and-and-and that didn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.869" end="01:01:14.980" style="s2">be that didn&#39;t seem to be for the best</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.029" end="01:01:16.150" style="s2">so so that&#39;s something to consider as</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.980" end="01:01:18.220" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.150" end="01:01:20.380" style="s2">the Marxists believed that religion</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.220" end="01:01:22.630" style="s2">hindered human development and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.380" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">Soviets and the Maoists instituted state</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.630" end="01:01:27.670" style="s2">atheism apart from the worship of their</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:29.740" style="s2">leaders of course and then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.670" end="01:01:33.250" style="s2">read you a poem by Marx this is a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.740" end="01:01:36.580" style="s2">one I found this a while back god it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.250" end="01:01:38.619" style="s2">rough poem and you know you want it you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.580" end="01:01:41.470" style="s2">want to let your imagination sort of I</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.619" end="01:01:43.660" style="s2">would say let your imagination loose</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.470" end="01:01:45.970" style="s2">with with this poem which is what you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.660" end="01:01:47.590" style="s2">should do with the poem and imagine the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.970" end="01:01:49.840" style="s2">sort of state of mind that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.590" end="01:01:52.690" style="s2">be in to write a poem like this and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.840" end="01:01:55.150" style="s2">also imagine as you should that poetry</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.690" end="01:01:57.400" style="s2">like dreams are the birth its birthplace</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.150" end="01:01:59.170" style="s2">of thought with my undergraduates often</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.400" end="01:02:02.200" style="s2">especially ones that are really obsessed</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.170" end="01:02:05.619" style="s2">with ideas they&#39;ll often put really bad</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.200" end="01:02:08.109" style="s2">poetry in their essays and and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.619" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">saying that in a in a cynical way</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.109" end="01:02:12.430" style="s2">because bad poetry can have good ideas</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:15.220" style="s2">in it it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to write good</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.430" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">poetry you know but the thing is often</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.220" end="01:02:20.920" style="s2">an idea that&#39;s extraordinarily emotional</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:22.930" style="s2">in content will manifest itself as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.920" end="01:02:25.240" style="s2">poem before it is able to articulate</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.930" end="01:02:27.490" style="s2">itself out into a fully expressed</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.240" end="01:02:28.839" style="s2">philosophy and so I see this with my</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.490" end="01:02:30.490" style="s2">undergraduates they&#39;ll really be</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.839" end="01:02:32.380" style="s2">obsessed with something that&#39;s bothering</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.490" end="01:02:34.030" style="s2">them then the rights of some poem often</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.380" end="01:02:36.339" style="s2">about a personal experience and then as</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.030" end="01:02:39.490" style="s2">I help them shape the essay they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.339" end="01:02:40.930" style="s2">unfold the poem into an articulated</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.490" end="01:02:43.930" style="s2">statement about the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.930" end="01:02:46.150" style="s2">and so you could say well you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.930" end="01:02:48.430" style="s2">all embedded in the dream we know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.150" end="01:02:49.869" style="s2">you go to sleep every night and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.430" end="01:02:52.210" style="s2">dream you&#39;re embedded in your</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.869" end="01:02:55.359" style="s2">imagination if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.210" end="01:02:57.730" style="s2">forbidden to dream if you&#39;re deprived of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.359" end="01:03:00.040" style="s2">your dreams you will lose your mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.730" end="01:03:02.589" style="s2">that&#39;s been experimentally demonstrated</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.040" end="01:03:05.050" style="s2">quite nicely on animals but also on</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.589" end="01:03:08.260" style="s2">human beings you have to dream you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.050" end="01:03:10.450" style="s2">to enter that that realm of incoherent</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.260" end="01:03:11.800" style="s2">imagination and possibility in order to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.450" end="01:03:13.420" style="s2">maintain your sanity which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.800" end="01:03:16.060" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting and very</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.420" end="01:03:19.300" style="s2">strange and I would say poetry exists on</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.060" end="01:03:21.670" style="s2">the border between the dream and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.300" end="01:03:24.070" style="s2">fully articulate wakefulness it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.670" end="01:03:27.070" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the place where the image</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.070" end="01:03:29.740" style="s2">of the dream meets the meets the meets</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.070" end="01:03:32.290" style="s2">the meets the articulated speech</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.740" end="01:03:35.369" style="s2">full consciousness and so you can think</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.290" end="01:03:41.110" style="s2">about that with regards to this poem</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.369" end="01:03:45.790" style="s2">invocation of one in despair so a God</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.110" end="01:03:49.510" style="s2">has snatched from me all my all in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:58.750" end="01:04:06.400" style="s2">I&#39;ll proudly wreak on that being that</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.600" end="01:05:09.160" style="s2">them up defiant well I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.359" end="01:05:13.900" style="s2">the sort of poem that would be written</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.160" end="01:05:17.980" style="s2">by someone who revolved around himself</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.900" end="01:05:20.230" style="s2">as his own true son and I would also say</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.980" end="01:05:22.470" style="s2">that given what we know about what</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.230" end="01:05:25.330" style="s2">happened as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.470" end="01:05:28.300" style="s2">instantiation of Marxist doctrine that</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.330" end="01:05:31.660" style="s2">this is a truly horrifying piece of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.300" end="01:05:35.050" style="s2">literature to contemplate written by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.660" end="01:05:38.260" style="s2">way when Marx was rather young so then</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.050" end="01:05:42.950" style="s2">the question came to me do I believe in</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.260" end="01:05:45.619" style="s2">God and I don&#39;t like that question</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.950" end="01:05:47.630" style="s2">and people have complained at me a lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.619" end="01:05:49.820" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure they have the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.630" end="01:05:53.089" style="s2">because they don&#39;t like my answers you</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.820" end="01:05:54.829" style="s2">know and I have two answers they&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.089" end="01:05:57.349" style="s2">of become stalk which is not a good</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.829" end="01:06:04.430" style="s2">thing but but they&#39;re the best</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.349" end="01:06:08.270" style="s2">approximate exactly I&#39;ve got three I had</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.430" end="01:06:10.150" style="s2">three sort of burgeoning hypotheses one</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.270" end="01:06:12.500" style="s2">was it&#39;s none of your damn business</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.150" end="01:06:14.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the first one so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.500" end="01:06:16.369" style="s2">privacy issue like it seemed to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.510" end="01:06:20.150" style="s2">a question that was too private to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.369" end="01:06:21.829" style="s2">answered properly and so and you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.150" end="01:06:25.630" style="s2">you could consider that a cop-out and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.829" end="01:06:29.690" style="s2">maybe it is and then another one was</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.630" end="01:06:32.540" style="s2">well what do you mean by believe like do</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.690" end="01:06:35.089" style="s2">you mean the words do you mean to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.540" end="01:06:36.859" style="s2">the words I believe in God does that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.089" end="01:06:38.180" style="s2">indicate that you believe in God like I</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.859" end="01:06:41.089" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you mean by believe</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.180" end="01:06:42.890" style="s2">exactly because and that&#39;s got me in</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.089" end="01:06:44.630" style="s2">trouble too because you know people</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.890" end="01:06:46.579" style="s2">think that attempting to clarify the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.630" end="01:06:48.410" style="s2">meaning of words is an attempt to escape</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.579" end="01:06:50.180" style="s2">from the question when it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.410" end="01:06:53.359" style="s2">attempt to specify the question I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.180" end="01:06:56.480" style="s2">is what you believe what you say or what</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.359" end="01:06:58.700" style="s2">you act out now you know I would say to</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.480" end="01:07:00.980" style="s2">some degree it&#39;s both but if push comes</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.700" end="01:07:02.900" style="s2">to shove as far as I&#39;m concerned what</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.980" end="01:07:04.819" style="s2">you believe is what you act out not what</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.900" end="01:07:06.619" style="s2">you say and then you know and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.819" end="01:07:08.839" style="s2">an integrated person then what you act</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.619" end="01:07:11.690" style="s2">out and what you say are the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.839" end="01:07:14.180" style="s2">and then you&#39;re a person whose word can</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.690" end="01:07:16.099" style="s2">be trusted right because what you say</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.180" end="01:07:18.950" style="s2">and what you do are isomorphic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.099" end="01:07:22.869" style="s2">the same thing but belief is</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.950" end="01:07:27.020" style="s2">instantiated in action so I have also</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.869" end="01:07:30.069" style="s2">suggested that I act as if I believe in</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.020" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">God or to the best of my ability and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.069" end="01:07:34.310" style="s2">people aren&#39;t very happy with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:37.849" style="s2">either but and then the third is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.310" end="01:07:39.619" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid that he might exist which i</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.849" end="01:07:41.690" style="s2">think is the most comical of the three</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.619" end="01:07:45.650" style="s2">answers and perhaps the most accurate</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.690" end="01:07:47.390" style="s2">one but then but then I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.650" end="01:07:48.619" style="s2">about this today when I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.390" end="01:07:50.630" style="s2">about what I might talk to you guys</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.619" end="01:07:54.349" style="s2">about and I thought well let&#39;s go into</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.630" end="01:07:56.210" style="s2">this a little bit more let&#39;s say you say</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.349" end="01:08:00.049" style="s2">you do believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.210" end="01:08:02.119" style="s2">say I believe in God it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.049" end="01:08:04.609" style="s2">that&#39;s hypothetically pretty impressive</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.119" end="01:08:07.940" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s like you believe that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.609" end="01:08:10.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a divine power that oversees</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.940" end="01:08:11.930" style="s2">everything that is fundamentally ethical</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.250" end="01:08:16.370" style="s2">that&#39;s watching everything you do and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.930" end="01:08:19.250" style="s2">and you believe that and so what effect</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.370" end="01:08:23.380" style="s2">does that have on your behavior if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.250" end="01:08:26.359" style="s2">believe it does that mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.380" end="01:08:29.509" style="s2">well are you --fill are you all-in on</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.359" end="01:08:31.819" style="s2">your beliefs are you sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.509" end="01:08:34.330" style="s2">everything to this transcendent entity</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.819" end="01:08:37.400" style="s2">that you proclaim belief in have you</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.330" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">cleansed yourself of all your sin let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.909" end="01:08:57.580" style="s2">bring that up since the Pope seems to be</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.580" end="01:09:04.190" style="s2">with the Catholic Church given the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:06.529" style="s2">endless pedophilic scandals let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.190" end="01:09:08.810" style="s2">which seem rather serious in my</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.529" end="01:09:13.460" style="s2">estimation and might have been something</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.810" end="01:09:16.130" style="s2">that was cleaned up perhaps a hundred or</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.460" end="01:09:19.310" style="s2">a thousand years ago and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.130" end="01:09:20.900" style="s2">taken seriously perhaps now and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.310" end="01:09:22.909" style="s2">not because it&#39;s not so easy to</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.900" end="01:09:25.250" style="s2">determine exactly what it would mean to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.909" end="01:09:26.870" style="s2">take that seriously and you might say</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.250" end="01:09:29.299" style="s2">well are all the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.870" end="01:09:32.150" style="s2">committing these highness actions and</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.299" end="01:09:34.670" style="s2">then covering them up or if you ask them</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.150" end="01:09:37.460" style="s2">well do you believe in God what are they</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.670" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">going to say well you&#39;d think the answer</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.460" end="01:09:49.190" style="s2">would be yes given that they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:52.549" style="s2">priests and and yet and yet what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.190" end="01:09:56.449" style="s2">evidence well the evidence isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.549" end="01:09:58.219" style="s2">so clear that the mere statement let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.449" end="01:10:00.949" style="s2">say or the mirror acting out of the</p>

<p begin="01:10:02.750" end="01:10:08.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m pointing out that that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.940" end="01:10:09.170" style="s2">indication of your right to say that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.210" end="01:10:10.820" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.170" end="01:10:12.440" style="s2">because you got it and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.820" end="01:10:14.330" style="s2">why it&#39;s more than me to answer this</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.440" end="01:10:17.000" style="s2">question it&#39;s like what right do I have</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.330" end="01:10:18.830" style="s2">to say that to make that claim I believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.000" end="01:10:20.500" style="s2">in God well what&#39;s the claim is that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.830" end="01:10:22.520" style="s2">claim that I&#39;m a good person somehow</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.500" end="01:10:28.489" style="s2">because you think that if you believed</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.520" end="01:10:31.100" style="s2">in God actually like like seriously that</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.489" end="01:10:35.270" style="s2">you&#39;d be a good person like right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.100" end="01:10:37.640" style="s2">because well for obvious reasons I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.270" end="01:10:40.160" style="s2">think and so if that hasn&#39;t happened in</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.640" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">some sort of miraculous sense so that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.160" end="01:10:43.969" style="s2">you&#39;re the best person you could</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:47.630" style="s2">possibly imagine being on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.969" end="01:10:50.420" style="s2">basis and then terrified of of deviating</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.630" end="01:10:52.760" style="s2">from that path in a serious manner then</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.420" end="01:10:54.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t see why you have the right to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.760" end="01:10:56.030" style="s2">say that you believe in God you know one</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.830" end="01:10:57.590" style="s2">of the things Nietzsche said about</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.030" end="01:11:00.020" style="s2">Christianity it was a great critic of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.590" end="01:11:03.170" style="s2">Christianity although also a great</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.020" end="01:11:05.150" style="s2">friend in a very peculiar way in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.170" end="01:11:09.230" style="s2">sometimes your best friend is the one</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.150" end="01:11:11.150" style="s2">who points out your weakest properties</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.230" end="01:11:13.100" style="s2">let&#39;s say he said as far as he was</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.150" end="01:11:15.530" style="s2">concerned there was only one Christian</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.100" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">and he died on the cross and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.530" end="01:11:19.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a you know perhaps an extreme</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:21.770" style="s2">statement but one worth giving some</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.550" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">consideration to it&#39;s like well then you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.770" end="01:11:26.330" style="s2">look at what if what are you called upon</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:28.850" style="s2">let&#39;s say if you&#39;re going to proclaim</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.330" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">yourself as a believer you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.850" end="01:11:32.570" style="s2">thought about this a lot as I&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:34.550" style="s2">through the Old Testament I did a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.570" end="01:11:36.650" style="s2">of lectures last year and so what do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.550" end="01:11:40.969" style="s2">called upon well you&#39;re called upon</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.650" end="01:11:42.469" style="s2">initially to act out the spark of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.969" end="01:11:45.739" style="s2">divinity that&#39;s within you by</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.469" end="01:11:48.670" style="s2">confronting potential with the logos</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.739" end="01:11:51.320" style="s2">that&#39;s within you which means to take</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.670" end="01:11:53.960" style="s2">the opportunities that are in front of</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.320" end="01:11:56.090" style="s2">you the potential future and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.960" end="01:11:59.120" style="s2">transform it into the present in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.090" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">best possible way using truth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:07.580" style="s2">courage and careful articulation as your</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:08.929" style="s2">as your as your as your as your guide so</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.580" end="01:12:12.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re called on</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.929" end="01:12:14.750" style="s2">to do now that&#39;s a major deal there</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.230" end="01:12:16.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough one and then the second</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.750" end="01:12:19.730" style="s2">is to make the proper sacrifices that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.820" end="01:12:22.010" style="s2">the Cain and Abel story is like you you</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.730" end="01:12:22.650" style="s2">want something you genuinely want it you</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.010" end="01:12:24.300" style="s2">want to set the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.650" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">world straight than you let go of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.300" end="01:12:29.130" style="s2">necessary and you pursue you let go of</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:31.710" style="s2">what isn&#39;t necessary no matter what it</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.130" end="01:12:33.840" style="s2">is no matter what it is and then you</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.710" end="01:12:36.060" style="s2">pursue what&#39;s necessary and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.840" end="01:12:39.420" style="s2">you sacrifice your children to God that</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.060" end="01:12:41.159" style="s2">that was the story that&#39;s the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.420" end="01:12:42.210" style="s2">next stories that comes up of course and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.159" end="01:12:44.280" style="s2">you think well that&#39;s pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.210" end="01:12:47.640" style="s2">barbaric and the way the story&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.280" end="01:12:49.890" style="s2">out of course it is but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.640" end="01:12:51.630" style="s2">exactly what it means it means that what</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.890" end="01:12:53.659" style="s2">you try to do when you raise children is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.630" end="01:12:57.300" style="s2">that you try to do everything you can to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.659" end="01:12:59.640" style="s2">impress upon them by imitation and by</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.300" end="01:13:02.810" style="s2">instruction and by love and by</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.640" end="01:13:06.570" style="s2">encouragement that they are crucial</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.810" end="01:13:08.610" style="s2">beings in the world whose ethical</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.570" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">decisions play an important role in</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.610" end="01:13:11.850" style="s2">shaping the structure of reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:14.040" style="s2">and that they have the moral</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.850" end="01:13:17.070" style="s2">responsibility to do that and you get</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.040" end="01:13:19.320" style="s2">your Ark in order that&#39;s your family</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.070" end="01:13:22.050" style="s2">let&#39;s say so that when the storms come</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.320" end="01:13:24.090" style="s2">you can stay above water for the 40 days</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.050" end="01:13:25.920" style="s2">of flooding and you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.090" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">leading your people through the desert</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.920" end="01:13:30.810" style="s2">when the desert makes itself manifest</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:32.640" style="s2">and you can escape from tyranny properly</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.810" end="01:13:35.370" style="s2">because you&#39;re wise enough to see it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.640" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">you take the full burden of being on</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.370" end="01:13:39.780" style="s2">yourself all the suffering that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:42.690" style="s2">part and parcel of that you accept that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.780" end="01:13:44.370" style="s2">voluntarily let&#39;s say and you do</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.690" end="01:13:45.989" style="s2">everything you can to confront the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.370" end="01:13:47.640" style="s2">malevolence that&#39;s part of you and</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.989" end="01:13:50.699" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the state and it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.640" end="01:13:53.280" style="s2">of the world and you you you make a</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.699" end="01:13:55.830" style="s2">garden around you that&#39;s the paradise a</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.280" end="01:13:57.420" style="s2">walled garden it&#39;s a walled well watered</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.830" end="01:14:00.030" style="s2">place so the forces of nature and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.420" end="01:14:01.770" style="s2">society exist together in harmony and</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.030" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">you place your family in that so that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.770" end="01:14:06.420" style="s2">they can live properly and you treat</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.080" end="01:14:09.929" style="s2">your enemy as if he&#39;s yourself and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.420" end="01:14:15.300" style="s2">same with your brother and well then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.929" end="01:14:18.540" style="s2">can say then maybe you can say maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.300" end="01:14:23.400" style="s2">then you have the right to say that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.540" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">believe in God otherwise maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.400" end="01:14:30.330" style="s2">should think twice about it because you</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:32.460" style="s2">know there&#39;s a line in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.330" end="01:14:33.719" style="s2">that Christ Himself says two of them I</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.460" end="01:14:36.330" style="s2">should read them two because there are</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.900" end="01:14:47.760" style="s2">comes up to Christ and says and and says</p>

<p begin="01:14:49.710" end="01:14:54.210" style="s2">should be a good person and Christ says</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.010" end="01:16:49.140" style="s2">was a fascinating thing to do was the</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.070" end="01:16:50.219" style="s2">story of Jacob who became Israel and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.140" end="01:16:52.340" style="s2">Jacob was a real</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.219" end="01:16:56.219" style="s2">you know he was a morally ambiguous</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.340" end="01:16:59.340" style="s2">figure to put it mildly and he tricked</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.219" end="01:17:01.530" style="s2">his older brother out of his birthright</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.340" end="01:17:02.910" style="s2">and he was full of tricks and he had a</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.530" end="01:17:04.469" style="s2">lot of tricks played on him too and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.910" end="01:17:07.770" style="s2">maybe learned something as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.469" end="01:17:09.600" style="s2">anyways after running away from his</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.770" end="01:17:11.640" style="s2">brother who had murderous thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.600" end="01:17:14.460" style="s2">for good reasons for I liked about 20</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.640" end="01:17:16.830" style="s2">years maybe it was only 14 but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.460" end="01:17:18.510" style="s2">matter it was a long time he decided</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.830" end="01:17:21.000" style="s2">that he would go back and try to make</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.510" end="01:17:23.100" style="s2">peace and he came to this river he sent</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.000" end="01:17:26.370" style="s2">his family across the river along with</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.100" end="01:17:28.620" style="s2">his belongings um and and partly as an</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.370" end="01:17:31.860" style="s2">offering to his brother a peace offering</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.620" end="01:17:35.250" style="s2">and he had a dream dream visionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.860" end="01:17:37.550" style="s2">experience hallucination God who knows</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.250" end="01:17:40.830" style="s2">what it was and he dreamt that he</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.550" end="01:17:46.040" style="s2">wrestled with an angel all night and</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.830" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">that the angel was God and God he won</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.040" end="01:17:52.320" style="s2">which is very strange because well first</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.920" end="01:17:55.650" style="s2">of all he was a trickster figure you</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.320" end="01:17:58.469" style="s2">know like he wasn&#39;t your most upstanding</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.650" end="01:18:01.980" style="s2">moral creature he wasn&#39;t Noah for</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.469" end="01:18:03.989" style="s2">example and second well it was God you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.980" end="01:18:08.940" style="s2">know it&#39;s like figure to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.989" end="01:18:12.150" style="s2">someone and lose there&#39;s an opponent</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.940" end="01:18:15.989" style="s2">that&#39;s likely to take you out and he did</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.150" end="01:18:17.880" style="s2">damage his hip him so what not that</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.989" end="01:18:23.070" style="s2">impressive an accomplishment on thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.880" end="01:18:25.530" style="s2">pardon my estimation but but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.070" end="01:18:27.300" style="s2">interesting story because what it does</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.530" end="01:18:29.460" style="s2">indicate what&#39;s so cool about it you see</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.300" end="01:18:32.130" style="s2">Jacobs name is changed at that point to</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.460" end="01:18:35.160" style="s2">Israel and Israel means those who</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.130" end="01:18:37.170" style="s2">wrestle with God and then that&#39;s so that</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.160" end="01:18:38.880" style="s2">blue meal is one of the things I love</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.170" end="01:18:40.770" style="s2">about studying old stories is now and</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.880" end="01:18:43.469" style="s2">then you come across a piece of one and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.770" end="01:18:46.290" style="s2">you and you see in it into it you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.469" end="01:18:48.180" style="s2">you see down into the depths that that</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.290" end="01:18:51.780" style="s2">characterizes it&#39;s very difficult but</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.180" end="01:18:55.380" style="s2">happens sometimes and it just flattens</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.780" end="01:18:57.630" style="s2">you you know to think that if Israel is</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.380" end="01:18:59.910" style="s2">that is the chore if Israel is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.630" end="01:19:02.730" style="s2">chosen people of God that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.910" end="01:19:03.250" style="s2">hypothesis and what Israel means is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.730" end="01:19:05.320" style="s2">those who</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.250" end="01:19:07.150" style="s2">wrestle with God then think that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.320" end="01:19:10.090" style="s2">gives that seems to me to be such a</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.150" end="01:19:13.240" style="s2">hopeful idea because well everyone does</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.090" end="01:19:15.490" style="s2">that to some degree I mean you do that</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.240" end="01:19:18.760" style="s2">in your life because well you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.490" end="01:19:20.470" style="s2">what&#39;s a fundamental transcendent worth</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.760" end="01:19:22.150" style="s2">you know because who the hell are you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.470" end="01:19:25.510" style="s2">and what do you know you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.150" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">you&#39;re struggling all the time with well</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.510" end="01:19:28.780" style="s2">I would say with good and evil when</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:30.940" style="s2">you&#39;re struggling with yourself you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.780" end="01:19:32.640" style="s2">struggling with the world to to to</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.940" end="01:19:35.110" style="s2">portray that as wrestling with God</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.640" end="01:19:38.890" style="s2">that&#39;s perfectly reasonable from a</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.110" end="01:19:41.380" style="s2">metaphoric perspective and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.890" end="01:19:44.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what characterizes the true</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.380" end="01:19:47.020" style="s2">people of God is that willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.500" end="01:19:50.590" style="s2">wrestle that&#39;s really something because</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.020" end="01:19:52.900" style="s2">it kind of indicates that you&#39;re here as</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.590" end="01:19:54.280" style="s2">a contender you know you&#39;re not here to</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.900" end="01:19:56.110" style="s2">be happy you&#39;re not here to be</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.110" end="01:20:01.000" style="s2">materially satisfied not that that would</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.780" end="01:20:03.090" style="s2">be possible anyways but that you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.000" end="01:20:05.550" style="s2">to contend with the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.090" end="01:20:08.380" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what&#39;ll satisfy you</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.550" end="01:20:11.050" style="s2">because there&#39;s something to you you</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.380" end="01:20:12.730" style="s2">know you&#39;re not weak and nothing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.050" end="01:20:14.860" style="s2">something to you there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.730" end="01:20:16.510" style="s2">something malevolent and terrible I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.860" end="01:20:18.910" style="s2">you know that you look at how people</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.510" end="01:20:21.310" style="s2">behave you you look at the blood and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.910" end="01:20:23.950" style="s2">catastrophe of our history you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.310" end="01:20:26.710" style="s2">certainly see though the absolute the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.950" end="01:20:28.510" style="s2">absolute hellish depths of the human</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.710" end="01:20:30.610" style="s2">soul but there&#39;s there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.510" end="01:20:33.370" style="s2">takes root in that and grows up out of</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.610" end="01:20:36.820" style="s2">that it&#39;s absolutely magnificent beyond</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.370" end="01:20:39.580" style="s2">belief and that&#39;s looking for for to</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.820" end="01:20:42.520" style="s2">contend you know and I&#39;ve often thought</p>

<p begin="01:20:42.520" end="01:20:46.930" style="s2">because you think well you got you get</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.580" end="01:20:49.650" style="s2">married and you live happily ever after</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.930" end="01:20:49.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.860" end="01:21:01.210" style="s2">we want your partner to do just all</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.780" end="01:21:03.190" style="s2">she&#39;s gonna do is sprinkle rose petals</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.210" end="01:21:04.420" style="s2">in front of you right and pat you on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.190" end="01:21:06.940" style="s2">back of the head and tell you how</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.420" end="01:21:10.120" style="s2">wonderful you are constantly day after</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.940" end="01:21:13.510" style="s2">day man you&#39;d be so sick of that after -</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.120" end="01:21:15.580" style="s2">well maybe take a month but but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.510" end="01:21:18.880" style="s2">say two weeks it&#39;d be you you&#39;d be cuz</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.580" end="01:21:22.090" style="s2">you know she should be more on the side</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.880" end="01:21:25.450" style="s2">of who you could be than on the side of</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.090" end="01:21:29.020" style="s2">who you are and if she&#39;s deluded enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.450" end="01:21:31.930" style="s2">or terrified enough to worship you in</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.020" end="01:21:34.690" style="s2">your current form then well that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.930" end="01:21:36.850" style="s2">say much for her and it certainly isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.690" end="01:21:39.940" style="s2">very helpful for you you want someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.850" end="01:21:42.700" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna get in the way now and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.940" end="01:21:44.500" style="s2">you know and and to contend with and</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.700" end="01:21:46.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve been fortunate in my marriage</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.500" end="01:21:49.150" style="s2">because I have someone to contend with</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.120" end="01:21:51.580" style="s2">you know we we have our our discussions</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.150" end="01:21:53.140" style="s2">and they&#39;re not easy involved but partly</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.580" end="01:21:54.820" style="s2">because we have hard problems to solve</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.140" end="01:21:57.670" style="s2">because life is full of hard problems I</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.820" end="01:22:00.940" style="s2">want someone who stand up you know and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.670" end="01:22:03.430" style="s2">and have her say even if it&#39;s not what I</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.940" end="01:22:06.700" style="s2">would say and maybe I&#39;m even willing at</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.430" end="01:22:09.220" style="s2">times because she&#39;s quite intuitive and</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.700" end="01:22:12.010" style="s2">a good dreamer and I&#39;m more facile</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.220" end="01:22:13.930" style="s2">verbally and so we have to be careful in</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.010" end="01:22:16.450" style="s2">our relationship because if I&#39;m in a</p>

<p begin="01:22:57.160" end="01:23:02.030" style="s2">and so what do you want well you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.450" end="01:23:04.040" style="s2">someone to contend with and then it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.030" end="01:23:06.260" style="s2">adventure you know and then you have</p>

<p begin="01:23:06.260" end="01:23:11.239" style="s2">respect and that&#39;s not a bad combination</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.690" end="01:23:13.370" style="s2">for longevity of relationship and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.239" end="01:23:15.110" style="s2">maybe if you have someone that you love</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.370" end="01:23:17.270" style="s2">and respect and that you can communicate</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.110" end="01:23:19.520" style="s2">with and your children also love and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.270" end="01:23:21.350" style="s2">respect her or him and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.520" end="01:23:22.910" style="s2">pretty good for them because they&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="01:23:26.090" end="01:23:31.130" style="s2">know it solidifies their life and so you</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.330" end="01:23:33.770" style="s2">want to contend with them and you want a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.130" end="01:23:35.720" style="s2">job that&#39;s challenging I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.770" end="01:23:38.690" style="s2">pushes you beyond what you already are</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.720" end="01:23:41.270" style="s2">and god only knows how much how hard you</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.690" end="01:23:43.130" style="s2">need to be pushed in order to go beyond</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.270" end="01:23:46.940" style="s2">where you are but you know to some</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.130" end="01:23:50.210" style="s2">degree if you have a choice you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.940" end="01:23:52.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not that uncommon that what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.210" end="01:23:54.230" style="s2">do is choose to be pushed to the limit</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.130" end="01:23:56.300" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re at our best we</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.230" end="01:23:58.100" style="s2">think well where&#39;s the limit it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.300" end="01:24:00.230" style="s2">maybe I can manage that I&#39;m gonna push</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.100" end="01:24:02.210" style="s2">myself right to the damn limit then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.230" end="01:24:04.489" style="s2">gonna push myself a little bit over just</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.210" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">to see if it&#39;s possible and and if that</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.489" end="01:24:09.470" style="s2">happens then you know you emerge with a</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:11.750" style="s2">sense of of triumph I&#39;m now more than I</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.470" end="01:24:13.970" style="s2">was right and maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.750" end="01:24:16.760" style="s2">here to be is to be more than you were</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.970" end="01:24:18.739" style="s2">trying to push those limits and to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.760" end="01:24:19.700" style="s2">that you contend with the world you</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.739" end="01:24:22.910" style="s2">wrestle with God</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.700" end="01:24:26.810" style="s2">you don&#39;t casually say I believe because</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.910" end="01:24:29.480" style="s2">who knows no one no one knows right</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.810" end="01:24:33.080" style="s2">we&#39;re separated from the infinite by</p>

<p begin="01:24:33.080" end="01:24:38.600" style="s2">contend we wrestle you know and in that</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.989" end="01:24:40.340" style="s2">maybe we find our destiny at least we</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.600" end="01:24:43.489" style="s2">find our purpose we find something</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.340" end="01:24:46.790" style="s2">that&#39;s that that justifies us to some</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.489" end="01:24:48.739" style="s2">degree you know if I&#39;m awake at night</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.790" end="01:24:52.780" style="s2">wondering and I thank God you know like</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.739" end="01:24:55.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve I pushed myself as far as I could</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.780" end="01:24:57.110" style="s2">in this effort whatever the effort that</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.460" end="01:24:59.360" style="s2">I&#39;m considering happens to be I pushed</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.110" end="01:25:02.330" style="s2">myself I don&#39;t have a weight on my</p>

<p begin="01:25:02.330" end="01:25:06.230" style="s2">I failed to accomplish some I mean I do</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.190" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">often have those sorts of weights I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.230" end="01:25:09.500" style="s2">talking about the rare times when I</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:10.520" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.500" end="01:25:13.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like well there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.520" end="01:25:15.020" style="s2">that that&#39;s where there&#39;s some atonement</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.070" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">and some peace as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.020" end="01:25:20.960" style="s2">where that contending and that wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:23.660" style="s2">has been successful and I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.960" end="01:25:25.820" style="s2">insofar as you&#39;re deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.660" end="01:25:29.630" style="s2">that like completely involved in that</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.820" end="01:25:32.630" style="s2">thoroughly involved in that then you</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.630" end="01:25:36.140" style="s2">have the right to say that you believe</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.630" end="01:25:39.490" style="s2">in God and since I&#39;m not like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.140" end="01:25:41.630" style="s2">a hundred percent of the time or even</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.490" end="01:25:44.060" style="s2">approximating the percent of the time</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.630" end="01:25:46.310" style="s2">that I would like to be like that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.060" end="01:25:49.160" style="s2">know despite my best efforts then when</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.310" end="01:25:52.280" style="s2">people ask me I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.160" end="01:25:55.010" style="s2">something virtuous like I&#39;m a believer</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.280" end="01:25:57.410" style="s2">because there&#39;s plenty wrong with me</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.010" end="01:26:03.160" style="s2">that needs to be fixed before I would</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.410" end="01:26:13.860" style="s2">dare utter words like that thank you</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.160" end="01:26:17.440" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.860" end="01:26:31.600" style="s2">well so that&#39;s better answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.440" end="01:26:33.670" style="s2">question so thank you very much for for</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.600" end="01:26:38.590" style="s2">walking through that with me let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.670" end="01:26:41.290" style="s2">now you have all not all many of you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.590" end="01:26:44.140" style="s2">have asked some questions tonight using</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.290" end="01:26:47.080" style="s2">this nifty little device called slide Oh</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.140" end="01:26:50.080" style="s2">which I really like and so now what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.080" end="01:26:52.210" style="s2">going to do is spend 20 minutes or so</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.080" end="01:26:54.550" style="s2">looking through the questions that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.210" end="01:26:58.570" style="s2">asked and seeing if I have anything that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.550" end="01:27:01.870" style="s2">isn&#39;t completely incomprehensible and</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.570" end="01:27:04.570" style="s2">embarrassing to say about them so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.870" end="01:27:06.850" style="s2">try that hmm</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.570" end="01:27:12.790" style="s2">well this is a strange one I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.850" end="01:27:15.900" style="s2">about you people from Sydney so uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.790" end="01:27:15.900" style="s2">from Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.100" end="01:27:25.940" style="s2">which strikes me as somewhat unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.980" end="01:27:30.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s got a hundred and sixty-four up</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.940" end="01:27:37.340" style="s2">votes so which is quite a few up votes</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.940" end="01:27:40.040" style="s2">it hurt when you destroyed me on ABC now</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.340" end="01:27:43.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s referring to last</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.040" end="01:27:45.350" style="s2">night or so many months ago but I have</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.460" end="01:27:46.100" style="s2">enrolled in university to get my facts</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.350" end="01:27:54.890" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.100" end="01:27:57.650" style="s2">yeah well that probably won&#39;t work thank</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.890" end="01:28:00.550" style="s2">you for enlightening my soul the burns</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.650" end="01:28:00.550" style="s2">are still healing</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.260" end="01:28:08.930" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s it&#39;s not exactly a</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.760" end="01:28:11.239" style="s2">question it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s four sentences</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.930" end="01:28:13.760" style="s2">that are quite the strange combination</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.239" end="01:28:16.150" style="s2">that I would say something about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.760" end="01:28:20.570" style="s2">burns are still healing you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.150" end="01:28:23.780" style="s2">Nietzsche said that you could tell much</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.570" end="01:28:27.500" style="s2">about a man&#39;s character by how much</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.780" end="01:28:30.220" style="s2">truth he could tolerate which is very</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.500" end="01:28:33.050" style="s2">interesting you know there&#39;s not an idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.220" end="01:28:35.450" style="s2">in in in the in the great western</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.050" end="01:28:38.540" style="s2">tradition that the truth is the way and</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.450" end="01:28:40.160" style="s2">the path of life and and that no one</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.540" end="01:28:43.580" style="s2">comes to the Father except through the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.160" end="01:28:45.290" style="s2">truth and and I believe that to be the</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.580" end="01:28:48.440" style="s2">case because I don&#39;t think that you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.290" end="01:28:51.080" style="s2">manifest who you are without the truth</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.440" end="01:28:53.750" style="s2">and so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.080" end="01:28:57.140" style="s2">and metaphorically truth that the the</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.750" end="01:29:00.590" style="s2">pathway to who you could be if you were</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.140" end="01:29:04.250" style="s2">completely who you were is through the</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.590" end="01:29:06.380" style="s2">truth and I would say and so the truth</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.250" end="01:29:08.780" style="s2">does set you free but the problem is is</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.380" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">that it destroys everything that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.780" end="01:29:15.460" style="s2">worthy in you as it sets you free and</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:19.580" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a process of burning and</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.460" end="01:29:22.340" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s painful because you</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.580" end="01:29:23.960" style="s2">cling to what you shouldn&#39;t be partly</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.340" end="01:29:27.170" style="s2">out of pride and partly out of ignorance</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.960" end="01:29:29.450" style="s2">and partly out of laziness and and and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.170" end="01:29:31.070" style="s2">so then you encounter something true and</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.450" end="01:29:34.040" style="s2">you all know this you all know this</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.070" end="01:29:35.570" style="s2">well because when was the last time that</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.040" end="01:29:40.280" style="s2">you learned something important that</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.570" end="01:29:41.929" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a blow of some sort you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.280" end="01:29:44.570" style="s2">often you look back at your life and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.929" end="01:29:45.949" style="s2">think oh god I really learned something</p>

<p begin="01:29:45.949" end="01:29:49.280" style="s2">but it really changed my life I mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.510" end="01:29:50.929" style="s2">sometimes it can really destroy you you</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.280" end="01:29:53.210" style="s2">know an encounter with the truth and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.929" end="01:29:55.040" style="s2">never really recover but now and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.210" end="01:29:58.070" style="s2">something comes along and straightens</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.040" end="01:30:00.770" style="s2">you out and a lot of you has to go a law</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.070" end="01:30:03.440" style="s2">to you has to burn away you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.770" end="01:30:04.940" style="s2">and I suppose in some sense the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.440" end="01:30:09.440" style="s2">that everything about you that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.940" end="01:30:14.840" style="s2">worthy is to be put into the flames and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.440" end="01:30:17.239" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s another reason to be not</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.840" end="01:30:21.260" style="s2">so casual about claiming what you</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.239" end="01:30:26.989" style="s2">believe because it isn&#39;t something that</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.260" end="01:30:29.810" style="s2">you undertake with oh do caution you</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.989" end="01:30:33.699" style="s2">know I learned when I was kid about 25</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.810" end="01:30:36.710" style="s2">or so little older than a kid that</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.699" end="01:30:40.340" style="s2">almost everything that I said was one</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.710" end="01:30:44.210" style="s2">form of lie or another and I wasn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.340" end="01:30:46.190" style="s2">worse I would say that the people that I</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.210" end="01:30:49.579" style="s2">was associating with or any better and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.190" end="01:30:52.460" style="s2">and the lies were manifold you know they</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.579" end="01:30:54.710" style="s2">were attempts to win arguments for the</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.460" end="01:30:59.360" style="s2">sake of winning the argument that might</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.710" end="01:31:01.540" style="s2">be one attempts to indicate my</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.360" end="01:31:04.699" style="s2">intellectual prowess when there were</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.540" end="01:31:07.429" style="s2">competitions of that sort maybe just the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.699" end="01:31:10.659" style="s2">the sheer pleasure of engaging in an</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.429" end="01:31:13.340" style="s2">intact intellectual argument and winning</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.659" end="01:31:16.360" style="s2">my inability to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.340" end="01:31:19.130" style="s2">ideas that I had read and and</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.360" end="01:31:22.040" style="s2">incorporated because I had read but had</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.130" end="01:31:25.520" style="s2">realized that I hadn&#39;t yet earned the</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.040" end="01:31:27.440" style="s2">right to use all of that and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.520" end="01:31:28.880" style="s2">had this experience that lasted a long</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.440" end="01:31:31.730" style="s2">time while I would say it&#39;s really never</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.880" end="01:31:34.900" style="s2">gone away that and I think this was the</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.730" end="01:31:37.280" style="s2">awakening of my conscience essentially</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.900" end="01:31:39.679" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t realize that this until</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.280" end="01:31:43.639" style="s2">much later when I was reading Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.679" end="01:31:44.559" style="s2">apology this this voice for lack of a</p>

<p begin="01:31:44.559" end="01:31:51.800" style="s2">made itself manifest inside me and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.849" end="01:31:54.019" style="s2">said every time I said something that</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.800" end="01:31:57.590" style="s2">wasn&#39;t true and that&#39;s usually what it</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.019" end="01:32:00.439" style="s2">said that&#39;s not true you don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.590" end="01:32:02.149" style="s2">that or there was a sensation that was</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.439" end="01:32:04.219" style="s2">associated with it I don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.149" end="01:32:06.439" style="s2">that uncommon you know I asked my</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.219" end="01:32:10.280" style="s2">psychology classes for many years in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.439" end="01:32:12.289" style="s2">row if they hadn&#39;t experienced this</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.280" end="01:32:15.019" style="s2">experience that they had a voice in</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.289" end="01:32:20.059" style="s2">their head let&#39;s say it&#39;s a metaphor or</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.019" end="01:32:22.309" style="s2">a feeling that communicated to them when</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.059" end="01:32:27.139" style="s2">they were about to do something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.309" end="01:32:28.789" style="s2">and it was universally the case that</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.139" end="01:32:30.439" style="s2">people agreed with one of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.789" end="01:32:32.209" style="s2">statements or another and the other</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.439" end="01:32:34.249" style="s2">thing I would ask is well do you always</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.209" end="01:32:36.739" style="s2">listen to it and of course the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.249" end="01:32:38.840" style="s2">that was definitely no but that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.739" end="01:32:41.570" style="s2">very interesting you know that you can</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.840" end="01:32:43.639" style="s2">have this faculty this conscience this</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.570" end="01:32:45.949" style="s2">seems to to me to be very tightly</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.639" end="01:32:48.139" style="s2">associated with the idea of free will is</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.949" end="01:32:49.039" style="s2">that you can have this internal voice</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.139" end="01:32:51.679" style="s2">this Damon</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.039" end="01:32:54.769" style="s2">the root word for democracy oh yes I</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.679" end="01:32:56.899" style="s2">didn&#39;t finish that story so the yes well</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.769" end="01:32:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s important well so Socrates Damon</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.899" end="01:33:02.510" style="s2">told him it was his moral guide and</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.679" end="01:33:06.829" style="s2">democracy appears to be predicated on</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.510" end="01:33:10.629" style="s2">the idea that the polity will function</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.829" end="01:33:13.789" style="s2">if people attend to their consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.629" end="01:33:16.489" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the that&#39;s the overlap</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.789" end="01:33:18.199" style="s2">of those conceptualizations and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.489" end="01:33:21.919" style="s2">that that&#39;s it well first of all I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.199" end="01:33:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the case you know and it makes a</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.919" end="01:33:25.309" style="s2">certain amount of logical sense I mean</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.360" end="01:33:27.739" style="s2">if we assume that the political state is</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.309" end="01:33:30.649" style="s2">something like the emergent consequence</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.739" end="01:33:33.079" style="s2">of the decisions of all its citizens we</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.649" end="01:33:36.789" style="s2">would assume that the wiser the</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.079" end="01:33:41.090" style="s2">decisions of the citizens the more</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.789" end="01:33:42.530" style="s2">upright and functional the state I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.090" end="01:33:44.599" style="s2">see how it could be any other way</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.530" end="01:33:46.219" style="s2">and perhaps those who are the most</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.599" end="01:33:49.249" style="s2">upright who listen to their</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.219" end="01:33:52.609" style="s2">consciousness consciences more carefully</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.249" end="01:33:56.349" style="s2">even play a disproportionately powerful</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.609" end="01:34:03.050" style="s2">role it&#39;s certainly possible so</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.349" end="01:34:07.159" style="s2">anyways back to truth well you know I</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.050" end="01:34:09.949" style="s2">learned that so much of what I was doing</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.159" end="01:34:11.840" style="s2">was false and I think I learned this CIA</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.949" end="01:34:15.610" style="s2">there was a reason that this came to me</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.840" end="01:34:19.699" style="s2">so clearly I was trying to understand</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.610" end="01:34:21.739" style="s2">why people did terrible things and I was</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.699" end="01:34:25.130" style="s2">really concentrating on the terrible</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.739" end="01:34:29.059" style="s2">terrible things that people do and I was</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.130" end="01:34:31.369" style="s2">interested in Auschwitz for example and</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.059" end="01:34:34.880" style="s2">Nora now known as a political phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.369" end="01:34:37.579" style="s2">but as a as a psychological phenomena I</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.880" end="01:34:40.250" style="s2">was curious about how you could be a</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.579" end="01:34:42.020" style="s2">nosh wits guard and I wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.250" end="01:34:44.869" style="s2">curious about how you could be one</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.020" end="01:34:47.420" style="s2">because well you could be whatnot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.869" end="01:34:49.730" style="s2">course I was more curious about how I</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.420" end="01:34:53.619" style="s2">could be one being such a good person as</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.730" end="01:34:57.980" style="s2">I thought I was and but I also knew that</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.619" end="01:34:59.960" style="s2">people many people did many terrible</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.980" end="01:35:02.510" style="s2">things during the 20th century and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.960" end="01:35:04.849" style="s2">idea that I was somehow better than them</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.510" end="01:35:06.320" style="s2">or that I should assume a priori that I</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.849" end="01:35:08.599" style="s2">was better than them and that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.320" end="01:35:10.730" style="s2">have made the same choices or worse had</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.599" end="01:35:13.429" style="s2">I been in the same situation was a very</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.730" end="01:35:14.750" style="s2">very very dangerous supposition and in</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.429" end="01:35:17.270" style="s2">fact a sufficiently dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.750" end="01:35:19.730" style="s2">supposition to bring about the very</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.270" end="01:35:23.270" style="s2">danger that I assumed was worth avoiding</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.730" end="01:35:25.969" style="s2">I had this idea you know that what had</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.270" end="01:35:28.579" style="s2">happened especially in Nazi Germany but</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.969" end="01:35:32.300" style="s2">also in in the Soviet Union shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.579" end="01:35:34.070" style="s2">happen again that what we needed to do</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.300" end="01:35:36.079" style="s2">because of what happened in the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.070" end="01:35:39.230" style="s2">century especially because we also</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.079" end="01:35:41.329" style="s2">managed to create hydrogen bombs that it</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.230" end="01:35:43.309" style="s2">was in that and that we had become so</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.329" end="01:35:45.260" style="s2">technologically powerful that it would</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.309" end="01:35:47.449" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t time for that anymore that</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.260" end="01:35:49.849" style="s2">time for that was over and that we</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.449" end="01:35:53.449" style="s2">really needed to understand why it</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.849" end="01:35:55.940" style="s2">happened and that perhaps we could go</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.449" end="01:35:57.739" style="s2">deep enough in that understanding which</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.940" end="01:36:01.670" style="s2">is I think what happens when you go deep</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.739" end="01:36:04.250" style="s2">and understanding so that you could stop</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.670" end="01:36:07.130" style="s2">it because if you if you understand the</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.250" end="01:36:09.159" style="s2">problem maybe you can solve it you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.130" end="01:36:12.190" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.159" end="01:36:15.790" style="s2">at least in part I came to believe that</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.190" end="01:36:18.159" style="s2">the problem was as Solzhenitsyn said</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.790" end="01:36:20.679" style="s2">that the problem is is that the line</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.159" end="01:36:23.320" style="s2">between good and evil runs down every</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.679" end="01:36:24.940" style="s2">human heart and I&#39;d was reading young at</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.320" end="01:36:27.250" style="s2">the same time you know and he believed</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.940" end="01:36:29.010" style="s2">that the human soul was a tree whose</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.250" end="01:36:31.449" style="s2">roots grew all the way to hell and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.010" end="01:36:33.610" style="s2">believed also that in the full</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.449" end="01:36:36.520" style="s2">investigation of the shadow which was</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.610" end="01:36:38.889" style="s2">the dark side of the human psyche was</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.520" end="01:36:41.199" style="s2">that it was bottomless essentially that</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.889" end="01:36:45.449" style="s2">that that it was like an experience of</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.199" end="01:36:50.620" style="s2">Hell and that also struck me as true and</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.449" end="01:36:52.690" style="s2">that the way to stop those sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.620" end="01:36:54.880" style="s2">things from happening was to stop</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.690" end="01:36:59.199" style="s2">yourself from being the sort of person</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.880" end="01:37:00.760" style="s2">who would do it who would even start to</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.199" end="01:37:02.739" style="s2">do it because the other thing you learn</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.760" end="01:37:04.780" style="s2">when you learn about atrocities of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.739" end="01:37:07.030" style="s2">sort you could read ordinary men by the</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.780" end="01:37:08.710" style="s2">way which is an unbelievably great study</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.030" end="01:37:12.070" style="s2">of exactly this sort of phenomena it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.710" end="01:37:13.900" style="s2">on my book list on my website it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.070" end="01:37:17.230" style="s2">a group of German policemen who were</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.900" end="01:37:19.090" style="s2">turned into brutal murderers over a</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.230" end="01:37:21.130" style="s2">period of months when they went behind</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.090" end="01:37:22.510" style="s2">when they went into Poland after the</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.130" end="01:37:24.489" style="s2">Germans had marched - and they were just</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.510" end="01:37:26.320" style="s2">ordinary middle-class men and they</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.489" end="01:37:28.150" style="s2">weren&#39;t forced into this by their</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.320" end="01:37:29.440" style="s2">leadership by the way either which was</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.150" end="01:37:33.790" style="s2">one of the things that makes the book so</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.440" end="01:37:36.699" style="s2">interesting so for me it was a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.790" end="01:37:38.710" style="s2">understanding that if we want this sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.699" end="01:37:40.510" style="s2">of thing to not happen anymore then we</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.710" end="01:37:41.889" style="s2">have to start to become the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.510" end="01:37:43.780" style="s2">people who wouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.889" end="01:37:45.460" style="s2">which seems rather self-evident all</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.780" end="01:37:47.889" style="s2">things considered unless you know you</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.460" end="01:37:50.320" style="s2">believe that were the pawns of social</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.889" end="01:37:52.989" style="s2">forces for example like the Marxists do</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.320" end="01:37:55.900" style="s2">and I don&#39;t believe that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.989" end="01:37:58.060" style="s2">also the creator of social forces and</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.900" end="01:38:01.090" style="s2">we&#39;re also capable of standing up to</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.060" end="01:38:03.070" style="s2">social forces because I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.090" end="01:38:05.440" style="s2">individual is more powerful than the</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.070" end="01:38:08.550" style="s2">social force all things considered</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.440" end="01:38:12.429" style="s2">interestingly enough that the way to</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.550" end="01:38:15.429" style="s2">stop such things - from happening the</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.429" end="01:38:21.150" style="s2">way to remember properly is to</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.429" end="01:38:24.690" style="s2">understand that that you could do it</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.150" end="01:38:27.100" style="s2">that you could do those terrible things</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.690" end="01:38:31.780" style="s2">because the people who did them were</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.100" end="01:38:36.520" style="s2">like you and that the way out of that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.780" end="01:38:40.449" style="s2">to stop being like that and the way you</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.520" end="01:38:44.710" style="s2">stop being like that is well at least in</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.449" end="01:38:50.170" style="s2">part by stop by ceasing to tell yourself</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.710" end="01:38:53.020" style="s2">lies that you don&#39;t believe in and that</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.170" end="01:38:54.130" style="s2">you know you shouldn&#39;t act out and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.020" end="01:38:56.310" style="s2">know and that&#39;s made a huge difference</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.130" end="01:39:00.040" style="s2">in my life for better for worse I mean</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.310" end="01:39:05.070" style="s2">it was very uncanny experience I would</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.040" end="01:39:13.570" style="s2">say because it&#39;s very discombobulating</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.070" end="01:39:16.090" style="s2">to experience yourself as fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.570" end="01:39:20.230" style="s2">enough so that much of what you do and</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.090" end="01:39:24.940" style="s2">say is actually false it&#39;s a lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.230" end="01:39:30.280" style="s2">to clean that up a lot but the</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.940" end="01:39:34.949" style="s2">consequences are in principle worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.280" end="01:39:37.060" style="s2">and so that was part of what</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.949" end="01:39:39.010" style="s2">understanding that was part of what</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.060" end="01:39:41.260" style="s2">drove me towards clinical psychology</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.010" end="01:39:43.210" style="s2">saying away from political science and</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.260" end="01:39:45.699" style="s2">law and from politics in general because</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.210" end="01:39:50.080" style="s2">I started to believe that and I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.699" end="01:39:51.699" style="s2">this is the great Western idea which</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.080" end="01:39:55.150" style="s2">people were quite irritated about by the</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.699" end="01:39:57.040" style="s2">way on Q&amp;A last night as well that the</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.150" end="01:40:00.250" style="s2">proper route forward for the redemption</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.040" end="01:40:03.190" style="s2">of the individual and for mankind as a</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.250" end="01:40:05.650" style="s2">whole is as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.190" end="01:40:07.690" style="s2">redemption of each individual and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.650" end="01:40:10.949" style="s2">truly believe that and I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.690" end="01:40:13.840" style="s2">that occurs as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.949" end="01:40:16.090" style="s2">adherence to the truth and courage in</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.840" end="01:40:17.739" style="s2">the face of being that&#39;s rule one right</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.090" end="01:40:20.800" style="s2">to stand up straight with your shoulders</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.739" end="01:40:23.860" style="s2">back is to take on the onslaught and to</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.800" end="01:40:27.070" style="s2">enter the contentious ring and to do</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.860" end="01:40:29.949" style="s2">your to do and to do more than your best</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.070" end="01:40:31.719" style="s2">because your best isn&#39;t enough because</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.949" end="01:40:34.269" style="s2">your best isn&#39;t as good as you could be</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.719" end="01:40:36.460" style="s2">you have to push yourself past that</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.269" end="01:40:39.999" style="s2">and and that&#39;s as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.460" end="01:40:41.800" style="s2">where you find what you need in life you</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.999" end="01:40:44.619" style="s2">find the meaning that sustains you in</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.800" end="01:40:47.559" style="s2">life and you find the patterns of action</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.619" end="01:40:49.690" style="s2">that redeem the world both at the same</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.559" end="01:40:53.829" style="s2">time I mean life is a very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.690" end="01:40:56.590" style="s2">business you know it&#39;s it&#39;s fatal and</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.829" end="01:41:00.099" style="s2">it&#39;s full of suffering and it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.590" end="01:41:01.749" style="s2">full of betrayal and malevolence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.099" end="01:41:06.789" style="s2">nothing about it that&#39;s trivial</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.749" end="01:41:10.539" style="s2">it&#39;s all profound and in order to find</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.789" end="01:41:12.730" style="s2">your way through all of that that that</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.539" end="01:41:17.739" style="s2">capacity for hellish experience let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.730" end="01:41:20.079" style="s2">say you need to develop a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.739" end="01:41:23.800" style="s2">with something that&#39;s profound</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.079" end="01:41:26.139" style="s2">and you can you have that capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.800" end="01:41:28.389" style="s2">what could be more profound than the</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.139" end="01:41:30.730" style="s2">truth and what would you rather have on</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.389" end="01:41:32.530" style="s2">your side and you might say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.730" end="01:41:33.909" style="s2">obvious and of course everyone should do</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.530" end="01:41:37.480" style="s2">that and then you need to know why you</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.909" end="01:41:40.780" style="s2">don&#39;t and the answer is well it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.480" end="01:41:43.659" style="s2">encapsulated in this first amusing</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.780" end="01:41:47.110" style="s2">question you don&#39;t thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.659" end="01:41:51.130" style="s2">enlightening my soul the burns are still</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.110" end="01:41:54.360" style="s2">healing it&#39;s like well you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.130" end="01:41:58.659" style="s2">no shortage of Deadwood to burn off and</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.360" end="01:42:01.030" style="s2">and there&#39;s no shortage of pain when the</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.659" end="01:42:03.249" style="s2">deadwood burns off and that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.030" end="01:42:05.349" style="s2">people afraid of the truth you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.249" end="01:42:08.489" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s why Moses encountered God</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.349" end="01:42:11.679" style="s2">in the burning bush who the hell knows</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.489" end="01:42:16.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about that idea</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.679" end="01:42:18.969" style="s2">that seems to me to be the case and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.230" end="01:42:21.519" style="s2">what&#39;s the decision that you make you</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.969" end="01:42:24.309" style="s2">know you decide to believe you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.519" end="01:42:27.280" style="s2">a risk an existential risk it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.309" end="01:42:29.860" style="s2">active faith you believe that the truth</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.280" end="01:42:33.429" style="s2">can set you free you believe that people</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.860" end="01:42:35.769" style="s2">have an intrinsic divinity about their</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.429" end="01:42:37.030" style="s2">soul you decide that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.769" end="01:42:38.769" style="s2">live in that manner and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.030" end="01:42:44.619" style="s2">going to let everything about yourself</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.769" end="01:42:48.159" style="s2">that isn&#39;t worthy of that goal die and</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.619" end="01:42:51.310" style="s2">that might be almost every</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.159" end="01:42:54.460" style="s2">that you are and that&#39;s a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.310" end="01:42:58.300" style="s2">to contemplate the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.460" end="01:43:02.590" style="s2">worse I would say is the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.300" end="01:43:04.510" style="s2">because the alternative is the sorts of</p>

<p begin="01:43:10.600" end="01:43:15.489" style="s2">regimes of the 20th century and it would</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.810" end="01:43:19.030" style="s2">be a good thing if we decided</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.489" end="01:43:25.409" style="s2">collectively and individually not to go</p>
