<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">i&#39;d like to do today is talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve been using dialogue in classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">and specifically using dialogue in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">classrooms to encourage engagement</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">belonging</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">and then some ethical reasoning with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">um i have an exercise i&#39;ll have you try</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">so to get you sort of oriented to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">um and get so you can have a feel for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">how this might work</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">um so it&#39;ll be sort of a down and dirty</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">crash course</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">in what all of this is um i think it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">take about 25 minutes to sort of get</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">through the crash course</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">and then i&#39;d love to open this up for</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">some conversation about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">so please though at any time um if</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">something is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">unclear or especially if you can&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">me or</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">you just think i&#39;m going too fast stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">ask a question because i get really</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">excited about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">and i can start talking really really</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s especially hard over zoom so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">with that i&#39;m going to do that thing we</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">and share a screen</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">give me one second to get this where it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">will go</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">there we go so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">constructive listening uh dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">classrooms for engagement belonging and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">ethical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">um this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">quite a bit of work that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">happening over several years and so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">i&#39;d like to do is start with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">background of this work</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">and talk about the basis of it which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">reflective structured dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">so what this is um it&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">form of dialogic practice developed in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">the late 1980s in boston</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">um and it was developed amongst</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">practitioners in family therapy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">intervene in really bad family dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">but it came into the public sphere right</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">so out of the office so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">in response to a series of abortion</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">clinic shootings that happened in 1989</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">uh roughly what happens as the nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">that owns this they are called essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">partners</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">their practitioners were watching some</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">truly bad discourse</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">around those shootings on both sides the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">pro-life side and the pro-choice side</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">and they were starting to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">that the dynamics they were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">looked like those bad family dynamics in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">which they were commonly intervening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">their practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">and so they invited um pro-choice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">pro-life folks to a series of actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">secret conversations these happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">in a manner so that nobody was risking</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">their kind of professional</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">reputations on them with an idea not</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">that they would ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">agree about abortion but they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">learn how to re-humanize each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">have a conversation again</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">even around those really contentious</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">issues and long story short is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">actually went really well</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">um again nobody agreed at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">that abortion was either something we</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">should or shouldn&#39;t have in the united</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">but they came away from those</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">talking about their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">rehumanize that other side a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">people became friends after those</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">and so that initial group of therapists</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">decided to found a non-profit at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">time called the public conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">to take this method out onto the streets</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">and here&#39;s what the method is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">called reflective structure dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">and it does indeed privilege reflection</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">as a practice right this is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:40.639" style="s2">that makes a little bit different than</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">some other forms of dialogue that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.639" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">out there you may have run into</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">um it gives people time to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">asking them to answer a question or</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">offer some new idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">or revelation um so one thing i have</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">learned to do in classrooms for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">is just ask people to take a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">before i then go back to my students and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">ask them to answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like this pedagogical deep breath</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ve engaged reflection um before</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">we have people speaking before we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">them listening</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:18.840" style="s2">um i now engage it just to start a class</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">and kind of make it a ritual in the work</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a really important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">um one thing i actually want to back up</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">and realize i didn&#39;t say is i</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">got hooked up with these good folks um</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">at essential partners</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">through their current co-executive</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">director john ceruth</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">who was a college friend of mine we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">known each other for a really long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">he came into dallas um in 2014 and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">hadn&#39;t seen each other in forever</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">and just went out to have a drink and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">the more he was talking about using</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">these methods it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">give you this overview of here in just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">minute the more i</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">understood that would be really useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">especially for my graduate students i</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">teach</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">folks to go out and teach religion in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">public universities</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">and in private universities and in other</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">what i hadn&#39;t been teaching students was</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">how to have the difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">around religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">that invariably come up in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">i am not so sure i don&#39;t know where all</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">of you are coming from but at least in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">the united states and especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">southern united states</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">we have students who were actually told</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">never to speak about religion or</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">politics because it would be impolite</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">and so when we bring them into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">religious studies classroom for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">first time</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">they really don&#39;t know how to have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">intellectual conversation about what</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">they have no notion about where to start</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">and we weren&#39;t doing ourselves a favor</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">by not</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">training our phd students into that sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">of discourse about how to have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">so i got really interested in what he</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">was saying and he got really interested</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">in what i was saying about teaching on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">university campus</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">because he was getting called more and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">more often into</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">a sort of bias incident problems and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">public conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">does our essential partners now does a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">conflict mediation work a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">conflict transformation work</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been increasingly called</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">onto college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">and so he wanted to know more about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">culture of those campuses</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">and the more we started talking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">continuing to talk about things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">free speech issues the more we realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:25.840" style="s2">we really wanted to develop something</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">and also john was in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">other folks on other campuses so he</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">brought us all together</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">and what you&#39;ll hear when i get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">dialogic classrooms as a result of all</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">of those conversations and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">research that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">but back to reflective structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">dialogue um again really privileges</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">taking that breath</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">for reflection then we use structure to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">hold the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">most rooms you&#39;re in after you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">there about five minutes you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">know who&#39;s going to talk and who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">going to talk it&#39;s certainly true in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">we even know where those people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">going to sit in the room they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">probably our first row off to my left</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s those five people uh even if i</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">have a class of 35 or 40.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">and that holds up certain structures but</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t allow our quieter people or</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">the people who may</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">need a little more time to process a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">of room to speak or contribute in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">and so when we do a full-on reflective</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">structure dialogue not only do we give</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">that time for reflection</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">we put a timer on people i will give you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say 90 seconds to think and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">everyone will have 90 seconds to speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">before the days of covid we would pass</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">the timer around a circle</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">um now we create that circle on zoom and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">the facilitator holds the timer</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">just using your phone and that structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">we ask a specific question to which</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">people are to respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">that structure allows people to first of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">speak to what&#39;s true to them they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">time to reflect on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">it also allows them to really listen to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">when you&#39;ve had that time to think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re gonna say and when you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">that you will have your 90 seconds or</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">you can just sort of stop worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">your own performance</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">put that aside for a minute and actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">really engage and listen to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">somebody else has to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">a lot of my students that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">revolutionary part of this they realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">they&#39;re really listening in a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">for the first time ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re more nervous about</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">for my students who speak a lot it may</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">be the first time that they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">literally ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">turned around in the classroom and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.360" style="s2">listened to their classmates</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">i have one particularly gifted student</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">who just graduated</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">who talks about that first time he</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">turned around</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">to listen to everybody else in the room</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">and how powerful that was for him</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">because he realized he hadn&#39;t been doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">he was one of those guys in the front</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">row always talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">then finally we spend a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">dialogic classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">emphasizing listening to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">speaking to be understood</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">so this is not the usual academic mode</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">of persuasion</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">when i want students to write a paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">for me with a thesis and use evidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a persuasive piece of writing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">i still want them to do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">but in the classroom especially if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">are just beginning to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">territory that may be</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">divisive i don&#39;t want you to persuade</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">i want you to speak in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">other people could understand where</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">usually based on a personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">or deeply held belief or value</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">and then i want you to listen not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">hear the holes in somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">but to really understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to say to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">so we practice this in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">so that people are set up to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">understand and then speak to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">right because again this is not our</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">current public discourse it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">um and we need to actually give people</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">work at doing all of this the listening</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">one thing we&#39;ve come to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">that most of our academic curriculum we</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">give students real credit for speaking</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">and for writing</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">both of those things are literally</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">tagged for instance in my curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">here at southern methodist university</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">we never teach them how to listen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">not the sort of trophy you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">in your curriculum or you probably never</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">got a listening award</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">i&#39;m in high school where you as you may</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">have gotten a writing or speaking award</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">and so we&#39;re learning we really have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">emphasize the listening part</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to move people into this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">space that we&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">so the result of that my meeting up with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">this friend and us doing some research</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">and talking a lot with a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">really talented people</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">is indeed something we&#39;ve come to call</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">dialogic classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do in those</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">classrooms is inculcate a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">to use those skills i was just talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">so that students will turn to other</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">students and say so what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">about that i knew this was really</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:59.839" style="s2">when indeed i realized i had a class a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">few years ago on social science</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.839" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">where students started speaking in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">sort of 90-second snippet they started</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">doing it very naturally</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">and then they would just turn around to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">their classmates and say so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">i got to pull back they were genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">curious and they were having amazing</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">and intellectual conversations that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">at a completely different level than</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">anything i&#39;d had before</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">so this is something we&#39;ve learned we</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">really want to emphasize and we talk a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">lot about</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">why curiosity is good for you why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">going to make you a better student</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">why it can help you even outside of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">school one thing we&#39;ve noticed when we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">use dialogue in classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">um so we do full on reflective</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">structured dialogue and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">things we call dialogic moments</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">and those may be where we just ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">people to reflect on something</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">is that students told us in follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">surveys they had a much</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">greater sense of belonging in those</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">they didn&#39;t feel alienated they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">to come they felt like they had friends</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">um and perhaps the thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">struck us was they felt like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">they had to say would be listened to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">and they were linking that directly to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">the sense that this is a place where</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">they could be themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">um i had another place that brought me</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">to thinking this was a really great idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">is when i had a student reflect</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">in a piece of writing that she had never</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">told anyone before on campus what</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">religion she was</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">because she felt like it would not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">okay that something about this class</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">let her share that in a way that she</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">felt like she would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">supported in some way it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">everybody else is going to convert to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">her religion but it was that she could</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">say what was true for her and nobody was</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">just going to shoot her down</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">based on some stereotype they had about</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">instead they were going to ask her more</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">about why she was or where she&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">from or what her family was like</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">um the other thing and this is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">happy thing for us</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">and students we&#39;re reporting very high</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">levels of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">in classes where we&#39;re using dialogue a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">lot um both with other</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">people in the class with students but</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">also with course content</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">and i think the day i may have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">fully converted to doing this really</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">intentionally all the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">from being sort of casual about it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">when a group of sorority women walked</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">into my class</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">in april talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">chapter dinner they just had these sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">of meetings they have on mondays</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">where they were talking about analytic</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">philosophy with their sorority sisters</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">you just read some alvin plantinga and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many of you do analytic</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">philosophy but he&#39;s a hardcore analytic</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">philosopher it&#39;s a lot like reading math</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">and they had brought it to their</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">sorority sisters and were very excited</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">about this thing and wanted to share it</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">prior to that moment i was pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">that most of my students in late april</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">weren&#39;t reading anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">much less making their way through a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">pretty difficult analytic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">so that level of engagement is part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">the piece of the magic</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">of this for me um as an instructor and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">then they were also coming back to share</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">it and tell me it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">happened they were downright excited</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">that they&#39;d gotten their sorority</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">sisters</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">into a down and dirty conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">i think it was the problem with evil or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">with alvin plantinga story so it just</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">gets students really involved and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.199" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">excited</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s native to them and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">means they&#39;re going to learn stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">it also means they just keep coming to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">uh the other thing that dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">classrooms do</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">is give students a sense of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">students report</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">that they feel like they can listen to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">something with which they deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">um and actually listen all the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">through and not just tune it out or shut</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">so there is that connection that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">when you feel like you don&#39;t have to run</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">away from something that&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">we have a lot of student writing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">that feeling when they realized that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">were brave enough and the space was</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">brave enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">that they could hear something that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">really hard because it went up against</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">a deeply behind deeply held believer</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">world view</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">which is really the root of this work</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">was getting people to that space</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">and the fact that it gets replicated in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">classrooms is fantastic for us</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">because again it leads to that increased</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">sense of belonging that culture of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">curiosity and that engagement</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">this is also though what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">important about this it&#39;s this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">just for contentious issues</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">i will use dialogue now to teach about</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">the idea of design um when i teach</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">philosophy of religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">we read the analogical teleological</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">argument for the existence of god which</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">is a fancy way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">you can infer god&#39;s existence because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">things like eyes</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s something in the design of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">those that should lead one to and for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">creator</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">i was having a heck of a time in</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">previous iterations of that course</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">getting students to really dig into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">question of design and purpose do we</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">really know what the purpose is for</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">and so a couple of years ago i just</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">started with this moment and i asked you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">know can you think of a time</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">when you didn&#39;t know what something was</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">for and then you re then you had this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">aha moment and you understood it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">and one student talked about a cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">lighter in a car</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">he had this moment where he realized</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">that one could actually light a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">cigarette with it and it wasn&#39;t just for</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">plugging in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">electronics and he felt sort of silly</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">that he&#39;d never understood it but he</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">also had this</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">he&#39;s like i went through my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">not understanding that that thing could</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">light a cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">and another student talked about she&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">bought in a keurig coffee maker</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">and it came with this little empty mesh</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">basket and the moment about five weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">after she&#39;d gotten the coffee maker</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">where she realized you could put coffee</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">in the little empty mesh thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have to go buy k-cups for they</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">what this did so everybody could sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">identify with those stories in the room</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">and then when we talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">analogy leologic argument they realized</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">because of those stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">that purpose and design are not always</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">obviously related</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">and they had a much smarter take about</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">that particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">philosophy of religion that day it</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t take me trying to walk them</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">through it step by step they could just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">make the leap and we could get much</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">deeper into it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">so i find this stuff absolute magic for</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s yes it&#39;s connecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">them yes they feel free to even offer</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">those sorts of slightly vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">stories in a room or sometimes very</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">vulnerable stories</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s just flat out really great for</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">people learning stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">so here&#39;s where i&#39;d like you to try um</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">a version of this so what i&#39;ll need is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">two volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m not sure i can&#39;t see everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">if you&#39;d like to volunteer can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">please indicate it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:01.679" style="s2">donald rush at once i mean margaret and</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">what i&#39;d like you to do andy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">person a and this is an exercise we run</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">students through to get them</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">to know the difference between asking a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">genuine question of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">and a rhetorical question which is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">so curious</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">and again it&#39;s getting them to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">understand what we mean when we say</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">speaking to be understood listening to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">understand so</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">here&#39;s how this exercise works andy</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;re going to make a statement and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">should be about something you care about</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">but not necessarily something that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">life and death so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">cat videos are the best thing on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">or maybe universal health care is an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">absolute human right</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">pick something that matters to you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">then tarray you&#39;re going to spend a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">minute and i will keep a timer on you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">responding to that question with</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">questions but they&#39;re designed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">persuade</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">andy out of his stance</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">all right so if andy says cat videos are</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">the best thing on the internet you might</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">do you believe that everyone should</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">really be educated</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">what do you mean by education or</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">educated in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">and most of our students would come away</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">wow i learned a lot more about my own</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">when you actually asked me you know what</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">and they report listening to each other</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">like uh and then open it up to some</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">um this is based on some research we got</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">a large grant to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">look at what happens when we train</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">then we surveyed their students</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">um and so when we asked um</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">them to rate so the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">dialogue in this classroom helped me</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">feel a sense of belonging in the class</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">it was so overwhelming actually we went</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">back to retool the question we thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">we&#39;d completely blown it because it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem statistically possible to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">uh but this range was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">verified each and every time we did it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">um overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">like 90 of students talked about</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">belonging in dialogic classrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">having that sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">increase because they&#39;ve been able to</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">this is the course content um question</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">and again you&#39;ll see it&#39;s really heavily</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">skewed towards people telling us</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">that not only was dialogue good for</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">their sense of belonging um</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">but they felt like they just understood</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">what was going on in the course much</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">their engagement and we need to do more</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">research to understand why this is true</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">but again if we&#39;ve got sorority women</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">at chapters and i think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">they were reading more</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">and talking about it more and just</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">feeling like it belonged to them in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">maybe normally isn&#39;t the case</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">um and here&#39;s the other thing we got</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.600" style="s2">excited about students were much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">willing to speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">in these classes uh faculty had reported</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">was much higher than usual</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">and students reported they were much</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">more willing to speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">the other thing that was really happy</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">for us is this willingness to speak did</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">correlate with their idea that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">would agree with what they had to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">there was no statistical correlation</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">so they were wanting to speak more um</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">and actually the students who</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">on this particular histogram had said</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">they wanted to speak less when we went</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">back in to fine-tune that question</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">they were speaking less because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">wanted to listen more it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">they felt like the atmosphere was</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">somehow not conducive to speaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">so just to wrap up this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">picture that some faculty drew for us</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">about the classroom from hell what they</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s got silent students in the back</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">they&#39;re distracted</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">um some constant talker in the front you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">can&#39;t move furniture</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of in that awful setup that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">we have you know the stadium seating the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">room is dark</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">um and so one question we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">dealing with and wanting to dig into</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">more is how do we create this culture of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">and then how can we move that outside of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">classrooms into civic or ethical region</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">how do we go from that awful diagram to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">something more like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">where students are fully engaged with</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.200" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">in a way that they could take you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">outside of this particular controlled</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">atmosphere of a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">um to get at that um</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">we create these conditions and one</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">reason that those classrooms work</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">is we have communication agreements that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">students themselves create</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">we ask students in this exercise we call</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">moment of descent um</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">what would it take for you to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">something different after seven people</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">have all just said the same thing or</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">supported the same view in a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">but what is true for you is not true for</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">them based on a deeply held value or</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">and this is an example of what students</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">will put up on a board and from which we</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">craft the agreements</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">what this does is allow me to enforce</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">those agreements in a class</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">right so if our agreement is to be open</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">to minority opinion</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">right or to let people develop and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">conclude comments before responding so</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">not interrupting</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">if somebody in a class interrupts i can</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">say i&#39;m going to pause you there we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">this agreement that you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">right so we&#39;ll get to you we all are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">going to have time but please</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">stop interrupting for now</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">um that is the kind of thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">hoping students will move out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to report</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">that they&#39;re moving out to the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">um one way i&#39;m having students think</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">about that bigger world is with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">how do you want to be in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">this is developed with a university</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">ethics professor steve long here at</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">southern methodist university</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">for him this is sort of the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">and i just wanted to share a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">answers that my students have given to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">when posed to them i want to be someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">who understands all sides of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">before deciding what i think and someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">who is always open to new</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">this class helped me see a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:27.040" style="s2">doing that through non-combative</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.040" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be known as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t listen to the other side of an</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">argument because this doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">anything done</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">this class taught me the value of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">listening actually listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">to try and understand where other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">are coming from</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">and then this one one of my absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">favorites um</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">i have not by any means become an eager</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">political reformist who goes out to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">peddle their beliefs on the street</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">corner</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">but this class did teach me that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">dialogue between people that don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">and it can be civil understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">productive</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">i used to joke that i was a passive</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">anarchist waiting for civilization to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">crumble under the weight of twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">all of its friends</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">however our dialogues and the outlook of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">the class gave me hope for a world where</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">i can listen and be heard by people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">don&#39;t have the exact same political</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">beliefs as me</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">after all we can&#39;t get anything done if</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not listening to each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">she then went on actually to name the us</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">congress as an example of people not</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">so that is the hope and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">basic approach to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">and i welcome your questions and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">great thank you jill um</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m i&#39;m really struck by</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">the idea that when we feel we are being</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">listened to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">we are much more careful about what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">say um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">we&#39;re much more thoughtful i should say</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">about what we put out in our speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">uh so we have a couple of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">came up</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">um andy would you like to unmute and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">start with yours</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">and then sure so at the beginning you</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">were talking about these uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">time-based um sessions where</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">one person goes then you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">around the circle and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">um then uh in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">the exercise we did it was more</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">kind of improvisational and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">you incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">um both so that both the quiet people</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">can be heard and you um</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">can&#39;t allow for follow-up questions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">um great question</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">yeah so the general structure of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">really formal dialogues i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">actually kind of got a feel for that i</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">think you were on timers</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">right even in the improvisation there</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a way that structure can</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.399" style="s2">actually support that kind of back and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.399" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">but the generals there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">structure to most of those formal</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">dialogues and the first question</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">the first go-round um asked people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">that would help us understand how they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">came to believe what they believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">about guns in american society abortion</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">whatever the thing is so everybody will</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">speak one at a time about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">and then the second question generally</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">digs a little bit deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">into what is the heart of the matter for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">you what values</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">are you drawing on as you think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">what you believe about whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">and then a third question we&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">where you feel pulled</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">in different directions right most</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">people even if they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">hard on one side of an issue do have</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">some reservations</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">right so if you&#39;re a hardcore second</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">amendment person here in the united</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">for gun ownership um you know they may</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">still feel like not everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">have a gun and they may have some</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">reservations and that allows them to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">express that complexity for them</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a fourth round where we</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">encouraged people throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">dialogue to write down their curious</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">questions for one another</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s when we give them about 20</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">minutes of back and forth of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">curious questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">right um so i did a gun dialogue um</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">in a class here in texas something i</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">never ever thought i would want to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">i went with fear and trepidation into</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">this thing um</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">and somebody in his first round was</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">talking about growing up in a very small</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">town</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">there was no movie theater and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">entertained themselves by running around</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">his backyard with rifles</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">and so a student who is not she&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">an urban setting</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">it you know this entire time she&#39;s dying</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">to ask the question she finally got to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">in that open round which is how big is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">your backyard</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t picture acreage right she</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">comes she came from urban california</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">with a pretty small you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">and they came to understood stand they</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">understood guns</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">really differently she was thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">sort of gang violence stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">which he couldn&#39;t really imagine right</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">and he was imagining shooting feral hogs</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually where you need a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">pretty big weapon here in texas</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">and they had this aha moment where</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">without those stories</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">they would have just said sort of i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">pro-second amendment i am pro-gun</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">control and they never would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">understood that they&#39;re not even really</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">talking in some ways about the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">it was just amazing to sort of watch</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">unfold and have these moments like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s where that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">that back and forth happens that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">after you&#39;ve heard somebody&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">their values and the complexity of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">because that sets you up to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">really great curious questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">going to move you along</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">yeah great great question</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">did you have a follow-up andy</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">okay evan would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">sure thanks so um i really love this</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">methodology for running a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">style discussion uh but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">heavily relies on the top-down control</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">structure of the teacher who has</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">institutional authority determining the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">ground rules for interaction in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">classroom</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:18.320" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious about your thoughts as to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">how we can use this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.320" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">and the kind of wild west of modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">political and social discourse</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">specifically because the ground rules of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">debate are often themselves points of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">extreme contention so for example we</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">look at the debate playing out in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">news right now regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">presidential debate structure where</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">muting</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">candidates during the other candidates</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">specifically allotted time</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">is highly contentious and being resisted</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">by one of the campaigns so just curious</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">know your thoughts on that because i</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">love the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s where something we talk a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">lot about is preparation</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">if people aren&#39;t going to buy into those</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">basic ground rules this would be almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">impossible to use</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">i do think the killer curious question</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">is really useful that&#39;s something i take</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">out even if we haven&#39;t had this</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">about how what rules we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">operate by even if we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">um a couple of you guys when i first</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">came in i&#39;ve got this little ninja</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">um that is my zoom icon that came from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">group of faculty who talked about being</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">a dialogue ninja in faculty meetings</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">which can be truly terrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">where they would even if they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">the authority in the room</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">they&#39;ve started using some of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">techniques to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">um you know i don&#39;t think you&#39;re in you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">know you didn&#39;t mean for that to sound</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">right and i don&#39;t think your intentions</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">were bad but it really landed that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">on me do you think you could say that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">and they just kind of back it up before</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">it explodes in the room</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">because that&#39;s another thing we talk a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">lot about in the work is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">between intention and impact</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">and if those things aren&#39;t aligned</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">that&#39;s when things can go badly really</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:01.599" style="s2">but back to your debate question i</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">again the one reason this works in</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.599" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">classrooms is because we co-create those</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">agreements</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re right we co-create them</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">because i make them do it because i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">the authority in the room</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">that&#39;s much more difficult in a much</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">more lateral situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">um but i do think i found myself sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">out in the wild</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">using a lot of these ideas my students</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">have as well they&#39;ll come back and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">report</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">that they&#39;ve just learned to ask that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">curious question about the experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">that leads to the belief</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">a couple of years ago a student walked</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">up to me during my office hours and she</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">i thought she was there for a paper or</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">something she&#39;s like i just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">thank you thanksgiving was so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">she had managed to ask yeah she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">polarized from her family and she&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">managed to actually just ask</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">could you just tell me a story that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">would help me understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">like it took everything she had in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:55.839" style="s2">moment to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">back it off and ask and turns out there</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.839" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">was something</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">really deep in the story where they</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">could relate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">have a more real conversation over</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">something that was very contentious</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">and she could remember their</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">relationship better in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s something i think people are</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">able to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">right and to remember your own good</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">intentions and that&#39;s what i love about</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">question it asks about your intentions</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">in a conversation</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">intention instead of just feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">body below impact</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">when somebody says something that just</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">lays you out because it goes against</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">something that you hold dear</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">for the price of your email address</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">think is another place that they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">some publicly available materials</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">so congregations that might be divided</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">over sexuality or other issues</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">let me i&#39;ll get that up for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">jill do you have any other suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">of how one</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">can personally develop their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">of asking more curious questions or</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">developing their own questions of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">i think just the practice of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">reflective moment that taking a breath</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">um sometimes i&#39;ll ask myself did i take</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">a breath or did i just react</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">right because your brain is geared to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">react one reason this is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">hard if</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">your brain can&#39;t tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">between a physical threat and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">viewpoint threat so when somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">the thing you&#39;re responding as if they</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">literally are trying to hit you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">that has been really useful information</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">for me to have because i can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">say okay i&#39;m triggered into fight flight</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">or freeze</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">and my that means i don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">my rational brain right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">and it&#39;ll probably be about 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">before i do again</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">so if i can take a breath and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">shift over</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">and then come back the coming back is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">but if i can come back into the space</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">and say so</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">then i can come up with that great</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">curious question</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">but yeah just knowing your own</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">limitations about that and but also</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">knowing your strengths where can you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">lean in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">right so i&#39;m a teacher i&#39;m pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">at coming up with questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">moment to move a conversation along</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">amongst people who probably want to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">taking a nap</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">all right um i can lean into those</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">strengths</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">you know and maybe in the if especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">if it&#39;s a group</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">ask one person that one curious question</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">that might help us go</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">you know so if your job is you know my</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">husband works with spreadsheets all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.800" style="s2">um you know his job is you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">really good at organizing and sorting</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.800" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">stuff out he might be better at taking</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">more organizational approach to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">kind of thing because that&#39;s how his</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">mind works</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">um but yeah just a lot of practice until</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">the question that you would normally</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">never ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">becomes something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">it takes i&#39;m an introvert it takes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">of bravery i never</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">thought i had um</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">uh that&#39;s really useful the question you</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">never thought you&#39;d ask becomes your</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">norm</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;m working on it um and but also know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">when maybe it&#39;s not going to get you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">if your intention may be something but</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">the impact may be different too</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s your own intention</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">impact gap you got to be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">is this really going to be helpful in</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">this moment</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">teenager</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m just wondering um as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">facilitator myself it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">a challenge to always understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">pull the group</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.119" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">in in that sort of pregame capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">actually do this work together or any</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">work frankly</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">and i was just wondering how you might</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">help gather your students</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">to ground them to get them ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">present because i do think especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">for gen</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">z&#39;s and i really don&#39;t want to pick on a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">generation but i live with one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">those members i know how many</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">distractions and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">uh how tempting it is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">be absorbed in other things that do not</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">require the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">type of human groundedness to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">to you know interact with and to relate</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">to humans all the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">yeah now that&#39;s a great question thank</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">so another principle of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear a lot if you hang out with</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">essential partners people</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">is connection before content people</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">before process</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s something i have taken to heart</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">i connect my classes now before we start</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">and right now it&#39;s super challenging</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got about</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">14 of them on zoom and four in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">physical classroom and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">bridge the zoom room</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">gap um amongst all the other gaps we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">normally trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">so one thing i found really effective</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">and we did this i was just teaching at a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">high school about this stuff and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">worked for that age group as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">is to just do a connected moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">um so for the high school because we</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">were virtual we just we put them into</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">smaller zoom room breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">and asked a connective question um so it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">was what band or artists get to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.960" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">right talk about that and we had them</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">model the weather forecast for their</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">mood they were in that day</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">something you&#39;re recently in love with</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">is a great question</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">one good thing about today is another</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">one that i really like</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">my students here on campus just did some</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">beautiful things with that one</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">today we did one thing you said hello to</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">maybe one thing you&#39;re worried about so</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">questions that allow people to share</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">something that&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">i mean one thing you&#39;ll notice in those</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">agreements is we can pass or pass for</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">i need to give people agency over what</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">they say in a room where they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">with their best friends</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">they&#39;re you know with people they may</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">even be opposed to on campus</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">so it has to be something you could</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">answer in any number of ways and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">choose the depth</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">to which you&#39;re going to go into which</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">you will share</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">but i am i will now take about three or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">four minutes the beginning of every</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">class to make sure we just have that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.319" style="s2">moment so we can be in a space together</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">and as a teacher it&#39;s fabulous because i</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.319" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">can get a read on the room</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">um the other thing i did for this</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">semester is give people emojis</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">and because i can&#39;t see them behind the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">masks and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">i was doing emoji check-ins how are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.319" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">feeling and the day that they all held</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">up the anxiety emoji i knew we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">take a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">talk about what was in the room super</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be in the room no matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">what it&#39;s better if you know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">and you know getting back to teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">they want that they really like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">they like being listened to that way</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">and interacting with peers that way i</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">find that to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">native motivation for them they think</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">it&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure my kids would think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">fun if i went home and asked them to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s fun if somebody they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">related to and in a bigger social group</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">ask them to do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">uh toure invitation to ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">thanks um i was just wondering how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">can explore</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">with curiosity if someone feels like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">you have it ulterior motives or just</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">like generally</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t comfortable with being vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">you sort of touched on this in the last</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">statement that you made around like</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">establishing the connection before the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">um but i&#39;m wondering if you have more</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">on how for people that have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">armoring yeah uh what</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">what how how do we switch how can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">help engage them into like switching</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">into that curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">and let them know it&#39;s like a safe place</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">yeah i think well i think the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">thing i would say it&#39;s never completely</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">safe but it has to be a brave</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">space and a safe enough space yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">we do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">through kind of relentless scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">so you don&#39;t start with the gun dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">the first day</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">not happening um i talk to students</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:39.040" style="s2">having a dialogic classroom what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">means to be in a dialogic classroom</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.040" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">they i have them do something called the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">open mind platform that heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">academy puts out</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">and this is something that gets them</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">into the language</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">of being open-minded and curious about</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">and then we do these connective</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">exercises i have them do that questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">of persuasion and understanding we</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">those agreements for the room and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">we can start having the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">and for most students that&#39;s enough it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">gets them</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">feeling like they are supported and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to fall into a black</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:17.839" style="s2">the other thing about the dialogues is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">you always have that option to pass or</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.839" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">pass for now</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">and you always choose the story you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">so students will self-regulate rightly</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:29.920" style="s2">so and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">go really pretty deep um</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.920" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">amazingly so and some of them are more</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">reserved because they never</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">feel that that&#39;s appropriate for them</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">so this is it helps and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not in a classroom environment and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">you know in that container and so as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">thinking about how to apply this to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">everyday life right that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">that environment isn&#39;t the everyday</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">environment and so i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:50:59.700" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">is like um</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.700" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">a way to create that without having all</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">you know that prior environment that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">comes with education is wonderful but</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">what about on the streets what about</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">you know one-on-one and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">parking lot i mean how do you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">you know those connective questions are</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been doing a lot of this work</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">where i&#39;ll be with like a non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll just go around the circle</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">and have you know you say your name</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">and then one thing you&#39;re recently in</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">love with and i just</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">watched the barriers sort of go away in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">the room</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">because they realize that two of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">have had coveted gardens or a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">them have puppies or</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">they&#39;re able to make that connection at</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">a human level and that sets up the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">conditions under which</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">we could start having these</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">conversations yeah um and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right about like the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">store um</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">so i think not just starting with hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">who you voting for</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">but talk about one good thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">happened to you lately what are you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">hope is a really powerful concept</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">all right so what are you hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">lately</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">where are your hopes lie i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.640" style="s2">a way of rolling back from issues and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">into the values under the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">make people able to speak about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">true for them in a way that isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">confrontational</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">jeff would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">all right i&#39;ll give it a go just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">just read it though</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">uh heavy response surveys measured</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:41.040" style="s2">retention of content</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">uh what you showed us was it was an</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.040" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">impressive uh attitude change</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">and it kind of kind of measures up with</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">with some experiences i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">but but of course this is a the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">range is short i don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">people have</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">been in a while but have you tried so um</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">what we have is you know professors will</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">come back and say that students and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">we&#39;re generally doing better in classes</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">so we have sort of anecdotal evidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">because that was not measured in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">surveys we can&#39;t put it forth as you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">research stuff but what part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">research study also we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">interviewed professors about what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">were doing in classes and what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">hoped to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">and in the course of those interviews we</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">had professors talking about students</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">doing better on</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">tests and then i can also tell you from</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">the student responses</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">they were spelling the name of french</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">theorists right six weeks later</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">which is not normal because they had</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">had that theorist presented to them</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.800" style="s2">along with a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">and so again all the anecdotal evidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.800" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">would support the students report that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">they&#39;re actually learning stuff better</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">this is research i really want to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">really really really want to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for funding to do a much</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.480" style="s2">more broad scale</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">study that would actually incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.480" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">that and then also</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">how this may be either proportionally or</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">disproportionately spread across</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:04.960" style="s2">different identity groups as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.200" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t really we coded for</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">gender and class status so like</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">sophomore</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">freshman freshman senior but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">dig into things like first generational</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">status</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">um or ethnicity in the survey that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">did and we think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s research that we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">you going forward</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">i think i think i&#39;ve sold that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s at least very plausible in the in</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">in the classroom setting where you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">an extended engagement</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">um but for people who are just</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">meeting up for for an hour wondering</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">how we escaped the uh um</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">you know either agreed to disagree or</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">just talk about things that no one</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">could disagree about which is like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">know what your favorite animal is or</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.520" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">um so but but i think for the longer</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2">engagement it makes sense if people feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">safe and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna engage uh and they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">a lot there&#39;ll be a lot there for them</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">other questions yeah i think um</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll take one more before we wrap</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">it up um</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">sawyer did you want to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">yeah um my question was about</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">whether you&#39;ve run into um</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">students subjects people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">introducing to this concept</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">who are particularly resistant to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">and if there&#39;s any ways to help them</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">become more comfortable with it that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">found</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">yeah and i have students who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">terrified of this both so they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">of the two groups of students who i find</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">have a difficult time engaging initially</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">students who feel like it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">trojan horse where i&#39;m trying to convert</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">them into some sort of viewpoint they</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.319" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">don&#39;t natively hold</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">um and they that the discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">open-mindedness they&#39;re like no i know</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">what i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">and then students who are on that more</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">vulnerable side who</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">really are uncomfortable being asked and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">to engage this way</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">um and that takes some scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">and experience i asked them just to try</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">it and i point out that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">to share anything they don&#39;t they could</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">pass the entire time that would be fine</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">um but that maybe they should think</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.799" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">um trying to listen to understand um</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">and a couple of things and that app is</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">really has been really really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">for me because it&#39;s not me talking to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">them it&#39;s the app and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.839" style="s2">gamified and they level up and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">um and it&#39;s sort of businessy in its</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.839" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">so for my students coming from that</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">business school world</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">it kind of sells them on open mind and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:53.359" style="s2">this is the stance they might at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">want to try</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">and then for my students on that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">reluctant side because they</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">feel like they want to be more sheltered</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">and about their own identity their</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">response has been overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">positive once they&#39;ve done one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">dialogues and understood what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">i&#39;m remembering a particular student who</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">came up to me after our first one</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:18.720" style="s2">in a class and just said i was so</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">skeptical of this i didn&#39;t think i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.720" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">want to share</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:22.880" style="s2">anything i just had this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.880" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">this is great for the first time ever i</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">feel like i&#39;m sharing</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">things that matter with classmates and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">we&#39;re not just talking about stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">um so for her it was a matter of trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">um and i i&#39;ve been amazed that i</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">really don&#39;t have dissenters like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">students universally are coming back and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">saying that this is something they want</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:51.520" style="s2">other places they&#39;re trying to embark on</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">in other places in their life</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.520" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">and it made the course better for them</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.440" end="00:57:57.119" style="s2">no matter who they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">i would say you know if you break up</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">your campus social groups but it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">greek students my athletes</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">my first gen students my immigrant kids</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">they all are finding a way to intersect</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">with it and it&#39;s just making class a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">more interesting for them frankly</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">than listening to me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s so far just been a matter</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">having them try getting beefed up the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">place where they think they can try it</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">and then they kind of carry it from</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">i facilitate they&#39;re trying it and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">they take it forward</p>
