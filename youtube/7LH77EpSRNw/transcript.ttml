<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">of the book the point of that campaign</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">is to help finance Daniel who&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:42.620" style="s2">sort of working full-time on many</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">aspects of the book so that he can</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.620" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">decrease the time that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">take to get it out into the public so</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.390" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">longer video coming out I believe today</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">or tomorrow in which Daniel I discuss a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">greater length the content of the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">what the books trying to do how it links</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">up with the work I do the work I&#39;ve done</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">out of the book it&#39;s going towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">supporting Daniel and he undertakes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">job of working on it doing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">writing a lot of the promotional work</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">developing a lot of the art etc so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">turn to some of the questions I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">already had a Quick Looks with some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">them I just want to make an overall</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">comment I&#39;m very appreciative of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">quality of the conversations that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">the insight and the acumen that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">are bringing to bear and so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">very much for that so the first question</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">is from patreon supporter Felix the</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">think our imagination or experience or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">determine</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">by being body beings and with reference</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:29.460" style="s2">think we are determined as body beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">to seeing the world itself as body or</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.460" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">bodies many thanks as always for your</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">fantastic work Thank You first of all</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">Felix for your kind words so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">take there&#39;s a couple of things in there</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">let&#39;s take them bit by bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">the first one is lake off the work of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:49.590" style="s2">like off often in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">Johnson Lake often Johnston so some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">you may know this because I mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">in the video series I could work with</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:57.380" style="s2">John Kennedy in in the 90s and the early</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">noughties</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.380" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">critiquing not just criticizing but</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">critiquing the work of Lake often</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">Johnson and the idea that our abstract</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">cognition is deeply influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">fact that we are embodied in Vedic</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">beings was one of the central ideas so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">to give you know a famous example that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">talked about in the in the series and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:23.640" style="s2">there was the central example of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:25.670" style="s2">first big book metaphors we live by we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.640" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">tend to talk about philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.670" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">abstract argumentation using the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">language of war like he attacked my</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">position or I defended my position or he</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">undermined what I was trying to say etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">and then the idea is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">embodied beings we make use of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">fundamental way of making sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">world is embodied interaction and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">create these patterns and then we use</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">those patterns like in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:04:00.450" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility for more</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:04.769" style="s2">abstract domains now I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.450" end="00:04:07.170" style="s2">that conceptual thought abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.769" end="00:04:10.980" style="s2">conceptual thought is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.170" end="00:04:12.209" style="s2">grounded in sensory motor interaction I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.980" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">think that&#39;s an important one I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.209" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a pivotal thesis of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">4e cognitive science Tversky Barbour</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:22.020" style="s2">Tversky the famous Tversky of Kahneman</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:22.910" style="s2">Tversky has a new book out all mind in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.020" end="00:04:24.110" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.910" end="00:04:25.970" style="s2">where she thought tries to argue very</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.110" end="00:04:29.750" style="s2">deeply in John Kennedy and I made a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.970" end="00:04:31.310" style="s2">similar argument in 2004 that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.750" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">our thinking is ultimately grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.310" end="00:04:35.420" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re spatial and that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">are navigating through space and that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.420" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">use all of these spatial relations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:43.580" style="s2">our navigational skills and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:46.820" style="s2">perspective all awareness in you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.580" end="00:04:49.730" style="s2">the three-dimensional lives space in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.820" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">order to inform constrain and render</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.730" end="00:04:56.540" style="s2">intelligible a lot of our abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:59.750" style="s2">thought and so I think all of this I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.540" end="00:05:02.810" style="s2">think is central like I think it goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.750" end="00:05:04.640" style="s2">back altum Utley to the just seminal</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.810" end="00:05:06.350" style="s2">work of merleau-ponty the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.640" end="00:05:12.200" style="s2">of perception and which has deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.350" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">informed for ich oxide so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.200" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">phenomena of the rounding relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:23.960" style="s2">between intelligence and embodiment I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:25.670" style="s2">think that is deeply right I argue for</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.960" end="00:05:29.270" style="s2">example in my work on relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.670" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">realization that it is the bile economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.270" end="00:05:34.820" style="s2">constraints of the body that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.310" end="00:05:38.030" style="s2">put the constraints on the problem space</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:41.419" style="s2">in problem-solving that actually afford</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.030" end="00:05:43.790" style="s2">us being adaptive intelligent beings so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.419" end="00:05:45.530" style="s2">that if we if our brains weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.790" end="00:05:46.790" style="s2">embodied I don&#39;t even know what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:49.100" style="s2">could light would mean it&#39;s maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.790" end="00:05:51.650" style="s2">sort of disembodied computer thing but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.100" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">if our brains were not if our brains did</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.650" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">not have to be regulated by cost</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:56.930" style="s2">functions that our bio economic in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.220" end="00:05:59.000" style="s2">nature they would not have their</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.930" end="00:06:00.380" style="s2">adaptive functionality and this lines up</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.000" end="00:06:02.330" style="s2">with a lot of the arguments are made of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.380" end="00:06:04.490" style="s2">our relevance realization the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.330" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">in AI they&#39;re increasingly talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:09.320" style="s2">the important role of cost functions etc</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:11.900" style="s2">so all of that is you know the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.320" end="00:06:17.960" style="s2">which there&#39;s deep agreement with Lake</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.900" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">often Johnson but John and I also had</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.960" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">criticisms of Lake often Johnson because</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:26.060" style="s2">we tend to argue that they saw the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:28.640" style="s2">relation as very is very simplistic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.060" end="00:06:31.340" style="s2">to bottom up that all that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.640" end="00:06:33.800" style="s2">is there&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s in fear you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.340" end="00:06:35.479" style="s2">allow me a bit of a stretch their idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:36.020" style="s2">is that the abstract mind is type it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.479" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">aroused</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.020" end="00:06:40.729" style="s2">just an empty slate and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">sensorimotor behavior writes on it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.729" end="00:06:46.810" style="s2">then that&#39;s what gives us our you know</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:08:00.380" style="s2">up there&#39;s top-down and I&#39;ve proposed</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.409" end="00:08:03.550" style="s2">that the way we can make sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.380" end="00:08:05.659" style="s2">is through a more recent idea from</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.550" end="00:08:09.409" style="s2">Michael Anderson about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.659" end="00:08:11.210" style="s2">exaptation that we can take sensory</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.409" end="00:08:13.219" style="s2">motor processes and they can be exact</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.210" end="00:08:14.870" style="s2">&#39;add but when they are exactly they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.219" end="00:08:16.849" style="s2">new functions and new abilities they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.870" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">not simply mapped in a bottom-up fashion</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.849" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">there&#39;s also top-down constraints in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:23.779" style="s2">terms of you know the field</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">I&#39;m exacting it into it I take this</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.779" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">sensory motor pattern and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">exacting it into a new domain and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">new domain puts huge constraints and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:33.890" style="s2">a top-down abstract fashion it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">re-engineers</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.890" end="00:08:38.990" style="s2">just like I&#39;m using my tongue for speech</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:41.930" style="s2">even though it evolved for taste and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.990" end="00:08:43.880" style="s2">moving the food around in my mouth so</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.930" end="00:08:46.699" style="s2">this helps to explain why a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.880" end="00:08:49.790" style="s2">words that I used at the beginning he</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.699" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">attacked my argument don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.790" end="00:08:53.900" style="s2">the sensorimotor demeaning John and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:56.750" style="s2">pointed this out in 96 we pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.900" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">well yeah you can say he attacked my</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.750" end="00:09:01.670" style="s2">position but notice other words that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:03.170" style="s2">could use when I&#39;m attacking a castle</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.670" end="00:09:05.480" style="s2">like we assaulted or stormed the castle</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.170" end="00:09:06.680" style="s2">don&#39;t really work as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.480" end="00:09:09.650" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t say in a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.680" end="00:09:12.260" style="s2">argument he assaulted my my argument</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.650" end="00:09:14.540" style="s2">that that&#39;s fix people is weird or odd</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.260" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">or notice you can&#39;t transfer backwards</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.540" end="00:09:18.890" style="s2">you can&#39;t you know because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:21.530" style="s2">synonyms for he attacked my position is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.890" end="00:09:23.210" style="s2">he criticized my position now unless</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.530" end="00:09:25.940" style="s2">we&#39;re doing a Monty Python routine you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.210" end="00:09:28.190" style="s2">can&#39;t use that as you know as a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.940" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">for attacking the castle you know let us</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.190" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">criticize the castle it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">convey let&#39;s attack the council and try</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">to destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.430" style="s2">see so there&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.270" end="00:09:39.290" style="s2">complex relation and there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">I can say about this the point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.290" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">trying to make is I think the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:49.190" style="s2">issue is correct and deeply grateful to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:51.650" style="s2">lay coffin johnson for bringing that out</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.190" end="00:09:54.530" style="s2">I think the cognitive processes at work</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.650" end="00:09:56.750" style="s2">are much more sophisticated much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.530" end="00:09:58.190" style="s2">dynamical much more self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.750" end="00:10:01.250" style="s2">having a lot more to do with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.190" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">of exaptation then simply the straight</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.250" end="00:10:06.380" style="s2">mapping of what lay Kevin Johnson called</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:09.080" style="s2">image schemata now that goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.380" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">your second point do we have to see the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.080" end="00:10:13.940" style="s2">world as a body I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.940" end="00:10:18.950" style="s2">as I just tried to show we don&#39;t map all</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:21.230" style="s2">or you know maybe even some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.950" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">central properties of our embodied</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.230" end="00:10:28.250" style="s2">patterns up into our abstract conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:32.750" style="s2">and theoretical space so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.250" end="00:10:35.450" style="s2">quite possible that we may have to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.750" end="00:10:39.080" style="s2">the world in maybe some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.450" end="00:10:40.840" style="s2">terms that have to be shared are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.080" end="00:10:44.930" style="s2">continuous with our sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.840" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">interaction but I do think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.930" end="00:10:51.530" style="s2">possible to see reality not as a body</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:53.570" style="s2">they&#39;re of course famous traditions that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.530" end="00:10:57.560" style="s2">argue this deeply or the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.570" end="00:11:00.230" style="s2">tradition in the ancient West for</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.600" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">of the world what was ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.910" end="00:11:15.060" style="s2">case of a reality so I hope that answers</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">that very excellent question it was is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.060" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">complex question and and I point you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:22.290" style="s2">some of the episodes in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">awakening for the meaning crisis where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.290" end="00:11:32.250" style="s2">try to tackle it very deeply great</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.250" end="00:11:36.660" style="s2">McKenzie Levin hi it&#39;s good to hear from</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.920" end="00:11:37.350" style="s2">you a patreon supporter thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.660" end="00:11:38.820" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.350" end="00:11:40.260" style="s2">here&#39;s your question do you think our</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.820" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">culture will eventually adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.260" end="00:11:48.360" style="s2">widespread development and use of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:50.279" style="s2">institutions ah there&#39;s two there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.360" end="00:11:57.390" style="s2">ways I can turb for that question what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.279" end="00:12:00.839" style="s2">predict that it&#39;s going to happen no it</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.390" end="00:12:05.640" style="s2">ceteris paribus I don&#39;t think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.839" end="00:12:08.750" style="s2">our culture is awash in some very</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.640" end="00:12:14.700" style="s2">large-scale patterns of and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.750" end="00:12:19.350" style="s2">foolishness that are making change very</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.700" end="00:12:21.329" style="s2">intractable this is this is my best</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.350" end="00:12:22.980" style="s2">explanation for why we&#39;re not making the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.329" end="00:12:25.709" style="s2">transformations we need to save the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.980" end="00:12:29.910" style="s2">planet and to save our civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.709" end="00:12:32.279" style="s2">to save our social institutions now the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.910" end="00:12:34.470" style="s2">question might ask is it possible with</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.279" end="00:12:36.570" style="s2">our efforts and with a lot of teamwork</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.470" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">that we could make that transformation</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.570" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">yes I do think so so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:46.199" style="s2">avoid is any sense of complacency in</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">answering that question and in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.199" end="00:12:51.449" style="s2">positive manner I think unless we work</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">really hard really concerted and really</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.449" end="00:12:59.070" style="s2">smart I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">that transition to where our culture has</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.070" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">widespread development of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:11.010" style="s2">institutions I think it is rational to</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.010" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">therefore to work hard for it and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.560" end="00:13:19.670" style="s2">rational to believe that if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:22.550" style="s2">seed that could contribute significantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.670" end="00:13:25.540" style="s2">not solely but could could contribute</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.550" end="00:13:28.250" style="s2">significantly to addressing these other</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.020" end="00:14:12.620" style="s2">symbolism so I in order to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:15.530" style="s2">question honestly I would say something</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.620" end="00:14:17.960" style="s2">like what might I resolve to do but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.530" end="00:14:20.300" style="s2">I suppose I wouldn&#39;t try and hinge it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.960" end="00:14:22.970" style="s2">some pivotal moment of resolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.300" end="00:14:25.190" style="s2">because the evidence shows that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.970" end="00:14:28.130" style="s2">largely ineffective for transforming</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.190" end="00:14:31.550" style="s2">people&#39;s behavior what I&#39;ve intent</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.130" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2">instead tried to do is create a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.550" end="00:14:40.550" style="s2">in which behaviors are adopted initially</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">very sort of locally somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.550" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2">superficially and then they start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:49.010" style="s2">permeate of their own accord through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">rest of my life</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.010" end="00:14:54.640" style="s2">so for example I took up the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:58.940" style="s2">trying to record at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.640" end="00:15:01.130" style="s2">any of the cognitive biases that I had</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.940" end="00:15:02.600" style="s2">noticed throughout the day is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:07.790" style="s2">trying to Train active open mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.600" end="00:15:13.100" style="s2">and increase my rationality but what has</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.790" end="00:15:15.710" style="s2">happened in a way that is exemplary or</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.100" end="00:15:17.660" style="s2">yeah exemplary of this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.710" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">happening in many other places is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.660" end="00:15:21.830" style="s2">practice has taken on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:24.290" style="s2">it started to grow the journal is now</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.830" end="00:15:27.350" style="s2">almost has a perspective of presence for</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.290" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">me I often noticed things because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:30.950" style="s2">almost like I become aware because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:33.010" style="s2">think oh what would my</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.950" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">think about that which is kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.010" end="00:15:37.160" style="s2">interesting personification but you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:39.050" style="s2">because it&#39;s like what Socrates said is</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.160" end="00:15:40.279" style="s2">but he&#39;s gonna face this person no</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.050" end="00:15:42.589" style="s2">matter what when he goes home at night</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.279" end="00:15:45.019" style="s2">namely the Socrates that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.589" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">asked him to reflect on his day and also</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.019" end="00:15:49.370" style="s2">what&#39;s happened is I&#39;ve started to write</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">content in my journal other than just</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.370" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">the cognitive biases I started to notice</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:56.990" style="s2">more pervasive patterns and existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:16:00.019" style="s2">modes that might be contributing to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.990" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">self-deception so a weight this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.019" end="00:16:02.149" style="s2">interesting because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.760" style="s2">Buddhists talked about this if I you</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.149" end="00:16:07.070" style="s2">know drop by drop you fill up the jar is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.760" end="00:16:11.149" style="s2">so I start this very sort of easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.070" end="00:16:13.610" style="s2">practice right but I and you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.149" end="00:16:16.670" style="s2">located it on a you know regular time</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.610" end="00:16:20.630" style="s2">regular space so it&#39;s just repeated and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.670" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">then what happens is a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.630" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">practices just don&#39;t take and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:28.970" style="s2">understand that&#39;s the case but there</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.980" style="s2">seems to be a way of getting them so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.970" end="00:16:31.160" style="s2">they start to take on a life of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.980" end="00:16:33.470" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.160" end="00:16:35.510" style="s2">and they start to permeate and presents</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.470" end="00:16:37.490" style="s2">themselves in your life and in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.510" end="00:16:38.810" style="s2">reflective awareness in a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.490" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">comprehensive fashion they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.810" end="00:16:44.990" style="s2">percolate which seems to me to be a much</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:48.620" style="s2">more successful strategy than sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.990" end="00:16:50.930" style="s2">the resolve to attempts that seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.620" end="00:16:53.420" style="s2">the prototypical thing you do for new</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.930" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">year&#39;s resolutions so I found that a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.420" end="00:16:59.870" style="s2">much better strategy in general for</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:04.819" style="s2">trying to transfer my behavior generally</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.870" end="00:17:08.270" style="s2">try and find a habit that is easy to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.819" end="00:17:10.520" style="s2">start but has this potential to grow of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.270" end="00:17:12.860" style="s2">its own accord and take on a life of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">own and then sort of percolate and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:16.780" style="s2">permeate through your life in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:21.799" style="s2">cognition I found that a much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.780" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">successful strategy so that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.799" end="00:17:27.470" style="s2">would answer that question I hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:30.919" style="s2">ople to people okay so the next is from</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.470" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">a patreon supporter Sergey marker Kent</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.919" end="00:17:34.790" style="s2">giving the importance of wisdom for</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:36.470" style="s2">increasing personal and public good it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.790" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">seems a good idea to work on increasing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.470" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">personal wisdom what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">the possibility and means of pushing or</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:44.580" style="s2">nudging or even forcing someone to work</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">on increasing her wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.580" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">ah so that&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">because I have two different populations</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:17:59.220" style="s2">that I&#39;ve interacted with around that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">issue that have given me two very</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.220" end="00:18:03.000" style="s2">different sort of results and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.020" end="00:18:06.360" style="s2">have led me to a very similar conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.000" end="00:18:08.010" style="s2">one is when I&#39;ve worked with my students</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.360" end="00:18:09.720" style="s2">and I was actually talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.010" end="00:18:11.130" style="s2">yesterday in a lecture and of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.720" end="00:18:13.320" style="s2">teaching on the psychology of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.130" end="00:18:17.400" style="s2">about what you&#39;re actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.320" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">is induce aspiration two people by</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.400" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">trying to set up an agave for them if</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.490" style="s2">you can set up an agar game where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.700" end="00:18:25.320" style="s2">give them a bit of resolving inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.490" end="00:18:27.060" style="s2">conflict and anxiety so they can see a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.320" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">little bit more clearer and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.060" end="00:18:31.230" style="s2">start to realize some patterns start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:33.270" style="s2">see through some illusions start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.230" end="00:18:35.690" style="s2">break you know inappropriate framing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.270" end="00:18:38.520" style="s2">then they get better sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.690" end="00:18:40.350" style="s2">experiencing real patterns they get</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.520" end="00:18:42.060" style="s2">better at realizing and then they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.350" end="00:18:44.100" style="s2">turn that back onto themselves and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.060" end="00:18:46.980" style="s2">you start to sort of enact with them</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.100" end="00:18:49.140" style="s2">Anna Gauguin get that going then that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.980" end="00:18:50.970" style="s2">can actually help them to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.140" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">aspiration paradox they cannot because</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.970" end="00:18:54.600" style="s2">you can&#39;t infer your way through it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:57.390" style="s2">you can sort of an agog your way through</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.600" end="00:18:59.430" style="s2">it and then and then of course as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.390" end="00:19:02.300" style="s2">argued elsewhere that requires you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.430" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">actually give them you know inactive</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.300" end="00:19:08.250" style="s2">analogies that sort of point back to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:10.740" style="s2">life they&#39;re leading and forward to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.250" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">life they&#39;re going into and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.740" end="00:19:14.040" style="s2">we talked about this in class this has</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:16.500" style="s2">serious overlaps with techniques that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.040" end="00:19:18.840" style="s2">you use with in therapy I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.500" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">do that now that counts as nudging I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.840" end="00:19:23.790" style="s2">think you can nudge people in that way</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:25.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s all I would ever try and do</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.790" end="00:19:29.400" style="s2">within an academic situation because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.500" end="00:19:32.210" style="s2">dealing with autonomous adults who I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.400" end="00:19:34.560" style="s2">not have any authority over other than</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.210" end="00:19:36.120" style="s2">scholastic Authority and with my</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.560" end="00:19:38.010" style="s2">children it&#39;s a different thing because</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.120" end="00:19:39.510" style="s2">I have parental authority over them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.010" end="00:19:42.180" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do something much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.510" end="00:19:44.490" style="s2">profound and I have permission in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.180" end="00:19:46.170" style="s2">have obligation to intervene to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.490" end="00:19:47.820" style="s2">intervene and perhaps interfere</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.170" end="00:19:50.430" style="s2">intervene in their lives in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.820" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">profound manner and what what happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.430" end="00:19:56.910" style="s2">there is I have realized how often I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:58.800" style="s2">have foolishly mistaken the thought that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.910" end="00:20:00.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve been foolish ly mistake</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.800" end="00:20:02.450" style="s2">in thinking that I could push people</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:05.010" style="s2">into wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.450" end="00:20:09.810" style="s2">trying to push my sons to be more wise</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.010" end="00:20:11.400" style="s2">has often had the opposite effect so</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.810" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">there&#39;s been significant failure on my</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.400" end="00:20:18.990" style="s2">part and I tried to learn from that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:24.060" style="s2">points me back to paying more attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.990" end="00:20:28.770" style="s2">to how much implicit narcissism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.060" end="00:20:34.170" style="s2">hubris can haunt even our what we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.770" end="00:20:35.940" style="s2">are even our noblest goals so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.170" end="00:20:37.680" style="s2">important thing I I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.940" end="00:20:40.110" style="s2">anybody other than a god this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.680" end="00:20:42.200" style="s2">Socrates&#39;s idea has the wisdom to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.110" end="00:20:44.820" style="s2">and push wisdom on to anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.200" end="00:20:46.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m concluding for that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.820" end="00:20:49.230" style="s2">seems to have worked with my older son</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.890" end="00:20:51.390" style="s2">my younger son is 15 and he&#39;s still of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.230" end="00:20:53.340" style="s2">course in transition in profound ways</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.570" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">arguments they do not they cannot find</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.940" end="00:30:23.320" style="s2">within Buddhist modernism write anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:25.210" style="s2">that addresses this concern that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.320" end="00:30:29.559" style="s2">just raised and these are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.210" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">sensitive deeply deeply people have</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.290" end="00:30:40.450" style="s2">not external critics or dilettante and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.830" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">these are people of deep integrity</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.450" end="00:30:45.400" style="s2">people who have you know we&#39;re deeply</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.400" end="00:30:53.380" style="s2">friendly to Buddhism making this point</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.540" end="00:30:55.059" style="s2">so that&#39;s what my concern is that also</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.380" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">helps to explain why I think for many</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.059" end="00:31:00.270" style="s2">people it&#39;s one of the fastest-growing</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:02.590" style="s2">demographics the nuns enno NES the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.270" end="00:31:03.730" style="s2">established religions don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.590" end="00:31:06.700" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.730" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2">because how they sort of mesh with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.700" end="00:31:11.410" style="s2">without getting into sort of magical new</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:14.350" style="s2">agey kind of thinking how religions mesh</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.410" end="00:31:16.540" style="s2">with the scientific worldview measure</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.350" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">measure would mesh with this hyper</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.540" end="00:31:21.850" style="s2">technology and mesh with the way the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:23.710" style="s2">science and the hyper technology are on</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.850" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">ways that were often not even very aware</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.710" end="00:31:31.830" style="s2">or aware of fundamentally altering our</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:35.470" style="s2">cognition I don&#39;t see them I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.830" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">that being done and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.470" end="00:31:43.570" style="s2">why the nuns are in that why that number</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:45.550" style="s2">is increasing increasing so one more</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:47.650" style="s2">point on this isn&#39;t is a point that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.550" end="00:31:49.150" style="s2">made in a recent discussion with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.650" end="00:31:51.430" style="s2">Hall was a private discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.150" end="00:31:59.040" style="s2">Jordan gave me permission to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.430" end="00:32:01.060" style="s2">it answering that question means</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.040" end="00:32:04.150" style="s2">reformulating our thinking in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.060" end="00:32:06.220" style="s2">fundamental way to get us out of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.150" end="00:32:08.470" style="s2">kind of thinking that has put us into</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.220" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">the problems that we are facing right</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.470" end="00:32:14.140" style="s2">now this that we are facing such</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:16.510" style="s2">dramatic threats that we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.140" end="00:32:19.750" style="s2">in a dramatic way and I think in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.510" end="00:32:21.430" style="s2">sense we have to realize in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.750" end="00:32:26.770" style="s2">dramatically different way than we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.430" end="00:32:29.680" style="s2">before and it&#39;s unclear that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.770" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">timescale that the established religions</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.680" end="00:32:35.470" style="s2">typically take in order to make that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:36.910" style="s2">kind of fundamental transformation Paul</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.470" end="00:32:39.340" style="s2">very clay has made a very good point in</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.910" end="00:32:41.560" style="s2">other ways he uses it as they think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.340" end="00:32:43.180" style="s2">legitimate criticism against some of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.560" end="00:32:45.100" style="s2">ideas which is you know religions take a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.180" end="00:32:46.900" style="s2">long time to change because they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.100" end="00:32:50.110" style="s2">conservative because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.900" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">you know it&#39;s hard fought and hard-won</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.110" end="00:32:53.380" style="s2">wisdom and you you don&#39;t give it up</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:56.650" style="s2">easily and you don&#39;t just go with any</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.380" end="00:32:59.190" style="s2">new flashy idea that&#39;s true and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.650" end="00:33:01.810" style="s2">means that religions are very</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.190" end="00:33:04.870" style="s2">conservative and very slow in their</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.810" end="00:33:08.890" style="s2">capacity to change and we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.870" end="00:33:12.820" style="s2">time we don&#39;t have the luxury of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.890" end="00:33:14.770" style="s2">time so what is normally I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.820" end="00:33:16.710" style="s2">deeply agree with Paul what is normally</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:19.590" style="s2">a very adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.710" end="00:33:22.110" style="s2">feature of religions is one that in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.590" end="00:33:25.770" style="s2">context is maladaptive and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.110" end="00:33:27.929" style="s2">remember every adaptation necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.770" end="00:33:30.570" style="s2">has context in which it will be</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.929" end="00:33:33.779" style="s2">maladaptive so that&#39;s my answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.570" end="00:33:38.270" style="s2">question that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.779" end="00:33:42.539" style="s2">current religions are going to be right</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.270" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">solutions on mass again there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.539" end="00:33:46.649" style="s2">different versions of that question and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:49.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to answer them separately and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.649" end="00:33:51.539" style="s2">I would appreciate and I&#39;m requesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.080" end="00:33:56.220" style="s2">that people do not confuse those</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.539" end="00:33:58.649" style="s2">together I&#39;ve clearly said that I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.220" end="00:34:00.690" style="s2">that the individual religions sorry</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.649" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">religions could give people individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.690" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">and legitimate in that sense responses</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:08.820" style="s2">to the mean graces but here&#39;s my reasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">for suspecting that the existing</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.200" end="00:34:21.570" style="s2">argument that forecloses on religion I</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.530" end="00:34:23.609" style="s2">mean I could only do that if I had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.570" end="00:34:25.500" style="s2">comprehensive and complete theory of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.609" end="00:34:28.710" style="s2">religion I do not have such a theory</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.500" end="00:34:30.419" style="s2">I suspect that no one does so Jonathan</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.180" end="00:43:06.249" style="s2">couple of questions that are coming in</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:09.489" style="s2">live so here&#39;s one for Cara Mia Cynthia</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.249" end="00:43:11.589" style="s2">Clayton Thank You Cara Mia</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:21.910" style="s2">engagement the question is what are your</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.259" end="00:43:23.289" style="s2">latest ideas for lessening the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.910" end="00:43:30.549" style="s2">crisis through a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.289" end="00:43:32.170" style="s2">religion so I mean part of it goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.549" end="00:43:34.839" style="s2">towards what I was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.170" end="00:43:37.390" style="s2">some of my most recent ideas about are</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:41.799" style="s2">about trying to get this meta secular</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.390" end="00:43:43.660" style="s2">technology going and activate collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.799" end="00:43:45.789" style="s2">intelligence and exempt it into</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.660" end="00:43:46.989" style="s2">collective rationality and collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.789" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">wisdom and that&#39;s gonna have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.989" end="00:43:51.729" style="s2">antibiotic and analogic a de pls</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:53.949" style="s2">symbolic and aspirational aspect to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.729" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">so in that sense I and I know this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.949" end="00:43:56.589" style="s2">because I&#39;m even involved in circling</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">practices and some of these practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.589" end="00:44:00.819" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna have a kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:03.819" style="s2">religious feel to it even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.819" end="00:44:07.029" style="s2">not going to be dedicated towards sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.819" end="00:44:08.979" style="s2">of some prototypical features of many</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.029" end="00:44:13.150" style="s2">religions and it&#39;s not going to be based</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.979" end="00:44:19.749" style="s2">on the ontology of those existing</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.150" end="00:44:22.809" style="s2">religions so that&#39;s one thing the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.749" end="00:44:27.099" style="s2">thing is there&#39;s a bunch of ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.809" end="00:44:29.469" style="s2">are coming out right now and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.099" end="00:44:32.559" style="s2">to ask for some patience on this because</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.469" end="00:44:35.589" style="s2">they&#39;re actually emerging in my ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.559" end="00:44:37.029" style="s2">discussion with Jordan Hall so Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.589" end="00:44:38.680" style="s2">and I had a recent conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.029" end="00:44:39.869" style="s2">specifically on the religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:42.699" style="s2">a religion and some of the powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.869" end="00:44:45.789" style="s2">ideas that were coming out of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.699" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">discussion we&#39;re not prepared yet to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.789" end="00:44:49.509" style="s2">release that publicly we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:54.279" style="s2">have a couple more discussions and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.509" end="00:44:56.140" style="s2">come back and and release that I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.279" end="00:44:57.620" style="s2">point you to something else I had an</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.140" end="00:44:59.540" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.620" end="00:45:01.220" style="s2">I&#39;m very grateful to a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.540" end="00:45:03.230" style="s2">Andrew Sweeney about this it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.220" end="00:45:05.300" style="s2">come out on his channel and it he asked</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">me a bunch of excellent questions about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.300" end="00:45:08.690" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:11.650" style="s2">because I&#39;m running out of time here</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.690" end="00:45:14.270" style="s2">there was a long I had a much longer</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.650" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">space there and forum and it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.270" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">dialogic because he was asking me</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:20.090" style="s2">questions and probing in which I try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:23.450" style="s2">answer that question in depth so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.090" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">giving you I&#39;m trying not to do a</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.450" end="00:45:28.390" style="s2">cop-out here I&#39;m saying there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:30.350" style="s2">you can go to look at those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.390" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">Andrews going to release the video</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.350" end="00:45:38.750" style="s2">shortly I believe Angelus also written a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">really good commentary on medium about</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.750" end="00:45:41.870" style="s2">my arguments and ideas about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">religion they&#39;re not religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.870" end="00:45:45.310" style="s2">already up there I recommend you go</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:47.780" style="s2">there and take a look at that and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.310" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">in addition to that the promise that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.780" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">Jordan Hall and I are going to shortly</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:59.210" style="s2">in the future again in dialogue format</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:46:00.770" style="s2">release a video about getting much</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.210" end="00:46:04.220" style="s2">clearer about what we mean what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.770" end="00:46:05.480" style="s2">talking about and some newer ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.220" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">connection that with that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.480" end="00:46:09.530" style="s2">remind people something that I keep</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">saying we&#39;re not trying to found a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.530" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">religion or anything like that please</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:18.020" style="s2">that is not what is going on neither are</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:21.320" style="s2">we trying to destroy any existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.020" end="00:46:24.230" style="s2">religions there is something happening</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.320" end="00:46:29.570" style="s2">right now there are emerging communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.230" end="00:46:33.710" style="s2">of practice and they often approached me</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.570" end="00:46:36.680" style="s2">because they hope that the work I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.710" end="00:46:38.750" style="s2">done can help them to communicate to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.680" end="00:46:41.660" style="s2">train to connect with other such</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.750" end="00:46:45.020" style="s2">communities and instead of just doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.660" end="00:46:47.510" style="s2">that sort of haphazard it&#39;s the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.020" end="00:46:49.670" style="s2">like no no can we do this in a highly</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.510" end="00:46:51.170" style="s2">reflective fashion can I do it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.670" end="00:46:54.530" style="s2">conjunction with some of the brightest</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.170" end="00:46:55.940" style="s2">and best and committed minds on this can</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.530" end="00:46:59.240" style="s2">I do it in conjunction with this project</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.940" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">about you know dialectic and deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.240" end="00:47:06.680" style="s2">so that we can perhaps guide and like</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:08.390" style="s2">this emerging process so that it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.680" end="00:47:11.540" style="s2">address the meeting crisis more</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.390" end="00:47:14.470" style="s2">comprehensively and more effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.540" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">hopefully also right thereby also</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.470" end="00:47:22.070" style="s2">provide a community network of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:24.890" style="s2">communities in which we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.070" end="00:47:28.040" style="s2">also as we resolve issues around meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.890" end="00:47:29.690" style="s2">start to bring wisdom to the problems in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.040" end="00:47:32.930" style="s2">the world right now that are exigent</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.690" end="00:47:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the project so please understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.930" end="00:47:42.770" style="s2">it that way so another question seen any</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.840" end="00:47:45.410" style="s2">good movies lately um yeah I have I went</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.770" end="00:47:49.820" style="s2">with my two cents or recently to see</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.410" end="00:47:51.290" style="s2">19:17 and I was deeply impressed movies</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.820" end="00:47:53.620" style="s2">that really impressed me are movies in</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.290" end="00:47:55.970" style="s2">which there&#39;s this wonderful consonant</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.620" end="00:47:58.580" style="s2">between the use of the format and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.970" end="00:48:00.080" style="s2">content of the movie and the message of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.580" end="00:48:01.550" style="s2">the movie so like Lawrence of Arabia is</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.080" end="00:48:02.990" style="s2">a prototypical example of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.550" end="00:48:05.150" style="s2">you know David Lee just did this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.990" end="00:48:08.420" style="s2">thing and what I found was something</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.150" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">analogous in 1917 that I liked so they</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.420" end="00:48:14.420" style="s2">have this thing that&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:17.510" style="s2">of a it&#39;s write it if there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.420" end="00:48:19.310" style="s2">bit of manipulation but it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.510" end="00:48:21.800" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s like it&#39;s a continuous shot</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.310" end="00:48:23.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like real time continuous shot and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.800" end="00:48:27.590" style="s2">so you&#39;re following these two characters</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.720" end="00:48:29.990" style="s2">around right in real time as like in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.590" end="00:48:32.330" style="s2">continuous shot and when what that does</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.990" end="00:48:34.940" style="s2">is it gives you this immersive thing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.330" end="00:48:36.680" style="s2">right so you know we there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.940" end="00:48:38.360" style="s2">temptation with world wars to step back</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.680" end="00:48:40.700" style="s2">and think of a Nebraska all the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.360" end="00:48:42.110" style="s2">we do that is we turn off a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.700" end="00:48:44.330" style="s2">with cognitive science research shows</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.110" end="00:48:46.460" style="s2">right we turn off a lot of our moral and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.330" end="00:48:47.960" style="s2">empathetic machinery when we move to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.460" end="00:48:50.390" style="s2">this high level of control</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.960" end="00:48:52.520" style="s2">instead what 1917 is doing is keeping</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.390" end="00:48:55.550" style="s2">you really immersed so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.520" end="00:48:57.500" style="s2">standing back and reflecting on you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.550" end="00:49:00.830" style="s2">actually being present in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.500" end="00:49:02.570" style="s2">participatory way within the situation</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.830" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">and you know and so you&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.570" end="00:49:06.440" style="s2">engaged with this so what&#39;s happening of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:07.970" style="s2">course is you get a lot of effective</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.440" end="00:49:09.800" style="s2">responses because you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.970" end="00:49:11.990" style="s2">there&#39;s moments of fear there&#39;s moments</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.800" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">of heroism and you&#39;re getting all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.990" end="00:49:17.750" style="s2">that going on well of course or not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">not going to speak about specific stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.750" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want to do any spoilers</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:24.620" style="s2">but that immersive right presencing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:26.930" style="s2">infective and engagement is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.620" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">put you face-to-face and try to really</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.930" end="00:49:32.650" style="s2">hear what I&#39;m saying I said put you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:35.930" style="s2">face-to-face with the deep absurdity of</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.560" end="00:50:49.670" style="s2">having load approaches do people also</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.270" end="00:50:51.770" style="s2">try to solve having modes having</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.670" end="00:50:55.250" style="s2">problems from the beam oh yes they do</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.770" end="00:50:57.740" style="s2">and I mean so there&#39;s some one comic</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.250" end="00:50:59.800" style="s2">sometimes but they can be tragic and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.740" end="00:51:02.780" style="s2">can get instances of this in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.800" end="00:51:04.840" style="s2">where people need to do some very having</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.780" end="00:51:08.030" style="s2">mode things they need to go out you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.840" end="00:51:11.150" style="s2">let&#39;s say this is only meant to be one</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.030" end="00:51:12.190" style="s2">example they need to get a job they need</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.150" end="00:51:18.170" style="s2">to get a job</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.190" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">all right they need to have financial</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.170" end="00:51:22.370" style="s2">resources so that they can feed and take</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.390" end="00:51:24.050" style="s2">care of them so they need to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.370" end="00:51:28.040" style="s2">instead of doing that they go into this</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.050" end="00:51:30.770" style="s2">metaphysical abstraction about Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.040" end="00:51:34.070" style="s2">and what am I and what&#39;s ultimately real</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.770" end="00:51:35.420" style="s2">and what is a good human life these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.070" end="00:51:37.580" style="s2">all questions of course that should be</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.420" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2">asked they are being more questions but</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.580" end="00:51:41.180" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.150" end="00:51:44.809" style="s2">people are asking those questions as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.180" end="00:51:47.510" style="s2">way of actually avoiding the concrete</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.809" end="00:51:49.130" style="s2">practical task of getting a job and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.510" end="00:51:51.710" style="s2">getting food because you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.130" end="00:51:53.569" style="s2">job and have food they can often get</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.710" end="00:51:55.970" style="s2">stuck and they can get stuck in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.569" end="00:51:57.890" style="s2">a Peter Pan situation where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.970" end="00:52:00.619" style="s2">always contemplating all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.890" end="00:52:02.630" style="s2">metaphysical possibilities of who and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.619" end="00:52:04.730" style="s2">what they could be there I have so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.630" end="00:52:07.010" style="s2">potential I could be this I could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.730" end="00:52:08.270" style="s2">that I could be I could have this life I</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.010" end="00:52:09.950" style="s2">could have that and there are they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.270" end="00:52:14.210" style="s2">want to kill any of the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.950" end="00:52:19.010" style="s2">but decision means to cut and at some</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.210" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">point you have to stop glorying in all</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.010" end="00:52:25.369" style="s2">of the possibilities and actually do</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:28.220" style="s2">something that&#39;s of course why we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.369" end="00:52:31.010" style="s2">the myth of Peter Pan all right you</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.130" end="00:52:41.720" style="s2">mode of confusion in which you&#39;re</p>
