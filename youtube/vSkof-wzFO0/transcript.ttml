<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:45.990" style="s2">extent and nature of suffering and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.830" end="00:08:49.560" style="s2">that kind of forced how do we solve</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.990" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">distance so I was fortunate to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.560" end="00:08:56.310" style="s2">homeschooled growing up so I got to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:59.610" style="s2">exposed to kind of unusual things early</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.310" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">on because of that so these I&#39;ll share a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.610" end="00:09:03.750" style="s2">particular small set of crucible moments</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:06.930" style="s2">that first one I was maybe eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.750" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">years old saw a slaughter truck a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.930" end="00:09:14.370" style="s2">factory farm cattle slaughter truck and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:16.020" style="s2">looking in I saw cows in a in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.370" end="00:09:18.500" style="s2">condition that I had never seen animals</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.020" end="00:09:20.550" style="s2">in and it was like really</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.500" end="00:09:23.670" style="s2">existentially devastating for me because</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.550" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">it was so unbelievably protest which led</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.670" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">me to then go to a factory farm and just</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:29.010" style="s2">dive down the rabbit hole of what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:30.630" style="s2">happening and I grew up like so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.010" end="00:09:34.350" style="s2">people as someone who loved animals but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.630" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">also just didn&#39;t connect to what our</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.350" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">relationship to animals is at scale and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">that got me into activism and which</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:41.940" style="s2">started in animal rights and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">environmental work and then social</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.940" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">justice work it ended up turning out for</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">me that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">the suffering of any sentient thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:51.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t bother me more or less than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">other thing so whether we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">about factory farms or species</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:57.399" style="s2">extinction or whaling or extreme poverty</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">or they were just so completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.399" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">unacceptable that it&#39;s just like there</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">was no way through for me in life it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a way through for all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:08.890" style="s2">so this was the beginning of existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">devastation that led to of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.890" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">purpose as it often does for people</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">where the thing that happened for me was</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">like is there a model of success for my</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">life that isn&#39;t success for all of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">that&#39;s okay with me and the answer is of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:26.680" style="s2">course no right because if I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">excited about my own success with with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.680" end="00:10:31.089" style="s2">that degree of intensity of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:34.089" style="s2">through so much of the world I have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.089" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">be at least partially psychopathic I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.089" end="00:10:38.050" style="s2">have to be able to disconnect from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">experience of other sentient things so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.050" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">much and any success moment that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:45.880" style="s2">based on psychopathy wasn&#39;t compelling</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:49.180" style="s2">for me and so then that found my own</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.880" end="00:10:53.080" style="s2">life path and success definition</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:55.900" style="s2">with success for everybody right</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.080" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">then as I got deeply into activism I got</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.900" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">to see how profoundly interconnected the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.590" style="s2">different areas of problems in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:05.290" style="s2">work one of the early experiences was</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.590" end="00:11:07.330" style="s2">working on a elephant poaching project</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.290" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">and this solution was getting bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.330" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">fences around the preserves and harsher</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.940" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">sentencing for poachers but after a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:15.940" style="s2">tremendous amount of work and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.340" style="s2">succeeded in those elephants were being</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.940" end="00:11:21.070" style="s2">poached the underlying poverty of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.340" end="00:11:22.600" style="s2">poachers wasn&#39;t addressed the mindset of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.070" end="00:11:24.190" style="s2">people towards animals the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.600" end="00:11:25.750" style="s2">macroeconomic system that created</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.190" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">poverty the macroeconomic system by</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.750" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">which the animals were worth something</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:31.030" style="s2">dead and they weren&#39;t worth anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:32.770" style="s2">alive on anyone&#39;s balance sheet led the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.030" end="00:11:34.360" style="s2">same groups of people to start hunting</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.770" end="00:11:36.130" style="s2">the white rhino in the mountain gorillas</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.360" end="00:11:38.650" style="s2">and I saw that we just moved problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.130" end="00:11:40.660" style="s2">and that got me into systems analysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.650" end="00:11:42.190" style="s2">and doing deep systems analysis on how</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.660" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2">all the various issues were connected</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.190" end="00:11:45.790" style="s2">and it was that she became clear that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:47.320" style="s2">the deepest biggest existential issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.790" end="00:11:49.690" style="s2">were so profoundly interconnected they</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.320" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">weren&#39;t solvable in isolation and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.690" end="00:11:53.320" style="s2">not only were they not when were they</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">interconnected but that&#39;s a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.320" end="00:12:00.490" style="s2">same underlying structural drivers and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:12:03.840" style="s2">so the kind of the process crucible</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.490" end="00:12:06.100" style="s2">moment for me was wow there&#39;s profound</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.840" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">there&#39;s profound enough suffering that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.100" end="00:12:08.920" style="s2">just because we put it somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:10.750" style="s2">and don&#39;t look at it like this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.920" end="00:12:12.580" style="s2">a page just continue to not look at it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:13.930" style="s2">and I got to look at it enough that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.580" end="00:12:19.300" style="s2">could never stop thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.930" end="00:12:21.250" style="s2">and then and so we need to address a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.300" end="00:12:23.020" style="s2">of things and with solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.250" end="00:12:24.580" style="s2">fundamentally different in approach than</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.020" end="00:12:26.650" style="s2">almost anything currently happening and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.580" end="00:12:27.520" style="s2">so that really directed a life course</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.650" end="00:12:30.280" style="s2">for me of saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:31.560" style="s2">what are the deepest underlying causes</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.280" end="00:12:34.120" style="s2">of why all these things are happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.560" end="00:12:36.730" style="s2">what would it take to shift those causes</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.120" end="00:12:38.410" style="s2">and what is a blueprint or a set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.730" end="00:12:41.050" style="s2">criteria for blueprints for a future of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.410" end="00:12:43.480" style="s2">civilization that obsoletes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.050" end="00:12:46.150" style="s2">foundational causes of unnecessary human</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.480" end="00:12:48.610" style="s2">induced suffering in Canada at scale so</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.150" end="00:12:50.290" style="s2">it&#39;s awesome because my like completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.610" end="00:12:52.630" style="s2">depressed suicidal existential angst</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.290" end="00:12:54.730" style="s2">growing up with nightmares ended up</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.630" end="00:12:57.370" style="s2">leading of course to my recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.730" end="00:12:59.080" style="s2">that was that that was a tiny degree of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.370" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">suffering chimera what so many Wren and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.080" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">how do we solve that so that&#39;s an oyster</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:17.530" style="s2">thank you yeah I&#39;d love to share I I had</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:19.720" style="s2">a really beautiful group where we got to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.530" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">share some of these moments and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.720" end="00:13:26.770" style="s2">amazing gent coming by is just filling</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:28.570" style="s2">our ears so just excuse the noise yes my</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.770" end="00:13:31.260" style="s2">crucible moment you know I had an</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.570" end="00:13:34.390" style="s2">experience that we all have growing up</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.260" end="00:13:36.550" style="s2">which is that we learn from a very young</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.390" end="00:13:39.460" style="s2">developmental age that when we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.550" end="00:13:43.990" style="s2">something when we try to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.460" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">reality it responds and when you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.990" end="00:13:48.280" style="s2">that experience you can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">understand that you are the architect of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.280" end="00:13:53.380" style="s2">your universe and a favorite spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:55.900" style="s2">teacher said to me one day that I just</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:58.030" style="s2">loved which is that you are the universe</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.900" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">that you formerly thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.030" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">inside of this thing that you thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:06.400" style="s2">was just affecting you you are actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:10.810" style="s2">actively participating and creating it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.400" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">and so at a very precocious age maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.810" end="00:14:14.860" style="s2">many of you can relate I decided I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:16.830" style="s2">going to leave the world better than I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.860" end="00:14:18.390" style="s2">found it and I started saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.830" end="00:14:20.610" style="s2">when I was a really young little girl</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.390" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">way younger men could have actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.610" end="00:14:27.870" style="s2">taken any action but it drove me into</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:29.640" style="s2">environmental science and I kept that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.870" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">passion if I want to leave the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">better than I sounded like how many of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:35.610" style="s2">you kind of feel that in your bones</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:40.830" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">and so fast-forward I met the man of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.830" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">dreams I met Bryon Franklin who&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:48.140" style="s2">this audience my husband my partner in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:52.740" style="s2">crime my partner in life and in love and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.140" end="00:14:55.110" style="s2">I have been a voracious taking in like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.740" end="00:14:58.080" style="s2">was just voraciously taking in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.110" end="00:15:00.420" style="s2">teachings and ideas from the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.080" end="00:15:03.060" style="s2">thinkers of our time the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.420" end="00:15:06.840" style="s2">spiritual teachers of our time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.060" end="00:15:10.110" style="s2">seeking knowledge and on a very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.840" end="00:15:11.850" style="s2">faithful day we went to this breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.110" end="00:15:15.000" style="s2">and it was one of our first dates and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.850" end="00:15:19.230" style="s2">looks me in the eye right through man he</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.000" end="00:15:21.550" style="s2">says Jennifer you&#39;ve been a seeker your</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:29.770" style="s2">and what I see in you is a woman that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.020" end="00:15:32.770" style="s2">can become a deliverer and in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:35.620" style="s2">moment this man looking me in the eye</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.770" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">believing in me to be one of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.620" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">speakers teachers that I had been</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:44.890" style="s2">idolizing my whole life just seeking I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:48.670" style="s2">realized that what was next for me was</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.890" end="00:15:52.270" style="s2">to stand up and be a deliverer not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.670" end="00:15:53.980" style="s2">a seeker and what occurred for me in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.270" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2">that moment with this beautiful and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">was what the most enlightened man I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.720" end="00:15:58.300" style="s2">ever met in my life</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:16:00.910" style="s2">looking me in the eye and telling me</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.300" end="00:16:04.270" style="s2">this was that like so many of us I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.910" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">in my white ivory tower waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.270" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">someone else right thinking that I could</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:12.250" style="s2">eventually derive my strength if I read</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:15.760" style="s2">another book or went to another teacher</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.250" end="00:16:17.350" style="s2">or sought another course and realized</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.760" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">that the strength and courage that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.350" end="00:16:23.860" style="s2">needed to derive would not occur until</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:26.020" style="s2">my feet touch the ground which meant</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.860" end="00:16:28.450" style="s2">that I needed to actually begin to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.020" end="00:16:31.960" style="s2">deliver some of this work in the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.450" end="00:16:36.460" style="s2">and for me his belief in me his love of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.960" end="00:16:38.830" style="s2">me his championship of me was a crucible</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.460" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">moment and I began to teach and lead</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.830" end="00:16:44.170" style="s2">with him from that day forward in fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">he came to me one day after nine months</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.170" end="00:16:48.130" style="s2">of resistance going no no no no this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:50.170" style="s2">your job I this is not my job I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.130" end="00:16:53.020" style="s2">scientist I don&#39;t belong in front of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.170" end="00:16:58.930" style="s2">stages doing this who&#39;s gonna listen to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.020" end="00:17:03.070" style="s2">me right apparently and he looks me in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.930" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">the eye and with not a shred of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.070" end="00:17:12.040" style="s2">shrinking back he says Jennifer I refuse</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:14.410" style="s2">to stand up here one more day and do one</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.040" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">more course with you in the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.410" end="00:17:19.650" style="s2">room will</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:22.140" style="s2">handing out handouts because every word</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.650" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">coming from my mouth is sourced from us</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.140" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">and from you I am shutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">company and I will not teach anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:34.980" style="s2">without you here because your voice is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">needed so it wasn&#39;t just I believe in</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.980" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">you to become this I refuse to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:42.810" style="s2">another day without you doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:46.110" style="s2">that putting it on the line changed me</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.810" end="00:17:47.970" style="s2">forever and I am so grateful to this man</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.110" end="00:18:01.500" style="s2">and to the power of love in our lives to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.970" end="00:18:03.740" style="s2">do that for us alright that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.500" end="00:18:03.740" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.870" end="00:18:11.450" style="s2">my things just like maybe a little more</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:13.610" style="s2">greedy and practical like that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:23.750" style="s2">amazing I&#39;m like a normal person</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.610" end="00:18:27.169" style="s2">so like okay immigrant parents came to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.750" end="00:18:29.870" style="s2">the u.s. basically couldn&#39;t read or</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.169" end="00:18:31.970" style="s2">write any language as illiterate seven</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.870" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">so I only thought pictures and numbers</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.970" end="00:18:35.690" style="s2">which is not really a problem because</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:36.980" style="s2">there&#39;s still a lot of thinking you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.690" end="00:18:38.390" style="s2">do but kind of a problem because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.980" end="00:18:39.640" style="s2">can&#39;t make any friends which is fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.390" end="00:18:43.270" style="s2">that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.640" end="00:18:45.500" style="s2">spends a bunch of time instead like</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.270" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">trying to understand the universe so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.500" end="00:18:50.779" style="s2">like I was very excited about life as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:53.149" style="s2">kid like being in nature and studying</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.779" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">the Stars and got pretty far all those</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.149" end="00:18:58.909" style="s2">things and just like loved a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:19:01.309" style="s2">life then around like age 11 or 12 I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.909" end="00:19:04.970" style="s2">started to like recognize what the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.309" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">was actually like so I grew up a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.970" end="00:19:07.720" style="s2">the 80s so there&#39;s like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:09.740" style="s2">called mutually assured destruction</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.720" end="00:19:12.500" style="s2">where we had this thing where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.740" end="00:19:13.820" style="s2">our policy to like not get killed is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.500" end="00:19:16.580" style="s2">we&#39;ll kill all of them too</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.820" end="00:19:19.669" style="s2">that was like the official policy of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.580" end="00:19:20.750" style="s2">both the USSR and the USA around the use</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.669" end="00:19:22.580" style="s2">of nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.750" end="00:19:24.429" style="s2">it&#39;s like don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll kill all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.580" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">them if they try to kill us</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.429" end="00:19:29.659" style="s2">don&#39;t worry that&#39;s that&#39;s actually our</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:31.340" style="s2">strategy that&#39;s like what is this what</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.659" end="00:19:33.980" style="s2">adults do this is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.340" end="00:19:35.210" style="s2">and then like not that long afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.980" end="00:19:37.340" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing called the Savings</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.210" end="00:19:39.049" style="s2">and Loan scandal and like it was a major</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.340" end="00:19:41.390" style="s2">economic collapse not that different</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.049" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">than 2008 in retrospect we do this all</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.390" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">the time but at the time I was like how</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:47.419" style="s2">crazy is this because like a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:49.159" style="s2">number change somewhere and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.419" end="00:19:51.649" style="s2">literally a person jumping off of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.159" end="00:19:53.809" style="s2">50-story building because it&#39;s over for</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.649" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">them because a number changed and I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.809" end="00:19:58.850" style="s2">like we made this world we made a world</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:20:00.470" style="s2">where a number changes on a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.850" end="00:20:03.169" style="s2">and you jump out of a building</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.470" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">we made a world where our strategy to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.169" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">deal with peace is that we can bomb</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:08.820" style="s2">every single</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:10.920" style="s2">your cities three times over that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.820" end="00:20:13.560" style="s2">what we created and and this like I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.920" end="00:20:15.480" style="s2">realizing this around age 11 or 12 and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.560" end="00:20:17.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that feeling like oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.480" end="00:20:19.860" style="s2">like I&#39;ll just make this all better my</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.700" end="00:20:21.570" style="s2">my hope was like let me just get this</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.860" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">through this thing without making the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.570" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">world any worse because this is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2"> up I don&#39;t even want to be near</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:34.350" style="s2">this stuff the actual action I took was</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:36.300" style="s2">like at age 15 I started a punk rock</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.350" end="00:20:40.650" style="s2">band it was just like let&#39;s tear it all</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.300" end="00:20:42.330" style="s2">down let&#39;s tear it all down and I was in</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.650" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">like this very like angst all</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.330" end="00:20:47.160" style="s2">existential it&#39;s all up let me</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:48.390" style="s2">just try to get through it mode for</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.160" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">quite a little while actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.390" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t until I was maybe like 18</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.500" style="s2">or so that I heard this phrase and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.630" style="s2">can&#39;t find the source I&#39;ve tried look</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.500" end="00:20:59.130" style="s2">for it since I don&#39;t know maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.630" end="00:21:02.040" style="s2">like I made it up for myself but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.130" end="00:21:06.570" style="s2">like somebody told me this but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.040" end="00:21:10.050" style="s2">phrase was a a cynic is just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.570" end="00:21:12.330" style="s2">frustrated idealist and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.050" end="00:21:14.700" style="s2">initially I was like whatever that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.330" end="00:21:16.170" style="s2">weird thing to think and then like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.700" end="00:21:18.180" style="s2">know it&#39;s one of those things that stuck</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.170" end="00:21:20.010" style="s2">with me and that as I kept coming back</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.180" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">to I was like maybe well maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.010" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:24.210" style="s2">like I&#39;m so skinned cynical about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.950" end="00:21:27.270" style="s2">world because I&#39;m actually a frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.210" end="00:21:29.070" style="s2">idealist like maybe there is ideals that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.270" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2">I have maybe there is something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.070" end="00:21:34.890" style="s2">matters beyond just getting through this</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:36.630" style="s2">without making it any worse and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.890" end="00:21:38.070" style="s2">that started like a very long journey</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.630" end="00:21:39.780" style="s2">that&#39;s not all these different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.070" end="00:21:41.100" style="s2">it and none of it involves like all this</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.780" end="00:21:47.130" style="s2">amazing stuff that you guys did that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:48.510" style="s2">crazy well but it&#39;s just running very</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.130" end="00:21:50.190" style="s2">quickly through it so that was all</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.510" end="00:21:52.170" style="s2">happening I started to try to do some</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:21:53.500" style="s2">stuff but I sucked at it basically and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.170" end="00:21:55.059" style="s2">then when I was 20</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.500" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">almost died so that was the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.059" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">but maybe we&#39;ll skip it I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:02.470" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of interesting I almost died</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:05.890" style="s2">basically what happened was I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.470" end="00:22:07.419" style="s2">was like so good at like doing stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.890" end="00:22:08.919" style="s2">the existing system so like once I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.419" end="00:22:10.840" style="s2">actually put my mind to it and I stopped</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.919" end="00:22:12.250" style="s2">being a cynic I could actually get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.840" end="00:22:13.929" style="s2">of stuff done so it&#39;s getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.250" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">stuff done but so good at getting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.929" end="00:22:18.190" style="s2">done and I and my overall strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:20.409" style="s2">dealing with stress was like I will</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.190" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">internalize it and just work harder like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.409" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">my immigrant parents basically taught me</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:26.289" style="s2">just work harder and I would and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">only would I do do that for myself which</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.289" end="00:22:30.789" style="s2">worked fine as a strategy as I like got</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:32.650" style="s2">a team and became an executive and had</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.789" end="00:22:35.140" style="s2">more and more people reporting to me I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.650" end="00:22:36.760" style="s2">absorb all of their stress too because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.140" end="00:22:38.110" style="s2">was like I don&#39;t want you to stress let</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.760" end="00:22:39.730" style="s2">me take that on I don&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.110" end="00:22:42.100" style="s2">stress let me take that and I would just</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.730" end="00:22:44.620" style="s2">work that much harder that much harder</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.100" end="00:22:47.980" style="s2">that much harder at some point before</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.620" end="00:22:49.900" style="s2">age 30 almost did not make aged 30 I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.980" end="00:22:52.390" style="s2">internalized so much of that stress that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.900" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">basically my GI system stopped</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.390" end="00:22:58.690" style="s2">functioning just burst open and I lost</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:01.929" style="s2">40% of my blood in 30 minutes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.690" end="00:23:03.490" style="s2">the thing that can happen and in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.929" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">emergency room they gave me four</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.490" end="00:23:07.000" style="s2">simultaneous blood transfusions because</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:08.440" style="s2">it turns out that when you&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.000" end="00:23:08.830" style="s2">blood that fast they can&#39;t just give you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.440" end="00:23:10.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.830" end="00:23:13.419" style="s2">you&#39;ll still die they need to give you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.840" end="00:23:14.770" style="s2">four at once otherwise you will die so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.419" end="00:23:16.179" style="s2">they gave me four at once and it the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.770" end="00:23:19.210" style="s2">bleeding didn&#39;t stop quite yet so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.179" end="00:23:20.860" style="s2">gave me another 4:1 simultaneously again</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.210" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">after that and a couple more after that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.860" end="00:23:26.049" style="s2">but eventually it stabilized and I did</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:33.909" style="s2">not die nice job and I woke up the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.049" end="00:23:35.770" style="s2">morning so I woke up the next morning</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.909" end="00:23:37.900" style="s2">with two important realizations one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.770" end="00:23:39.780" style="s2">them was that human body is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.900" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">liquid and that liquid is mostly blood</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.780" end="00:23:44.710" style="s2">basically all my blood got replaced so</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:48.440" style="s2">I&#39;m mostly somebody else today</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.710" end="00:23:49.970" style="s2">and then like you know you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.440" end="00:23:51.980" style="s2">other realization was that I was only</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.970" end="00:23:53.749" style="s2">alive because of the generosity of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.980" end="00:23:56.539" style="s2">eight or more other people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.749" end="00:23:59.749" style="s2">never gonna meet and it&#39;s just like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.539" end="00:24:02.509" style="s2">sit back and you like recognize you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.749" end="00:24:02.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense like okay so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.509" end="00:24:05.119" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.899" end="00:24:07.070" style="s2">why people love Mike Rinna yeah take on</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.119" end="00:24:09.499" style="s2">more stress do it you can do it if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.070" end="00:24:11.359" style="s2">push harder work harder absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.499" end="00:24:14.389" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that hard work is not a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.359" end="00:24:16.669" style="s2">big deal it&#39;s not important do it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.389" end="00:24:18.980" style="s2">what I was also living at the age of 29</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.669" end="00:24:20.330" style="s2">was the belief that I would somehow need</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.980" end="00:24:23.299" style="s2">to shoulder all myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.330" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">and she like literally wake up in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.299" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">blood and the body of eight other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:29.179" style="s2">have recognized how connected and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.330" style="s2">supported I was by every other human</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.179" end="00:24:35.090" style="s2">being on earth then I was like no this</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.330" end="00:24:36.919" style="s2">is not me this is everybody but yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.090" end="00:24:38.659" style="s2">gonna work hard my</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.919" end="00:24:41.419" style="s2">working hard because all of you are in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.659" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">me and I am in all of you like let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.419" end="00:24:45.739" style="s2">this and when I got back to doing my</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:47.480" style="s2">work because I was an up-and-coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.739" end="00:24:49.340" style="s2">executive it changed everything about</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.480" end="00:24:51.830" style="s2">how I led and it took like years and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.340" end="00:24:53.419" style="s2">years for it to actually fully propagate</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.830" end="00:24:55.639" style="s2">and do all the experiments and like find</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.419" end="00:24:58.580" style="s2">a spot where I&#39;m like this is how I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.639" end="00:25:00.289" style="s2">leadership to feel and but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.580" end="00:25:02.239" style="s2">eventually got there with all of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.289" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know there&#39;s more crucible</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.239" end="00:25:06.070" style="s2">moments but whatever like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:11.920" style="s2">probably enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.070" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.920" end="00:25:16.550" style="s2">and that leads nicely into something</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.410" style="s2">that Jennifer I know you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.550" end="00:25:21.080" style="s2">passionate about which is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.410" end="00:25:22.280" style="s2">interconnectedness between all of us and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.080" end="00:25:24.470" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear more about the work</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:26.420" style="s2">that you do with Brian and with couples</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.470" end="00:25:28.040" style="s2">to think about the future of love in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.420" end="00:25:29.420" style="s2">future of partnership and now that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.040" end="00:25:31.280" style="s2">bleeds into your work with communities</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.420" end="00:25:33.620" style="s2">like Kent mystic at Burning Man and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.280" end="00:25:36.200" style="s2">teens and leadership and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.620" end="00:25:38.450" style="s2">future of communities in general so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.200" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">can speak of it and of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.450" end="00:25:42.860" style="s2">connection level and then what you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:44.210" style="s2">as the future of partnership and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.860" end="00:25:49.490" style="s2">community and what your vision is for</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.210" end="00:25:52.250" style="s2">that it&#39;s a big question um so I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.490" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">really struck inspired really by a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.250" end="00:26:00.050" style="s2">community that lives in Tamara and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:01.820" style="s2">hearing this phrase really really like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.050" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">it was a hot tub rich felling me in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.820" end="00:26:08.330" style="s2">moment which is that we cannot live in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">world without war until we heal the war</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.330" end="00:26:14.510" style="s2">between the sexes so if we take that on</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">for a moment where we take the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.510" end="00:26:19.640" style="s2">love which we think of as the personal</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:21.740" style="s2">the individual like how do I get more</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.640" end="00:26:23.540" style="s2">love in my life and sex and affection</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:25.370" style="s2">and safety all of those are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.540" end="00:26:28.310" style="s2">important things but if we realize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.370" end="00:26:32.540" style="s2">love is also political right at a larger</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.310" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">scale because what happens is if we live</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.540" end="00:26:37.910" style="s2">in a world where we are at war with</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:40.490" style="s2">ourselves which is the majority of us we</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.910" end="00:26:42.470" style="s2">are divided the masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.490" end="00:26:44.300" style="s2">in us with its different poles its</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.470" end="00:26:47.570" style="s2">different desires its different value</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.300" end="00:26:49.730" style="s2">sets are at war inside of us we live in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.570" end="00:26:52.070" style="s2">a holographic universe it&#39;s my belief we</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.730" end="00:26:55.490" style="s2">mirror it we holographic a tree</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.070" end="00:26:57.470" style="s2">represent that systemically so then I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.490" end="00:26:59.240" style="s2">at war inside myself then I&#39;m at war</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.470" end="00:27:01.670" style="s2">with my partner and I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.240" end="00:27:03.580" style="s2">conflict and then and then I recreate</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.670" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">those kind of warring systems in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.580" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">economic policies and then I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:09.450" style="s2">create that in my political systems and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">then there at war and then I recreate</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:14.580" style="s2">that in my culture because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">connected I mean we&#39;re going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.580" end="00:27:19.889" style="s2">lot and we&#39;re already talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:24.029" style="s2">systems understanding of this reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.889" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">and so when I started to go into like</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.029" end="00:27:27.750" style="s2">what can I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:30.450" style="s2">what&#39;s the trim tab to use like a buck</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.750" end="00:27:32.460" style="s2">Mr Fuller term term and a trim tab is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:36.330" style="s2">kind of like a fancy way of saying like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.460" end="00:27:39.149" style="s2">what is the the the leverage point that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.330" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">if you push in a small with a small</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.149" end="00:27:45.149" style="s2">amount of effort here it yields an</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:46.919" style="s2">enormous result on the other side when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.149" end="00:27:48.600" style="s2">when I dived into that question because</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.919" end="00:27:50.639" style="s2">I did want to leave the world better</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.600" end="00:27:52.470" style="s2">than I found it damn it right I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.639" end="00:27:55.769" style="s2">to do that as that precocious child was</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.470" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">living into this dream and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.769" end="00:28:02.010" style="s2">that one of the things that all of us in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">this room can do you know you all have</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.010" end="00:28:05.820" style="s2">your in unique ways that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:08.279" style="s2">give your gifts to the world to really</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.820" end="00:28:10.350" style="s2">shape it into the future but there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.279" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">thing we can all do which is heal the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.350" end="00:28:16.529" style="s2">war inside ourselves right which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:19.080" style="s2">evolve the way that we love right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.529" end="00:28:21.149" style="s2">when we do that it&#39;s my belief like how</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.080" end="00:28:23.940" style="s2">does that relate to the future it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.149" end="00:28:28.889" style="s2">belief that all of our bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.940" end="00:28:31.320" style="s2">decision-making is sourced from fear and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.889" end="00:28:34.110" style="s2">when we&#39;re driven by separation and</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.390" end="00:29:22.730" style="s2">differently which is that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.740" end="00:29:25.580" style="s2">culture shifters and I realized that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.730" end="00:29:29.000" style="s2">could be a culture shifter because to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.580" end="00:29:31.610" style="s2">interact with me was to feel someone who</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.000" end="00:29:34.100" style="s2">was more and more integrated who was</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.610" end="00:29:35.750" style="s2">more and more connected and who was more</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.100" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">and more expanded rather than more and</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">disintegrated and so my work in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.210" end="00:29:47.030" style="s2">world is to heal that divide and that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:49.910" style="s2">my trim tab it&#39;s one of the trim tabs</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.179" end="00:30:35.809" style="s2">until we realize the power of community</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.429" end="00:30:39.860" style="s2">of tribe to help create the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.809" end="00:30:42.390" style="s2">that creates transparency truth trust</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.860" end="00:30:44.520" style="s2">because that is what will shield the</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.850" end="00:36:10.750" style="s2">be curious for you to share a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.080" end="00:36:14.170" style="s2">your work with neuro hacker and for what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.750" end="00:36:16.030" style="s2">you see is the future of nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.170" end="00:36:17.410" style="s2">and different technologies that will</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.030" end="00:36:19.240" style="s2">interrelate with people in the human</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.410" end="00:36:21.330" style="s2">body and how we&#39;ll be able to enhance</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.240" end="00:36:25.980" style="s2">our systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.330" end="00:36:27.870" style="s2">over time what that will look like okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.980" end="00:36:32.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a very different direction me to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.870" end="00:36:34.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s something that ties just kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.940" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">of piggybacking on with Jennifer shirts</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.380" end="00:36:38.940" style="s2">and it ties it all together we can think</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:40.590" style="s2">of anything as a relationship or as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.940" end="00:36:42.660" style="s2">complex set of relationships of other</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.590" end="00:36:44.490" style="s2">things where the relationships actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.660" end="00:36:45.750" style="s2">add and that novelty we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.490" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">understanding the parts in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.750" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough right there&#39;s synergy</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">there&#39;s emergent behaviors of the holes</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:54.540" style="s2">you don&#39;t you don&#39;t predict just by the</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.540" end="00:36:57.780" style="s2">the name of this talk has to do a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.250" end="00:37:01.320" style="s2">visioning if you train the systems right</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.780" end="00:37:03.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a Systems Theory another way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.320" end="00:37:05.340" style="s2">saying it is that everything is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.750" end="00:37:07.950" style="s2">interrelationship of other things</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.340" end="00:37:09.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a synergistically aq8 actuated</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.950" end="00:37:11.970" style="s2">emergent property of other things</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.970" end="00:37:16.140" style="s2">has this really beautiful way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.730" style="s2">it resists do you think of a molecule as</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.140" end="00:37:19.950" style="s2">a complex relationship between the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.730" end="00:37:21.480" style="s2">that make it up and then that between</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.950" end="00:37:23.730" style="s2">the fundamental particles that make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.480" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">up and you can keep going to where there</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.730" end="00:37:28.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t actually a fundamental atomistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:29.910" style="s2">thing that we can think of universe as</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.830" end="00:37:32.250" style="s2">an inner relationship of</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.580" end="00:37:51.840" style="s2">it universe Tom spoke to that right he</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.040" end="00:37:53.700" style="s2">spoke to the he&#39;s actually eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.840" end="00:37:55.230" style="s2">or ten other people and even if it</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.700" end="00:37:57.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for the blood transfusion he</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.230" end="00:37:58.680" style="s2">talks about how his breath and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.000" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2">everything else makes him other people</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.680" end="00:38:02.700" style="s2">and not yet was there millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.210" end="00:38:04.860" style="s2">all the time yeah yeah keep going and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.700" end="00:38:06.420" style="s2">not just his body but his thoughts came</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.860" end="00:38:09.660" style="s2">from other people his language right</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.420" end="00:38:11.160" style="s2">Jennifer is talking about this in actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.660" end="00:38:15.350" style="s2">human relationships but we can really</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.160" end="00:38:18.200" style="s2">think of we can think of economics as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.350" end="00:38:19.370" style="s2">process of mediating relationships</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.200" end="00:38:21.620" style="s2">and you can have macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.370" end="00:38:24.020" style="s2">structures that do that better and worse</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.620" end="00:38:27.610" style="s2">in terms of certain properties we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.020" end="00:38:30.260" style="s2">you think of everything that way and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.610" end="00:38:32.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of taken it I&#39;ve taken the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.260" end="00:38:34.340" style="s2">kind of complex systems whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.150" end="00:38:36.290" style="s2">approach to problems that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.340" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">adequate solutions that I cared about in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.290" end="00:38:40.460" style="s2">different areas like social systems and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">environments and medicine because when</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.460" end="00:38:44.330" style="s2">you have very complex systems we have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.790" style="s2">lot of interacting parts and complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.330" end="00:38:48.950" style="s2">causal models then understanding one</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.790" end="00:38:50.420" style="s2">Parden kind of changing that doesn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:53.270" style="s2">up being adequate most of the time like</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.420" end="00:38:56.450" style="s2">Tom&#39;s story about some motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.270" end="00:38:58.790" style="s2">that health crucible I also had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.450" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">diagnosis of incurable autoimmune or a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.790" end="00:39:02.330" style="s2">degenerative illness and it was both</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:04.460" style="s2">incurable in the allopathic space in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.330" end="00:39:06.980" style="s2">the integrative medicine space and so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.460" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">was like cool the only we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.980" end="00:39:11.660" style="s2">this one out is to actually really model</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:14.090" style="s2">what&#39;s happening which tissues are being</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.660" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">damaged by which chemicals what Cascades</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.090" end="00:39:17.870" style="s2">could cause those and it required one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.520" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">the things that I found was I was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.870" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">alright for these diseases there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:24.170" style="s2">statistical correlation of this disease</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:24.920" style="s2">was with this possible cause but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.170" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.920" end="00:39:28.250" style="s2">someone for what right but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:29.630" style="s2">some statistical correlation with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.250" end="00:39:31.550" style="s2">cause in this cause and that was true</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.630" end="00:39:34.070" style="s2">over several thousand distinct causes</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.550" end="00:39:35.630" style="s2">some toxins and genetics of nutritional</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.070" end="00:39:38.270" style="s2">deficiencies and pathogens and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.630" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">structural issues and so petty say</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.270" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">alright well maybe a disease like MS or</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:44.990" style="s2">like ALS or it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:46.760" style="s2">set of symptoms that can have many</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.990" end="00:39:48.530" style="s2">different causal pathways that come in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.760" end="00:39:50.540" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not even the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.530" end="00:39:53.090" style="s2">in any two people right maybe it is a a</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.540" end="00:39:55.730" style="s2">kind of causal cascade that some number</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.090" end="00:39:57.650" style="s2">of things can trigger and so I started</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.730" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">kind of looking at how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.650" end="00:40:02.660" style="s2">inventory how do we ontology is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:04.280" style="s2">space and then do the differential</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.660" end="00:40:06.200" style="s2">diagnosis to see which of those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.280" end="00:40:08.500" style="s2">are happening and how to reverse it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.200" end="00:40:11.030" style="s2">that rabbit hole ended up leading to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.500" end="00:40:13.130" style="s2">very fortunately me figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.030" end="00:40:15.290" style="s2">reverse those illnesses and myself and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.130" end="00:40:16.920" style="s2">then in the process of course everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.290" end="00:40:18.840" style="s2">who&#39;s around me that also had in her</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.920" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">we went through those and that was in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.840" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">autoimmunity and nerdy genin cancers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:26.370" style="s2">specifically chronic complex disease not</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.590" style="s2">acute disease for which allopathic</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.370" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">medicine is usually fairly good because</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.590" end="00:40:36.020" style="s2">it&#39;s got kind of specific causation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:39.390" style="s2">so then that led to really diving into</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.020" end="00:40:44.970" style="s2">are there fundamentally better solutions</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.390" end="00:40:46.920" style="s2">for all disease and illness and is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.970" end="00:40:48.990" style="s2">likely that they are not the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.920" end="00:40:50.610" style="s2">solution for different people so really</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.990" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">diving into personalized medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.610" end="00:40:55.950" style="s2">that&#39;s not just in psycho neuro space</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:58.620" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of focusing in psycho neuro</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.950" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">to begin with because we&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.620" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">insights that we can work with there but</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:05.130" style="s2">then that expands to Narada Genesis to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">medicine and then human wellness kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">holistically and then beyond human</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:11.880" style="s2">wellness right social systems and is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:14.510" style="s2">same model applied at scale but so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.880" end="00:41:17.070" style="s2">started to look at for any particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.510" end="00:41:18.930" style="s2">pathology what are all of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.070" end="00:41:21.810" style="s2">causes that could bring that about</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.930" end="00:41:23.340" style="s2">how do we identify what the specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.810" end="00:41:26.220" style="s2">combinatoric of potentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.340" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">n-dimensional partial causes are and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.220" end="00:41:30.060" style="s2">then how do we identify specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:32.030" style="s2">therapeutic protocols you think about a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.060" end="00:41:34.950" style="s2">clinical trial is one intervention</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.030" end="00:41:36.300" style="s2">across a whole range of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.950" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to see do we have some</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:41.070" style="s2">statistical significance beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:42.900" style="s2">placebo but if I want to do personalized</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.070" end="00:41:45.660" style="s2">medicine I&#39;m looking at your genome your</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.900" end="00:41:47.430" style="s2">metabolomic chemistry your causes I need</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.660" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">to optimize for N equals one we need</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.790" end="00:41:57.530" style="s2">things that that led to is we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.990" end="00:42:00.210" style="s2">neural technology company that is</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:04.650" style="s2">of any kinds and you see again you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.650" end="00:43:07.710" style="s2">it yourself and then think about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.790" end="00:43:08.760" style="s2">scale at which it happens these are some</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.710" end="00:43:12.210" style="s2">of the great issues we want to address</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.760" end="00:43:13.980" style="s2">right but not just human suffering for</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.980" end="00:43:16.890" style="s2">better but when you start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.329" end="00:43:18.510" style="s2">that most of the things we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.890" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">change in the world actually involve</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.510" end="00:43:22.440" style="s2">changing human behavior that&#39;s causing</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.210" end="00:43:38.600" style="s2">influences there are social structure</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:41.030" style="s2">influences we have to address all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.600" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">those so that biology piece is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.030" end="00:43:44.930" style="s2">but not sufficient for addressing some</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">of the elements that condition human</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.930" end="00:43:50.420" style="s2">behavior but the idea of can we actually</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.420" end="00:43:54.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s a big deal if we can and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.090" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">the answer again surprisingly ends up</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.980" end="00:43:58.790" style="s2">being out there&#39;s a lot that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:44:03.320" style="s2">about that to then imagine a world in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.790" end="00:44:05.030" style="s2">which everyone&#39;s bio bio physiology is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.320" end="00:44:07.730" style="s2">predisposed for very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.030" end="00:44:10.610" style="s2">empathy for a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.730" end="00:44:12.320" style="s2">emotional intelligence or can cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.610" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">capacity to sync with nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.320" end="00:44:17.210" style="s2">complex complexity then of course you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:19.150" style="s2">have to actually have the software set</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.210" end="00:44:23.210" style="s2">you have to have training and education</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.150" end="00:44:24.470" style="s2">animatics but you have to process those</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.210" end="00:44:29.240" style="s2">things so that&#39;s why we&#39;re addressing</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.470" end="00:44:30.650" style="s2">this you know particularly thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.240" end="00:44:32.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a few friends who&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.650" end="00:44:35.150" style="s2">qualia which is their first product and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.780" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">I these are friends I&#39;ve known for years</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.150" end="00:44:40.100" style="s2">and seeing them after taking it for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.130" end="00:44:43.430" style="s2">week I&#39;m saying you&#39;re more grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.100" end="00:44:45.080" style="s2">present and happy and empathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.430" end="00:44:46.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever seen you what happened I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.080" end="00:44:49.820" style="s2">oh I tried qualia do you notice the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.370" end="00:44:51.350" style="s2">difference so it&#39;s a bit like that movie</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.820" end="00:44:53.960" style="s2">limitless have you all seen the movie</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.350" end="00:44:57.050" style="s2">limitless so if you haven&#39;t tried it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.960" end="00:44:57.910" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredible experience I am I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.050" end="00:45:00.740" style="s2">love it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.910" end="00:45:02.390" style="s2">so don&#39;t tell anybody outside of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.740" end="00:45:07.460" style="s2">room but this is there&#39;s a Trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">actually right we wanted to see they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.460" end="00:45:10.610" style="s2">not that many people searching how do I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.460" style="s2">increase my empathy online but there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.610" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">a lot of people looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.460" end="00:45:17.510" style="s2">competitive advantage and we see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:18.470" style="s2">kind of red bull off-label adderall etc</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.510" end="00:45:19.550" style="s2">markets and we want</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.470" end="00:45:21.859" style="s2">see what can we enhance people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.550" end="00:45:24.590" style="s2">Cottenham capability in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.859" end="00:45:26.270" style="s2">provides immediate noticeable benefit so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.590" end="00:45:27.800" style="s2">instead of using off-label adderall they</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.270" end="00:45:29.540" style="s2">could use this that doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.800" end="00:45:31.369" style="s2">side effects that actually has long-term</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.540" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">positives these every one of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.369" end="00:45:37.910" style="s2">criteria adding to how hard this is and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.210" end="00:45:39.290" style="s2">that in addition to improving cognitum</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.910" end="00:45:40.700" style="s2">proved psycho-emotional metrics but we</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.290" end="00:45:42.020" style="s2">don&#39;t even have to talk about that right</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.700" end="00:45:46.700" style="s2">they could just be like a cool side</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.020" end="00:45:48.080" style="s2">effect and we started with bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.700" end="00:45:50.510" style="s2">product into market before some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.080" end="00:45:52.130" style="s2">other ones because it ends up being the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.510" end="00:45:55.570" style="s2">regulatory processes and the spacer</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.130" end="00:45:55.570" style="s2">comfortable complex itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.580" end="00:46:04.600" style="s2">yeah so I think Tom maybe I&#39;ll turn it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.970" end="00:46:07.250" style="s2">over to you now and I would be curious</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.600" end="00:46:09.860" style="s2">Daniel was just talking about individual</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.250" end="00:46:11.720" style="s2">human physiology and I&#39;m curious you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.860" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">thought a lot about as everyone on this</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.720" end="00:46:17.020" style="s2">panel has about different systems and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:20.570" style="s2">structures and kind of the future of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.020" end="00:46:23.840" style="s2">entrepreneurship and business and how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.570" end="00:46:24.530" style="s2">can transform business to transform the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.840" end="00:46:26.810" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.530" end="00:46:28.220" style="s2">can you speak a bit to your vision so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.810" end="00:46:30.110" style="s2">she was like super cool is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.220" end="00:46:31.370" style="s2">everybody came to the same conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.110" end="00:46:34.220" style="s2">but like a totally different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.370" end="00:46:36.260" style="s2">check this out so I went into the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.220" end="00:46:38.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay well I&#39;m good at</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.260" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">inventing stuff so I just like 75</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:41.750" style="s2">patents I&#39;ve invented maybe 10 times</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:43.340" style="s2">more stuff than iPad it did pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.750" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">inventing stuff and it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.340" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">fast and inventing stuff too I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:48.740" style="s2">good at teaching people how to go do</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:50.270" style="s2">those things so that&#39;s all good so my</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.740" end="00:46:51.620" style="s2">first thought was like let me just go</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.270" end="00:46:53.000" style="s2">out in the world and I&#39;ll like working</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.620" end="00:46:54.350" style="s2">these villages and I&#39;ll work with these</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.000" end="00:46:54.890" style="s2">people in government don&#39;t work with</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.350" end="00:46:56.930" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.890" end="00:46:58.460" style="s2">there are executives like we&#39;ll teach</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.930" end="00:47:00.950" style="s2">him how to go solve these problems real</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.460" end="00:47:02.390" style="s2">fast and I would totally go in there and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:03.710" style="s2">I would totally teach them to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.390" end="00:47:05.810" style="s2">when I was like sitting right next to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:07.370" style="s2">them they&#39;d be solving the problems 10</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.810" end="00:47:09.710" style="s2">times faster a hundred times faster</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.370" end="00:47:12.470" style="s2">maybe like this is freaking fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.710" end="00:47:14.990" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing and all this stuff was</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:17.090" style="s2">happening but then when I would leave</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.990" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">then little by little they would like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.090" end="00:47:22.010" style="s2">turn back to normal and I was like what</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:24.770" style="s2">is this about right here it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.010" end="00:47:26.600" style="s2">like we know how to do it it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.770" end="00:47:28.700" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even know it&#39;s not that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.600" end="00:47:31.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do or that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.700" end="00:47:34.230" style="s2">way to do it it&#39;s like even if I go to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.430" end="00:47:37.080" style="s2">you and show you how to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.230" end="00:47:40.230" style="s2">you want to do you don&#39;t do it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.080" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">really weird and I started to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.230" end="00:47:45.540" style="s2">that like there&#39;s these outer challenges</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:48.090" style="s2">which are yes poverty and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.540" end="00:47:49.830" style="s2">access to clean water and economic</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.090" end="00:47:52.250" style="s2">inequality and just I can go on and on</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.830" end="00:47:54.600" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bunch of them that matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.250" end="00:47:56.220" style="s2">and a bunch of I&#39;m working on it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.600" end="00:47:58.109" style="s2">there&#39;s pull me aside if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.220" end="00:48:00.300" style="s2">talk about it ourselves but actually the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.109" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">main problem is the inner stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.300" end="00:48:04.440" style="s2">basically there&#39;s a realization that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:06.750" style="s2">have the world that we do because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.440" end="00:48:09.240" style="s2">think the way that we do right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.750" end="00:48:11.220" style="s2">unless we fix it in here then it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.240" end="00:48:13.080" style="s2">going to get fixed out there so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.220" end="00:48:15.810" style="s2">this is a great example so I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.080" end="00:48:17.400" style="s2">guatemalan cloud forest with my friend</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.810" end="00:48:19.170" style="s2">Juan who&#39;s driving a pickup truck and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.400" end="00:48:20.700" style="s2">we&#39;re bouncing around trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.170" end="00:48:23.220" style="s2">this remote village to get them solar</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.700" end="00:48:24.900" style="s2">power for the first time ever cool but</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.220" end="00:48:26.609" style="s2">because of that we have like all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.900" end="00:48:29.070" style="s2">hours in the jungle because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.609" end="00:48:30.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no roads like this is you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.070" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">like four miles per hour or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.750" end="00:48:33.750" style="s2">even though you&#39;re in a truck takes</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:35.100" style="s2">freaky forever to get anywhere so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.750" end="00:48:37.500" style="s2">have like four or five hours in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.100" end="00:48:40.290" style="s2">truck and sometimes during that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.500" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">trip he&#39;s like Tom you know maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.290" end="00:48:44.040" style="s2">too late to create a sustainable planet</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:46.200" style="s2">maybe maybe if we only had us half as</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.040" end="00:48:47.970" style="s2">many people you know population wise did</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.200" end="00:48:49.290" style="s2">so many I mean it&#39;s not I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.970" end="00:48:51.090" style="s2">like kill everybody&#39;s like imagine like</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.290" end="00:48:52.380" style="s2">if the world only had half as many</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.090" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">people like maybe we could make a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.380" end="00:48:56.430" style="s2">sustainable planet then and like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:57.900" style="s2">just came out of nowhere I would like</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.430" end="00:49:01.050" style="s2">was not even thinking but as soon as he</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.900" end="00:49:03.330" style="s2">said that was like 1 we had half as many</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.050" end="00:49:05.220" style="s2">people in the world 40 years ago and if</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.330" end="00:49:07.830" style="s2">we keep thinking the way that we do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.220" end="00:49:09.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter we could have half as</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.830" end="00:49:11.180" style="s2">many people today and we would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.450" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">exactly the same problems in 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.180" end="00:49:16.530" style="s2">problems not out there it&#39;s in here and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:18.600" style="s2">what you guys just said is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:21.829" style="s2">there&#39;s just you&#39;re coming from like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.600" end="00:49:24.950" style="s2">okay well how do we inspire epithelia</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.829" end="00:49:27.319" style="s2">you know you know different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.950" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">how do we heal relationships from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.319" end="00:49:30.950" style="s2">inside out starting with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:32.359" style="s2">relationship with yourself and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.950" end="00:49:34.309" style="s2">basically trying to work on the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.359" end="00:49:35.559" style="s2">thing I call it the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.309" end="00:49:38.539" style="s2">antecedents to global prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.559" end="00:49:40.099" style="s2">whatever I&#39;m not a marketing person but</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.539" end="00:49:40.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a very accurate term for what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.099" end="00:49:42.469" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.940" end="00:49:44.420" style="s2">can you pick that the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.469" end="00:49:46.549" style="s2">antecedents of global prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.420" end="00:49:48.019" style="s2">how would you need to think in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.549" end="00:49:51.589" style="s2">have an awesome world that&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.019" end="00:49:53.329" style="s2">to say it but like my approach to it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.589" end="00:49:55.039" style="s2">like different than these two other</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.329" end="00:49:58.130" style="s2">approaches where my approach is like</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.039" end="00:50:00.890" style="s2">well let me figure out these like really</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.130" end="00:50:02.779" style="s2">interesting ways to teach that like</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.890" end="00:50:05.059" style="s2">stick with people that challenge I</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.779" end="00:50:07.969" style="s2">consider it most like more like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.059" end="00:50:10.339" style="s2">bugs in the operating system of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.969" end="00:50:12.589" style="s2">collective consciousness and like me as</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.339" end="00:50:14.809" style="s2">like an engineer or programmer is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.589" end="00:50:17.239" style="s2">to debug it and the way that and will be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.809" end="00:50:18.920" style="s2">dot B is that debug is not by</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.239" end="00:50:21.229" style="s2">overwriting lines of code in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.920" end="00:50:23.779" style="s2">but like inserting like these little</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.229" end="00:50:25.430" style="s2">procedures they&#39;re like Zen cones but</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.779" end="00:50:27.499" style="s2">keep on unpacking themselves forever</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.430" end="00:50:30.920" style="s2">inside of your brain until you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.499" end="00:50:32.809" style="s2">holy crap so I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.920" end="00:50:34.249" style="s2">share a couple super quickly but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.809" end="00:50:35.900" style="s2">not even the vision that like I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.249" end="00:50:38.509" style="s2">Nadia&#39;s asked ago so I&#39;ll do that super</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.900" end="00:50:41.329" style="s2">quickly because that&#39;s not the point so</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.509" end="00:50:43.999" style="s2">check it out so one of them is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.329" end="00:50:45.709" style="s2">knowing as the enemy of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.999" end="00:50:47.449" style="s2">people are like oh wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.709" end="00:50:49.219" style="s2">knowingly oh they are kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.449" end="00:50:51.859" style="s2">oh yeah and actually when I&#39;m in a state</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.219" end="00:50:53.650" style="s2">of knowing and actually I have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.859" end="00:50:55.999" style="s2">talk about it but basically it says that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.650" end="00:50:58.039" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a state of no way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.999" end="00:50:59.479" style="s2">literally impossible to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.039" end="00:51:01.249" style="s2">anything that you actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.479" end="00:51:03.349" style="s2">improve or change you need to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.249" end="00:51:05.150" style="s2">state of learning about and I see people</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.349" end="00:51:07.190" style="s2">constantly in a state of knowing in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.150" end="00:51:09.890" style="s2">what we do on TV is we bring experts</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.190" end="00:51:12.529" style="s2">onboard and experts are constantly in</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.890" end="00:51:13.880" style="s2">the state of knowing right if you ever</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.529" end="00:51:15.289" style="s2">wanted anything to be different about</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.880" end="00:51:17.630" style="s2">the world do not bring a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.289" end="00:51:19.969" style="s2">experts to share their opinions not</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.630" end="00:51:21.829" style="s2">because expertise is not useful but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.969" end="00:51:24.759" style="s2">using your mind in a state of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.829" end="00:51:26.820" style="s2">which is what experts are asked to do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.759" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">very toxic to change</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.820" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">anything go ahead and bring those same</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">experts but get them into a state of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:33.720" style="s2">learning say here&#39;s the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to solve together roll up</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.720" end="00:51:37.650" style="s2">your sleeves were solving right don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.090" style="s2">ask for their opinions about things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.650" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">will move everybody into a state of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.090" end="00:51:45.180" style="s2">knowing another simple one is we built</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">an entire society built off of the debug</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.180" end="00:51:50.580" style="s2">that net worth equals human worth right</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.620" style="s2">like nobody gets on the map when does</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.580" end="00:51:54.360" style="s2">the actor or actress get on the magazine</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.620" end="00:51:56.520" style="s2">cover when they have the movie where</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.360" end="00:51:59.100" style="s2">they make twenty million dollars were</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.520" end="00:52:02.130" style="s2">they a much worse actor or actress six</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.100" end="00:52:04.080" style="s2">months prior no they were just as</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.130" end="00:52:05.970" style="s2">interesting just as compelling just as</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.080" end="00:52:08.010" style="s2">amazing as people and at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.970" end="00:52:09.660" style="s2">their net worth changes we think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.010" end="00:52:11.790" style="s2">their human worth changes we do not</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.660" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">question this very often every single</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.790" end="00:52:15.060" style="s2">thing that you&#39;ve seen in the media</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:17.070" style="s2">every single thing like why you talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.060" end="00:52:19.170" style="s2">about some people not other people is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.070" end="00:52:20.250" style="s2">exactly built off of this belief and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.170" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">more that you pay attention to us</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.250" end="00:52:24.870" style="s2">believe the more that you understand is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:26.520" style="s2">completely untrue right and the more</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.870" end="00:52:27.930" style="s2">that you understand it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.520" end="00:52:29.550" style="s2">then the more that you&#39;ll construct a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.930" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">life based on the stuff that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.550" end="00:52:33.390" style="s2">true everybody actually matters and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interesting stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.390" end="00:52:37.410" style="s2">everybody and that there&#39;s a type of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.880" end="00:52:39.270" style="s2">worth that you will receive from</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.410" end="00:52:40.950" style="s2">everybody if you can just hear them</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.270" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s not the important stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.950" end="00:52:46.350" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get okay but visions there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:47.880" style="s2">all this stuff so yes so I had this</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.350" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">whole thing where I like wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.880" end="00:52:50.670" style="s2">corporate executive because my whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:52.890" style="s2">thought was like I&#39;d be a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.670" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">executive via top executive a fortune</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.890" end="00:52:57.450" style="s2">500 company and I&#39;ll push him over to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:59.730" style="s2">100% sustainable and that will be like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.450" end="00:53:01.620" style="s2">really good mark but then like at some</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.730" end="00:53:03.750" style="s2">point like when I left my executive job</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.620" end="00:53:06.750" style="s2">I was like in the jungles in Hawaii and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.750" end="00:53:07.890" style="s2">I was like huh how good was my goal so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.750" end="00:53:09.150" style="s2">like whipped out it thinks I have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.890" end="00:53:12.420" style="s2">spreadsheet in the jungles of Hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.150" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">that&#39;s me so then I like started</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.420" end="00:53:15.780" style="s2">calculating the thing and I&#39;m like what</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:19.050" style="s2">if I got that goal a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.780" end="00:53:20.760" style="s2">right what if I became the CEO not just</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.050" end="00:53:22.590" style="s2">any executive the top executive with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.760" end="00:53:23.610" style="s2">largest organization in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.590" end="00:53:25.509" style="s2">made it a hundred percent sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.610" end="00:53:27.759" style="s2">what percentage the global economy</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.759" end="00:53:31.389" style="s2">point in time the largest corporation in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.139" end="00:53:32.889" style="s2">the world&#39;s Walmart and I calculated</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.389" end="00:53:34.749" style="s2">exactly what percentage the global</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.889" end="00:53:37.630" style="s2">economy like Walmart directly impacts</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.749" end="00:53:41.709" style="s2">and so imagine that&#39;s how much you could</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.630" end="00:53:43.269" style="s2">make sustainable the answer is 0.4% and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.709" end="00:53:45.609" style="s2">I was like I picked the wrong goal I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.269" end="00:53:48.399" style="s2">an idiot and I was like this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.609" end="00:53:50.679" style="s2">completely ludicrous we need an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.399" end="00:53:53.619" style="s2">different framework for this so long</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.679" end="00:53:55.089" style="s2">story short I like dug in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.619" end="00:53:57.939" style="s2">spreadsheets and like did a gajillion</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.089" end="00:53:59.979" style="s2">calculations for for two days and at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.939" end="00:54:02.439" style="s2">end of it I realized that there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.979" end="00:54:04.899" style="s2">only like 17 industries that make up 95%</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.439" end="00:54:07.239" style="s2">in the global economy there&#39;s only four</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.899" end="00:54:08.949" style="s2">possible outcomes from them relative to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.239" end="00:54:11.259" style="s2">a sustainable future they either need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.949" end="00:54:13.689" style="s2">grow quickly die quickly grow slowly or</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.259" end="00:54:15.219" style="s2">die slowly right and you can just mark</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.689" end="00:54:17.319" style="s2">the industry and say this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.219" end="00:54:19.059" style="s2">gonna happen to you in the next 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.319" end="00:54:21.909" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna have a sustainable planet</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.059" end="00:54:23.079" style="s2">but not only did I get there I was like</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.909" end="00:54:24.729" style="s2">holy crap</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.079" end="00:54:26.169" style="s2">maybe that may not be enough because</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.729" end="00:54:27.429" style="s2">actually when you go into the stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.169" end="00:54:29.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a very long discussion of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.429" end="00:54:31.289" style="s2">way that may not be enough but there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.709" end="00:54:33.880" style="s2">a further realization where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.289" end="00:54:35.979" style="s2">that should not be the goal the goal</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.880" end="00:54:37.779" style="s2">should be the following the goal is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.979" end="00:54:40.449" style="s2">humanity needs to become a net positive</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.779" end="00:54:51.789" style="s2">to nature there&#39;s no other situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.449" end="00:54:53.289" style="s2">where we survive like like our best</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.789" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">plans are like let&#39;s it up a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.289" end="00:54:58.839" style="s2">bit slower but then it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:55:00.969" style="s2">you don&#39;t like destroy the planet in 50</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.839" end="00:55:03.939" style="s2">years you just try it in 150 years nice</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.969" end="00:55:05.439" style="s2">job right or we think Willis how about</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.939" end="00:55:06.639" style="s2">sustainable sustainable is pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.439" end="00:55:08.229" style="s2">but here&#39;s the difficulty about</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.639" end="00:55:09.909" style="s2">sustainable especially when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.229" end="00:55:11.979" style="s2">the economic frame things are</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.909" end="00:55:15.489" style="s2">sustainable they tend to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.979" end="00:55:17.199" style="s2">careful connection of what is works in</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.489" end="00:55:19.089" style="s2">with the environment that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.199" end="00:55:20.769" style="s2">environmental sustainability what works</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.089" end="00:55:22.719" style="s2">with the market and what works with</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.769" end="00:55:24.759" style="s2">current technology the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.719" end="00:55:27.069" style="s2">is technology in the market are</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.759" end="00:55:29.019" style="s2">constantly changing so like even if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.069" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">made a company that was doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.019" end="00:55:32.549" style="s2">totally sustainably right now you fast</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:34.619" style="s2">forward 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.549" end="00:55:36.599" style="s2">technology market is super different and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.619" end="00:55:38.549" style="s2">your things broken and every single time</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.599" end="00:55:40.140" style="s2">that it&#39;s broken even by a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.549" end="00:55:42.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a lag period where you&#39;re not fully</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.140" end="00:55:44.699" style="s2">sustainable so even sustainable is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.839" end="00:55:46.619" style="s2">sustainable because sustainable as</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.699" end="00:55:48.959" style="s2">defined right now has a type of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.619" end="00:55:51.779" style="s2">fragility to it the net output of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.959" end="00:55:53.429" style="s2">humanity needs to be more people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.779" end="00:55:55.229" style="s2">there are we need to add more topsoil</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.429" end="00:55:57.179" style="s2">per year the more people that there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.229" end="00:55:59.069" style="s2">then we need to have cleaner water and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.179" end="00:56:01.049" style="s2">cleaner air every single year</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.069" end="00:56:03.929" style="s2">the more people that there are the more</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.049" end="00:56:05.759" style="s2">that we need to like encourage the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.929" end="00:56:07.619" style="s2">return of species biodiversity and all</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.759" end="00:56:09.569" style="s2">the environments that we have any care</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.619" end="00:56:13.289" style="s2">over which at this point is the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.569" end="00:56:26.609" style="s2">birth so that&#39;s kind of what&#39;s up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.289" end="00:56:27.749" style="s2">enough we&#39;re good say because we worked</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.609" end="00:56:30.209" style="s2">to get a little bit on the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.749" end="00:56:31.890" style="s2">project and what I love about what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.209" end="00:56:34.709" style="s2">are saying tom is is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.890" end="00:56:36.569" style="s2">feel like we never question which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.709" end="00:56:39.509" style="s2">that like the very purpose of our</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.569" end="00:56:41.609" style="s2">projects the very purpose of our</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.509" end="00:56:44.819" style="s2">businesses the very purpose of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.609" end="00:56:47.339" style="s2">is to grow and consume and grow and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.819" end="00:56:48.809" style="s2">consume some more and grow and consume</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.339" end="00:56:50.900" style="s2">some more which is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.809" end="00:56:53.459" style="s2">appropriate in an adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.900" end="00:56:56.519" style="s2">prepubescent early developmental stage</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.459" end="00:56:58.499" style="s2">like if you look at a biological kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.519" end="00:57:00.929" style="s2">organism there is a time when you are</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.499" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">growing from like a single cell to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.929" end="00:57:05.009" style="s2">trillions and you need to grow and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.739" style="s2">consume in order to develop into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.009" end="00:57:10.199" style="s2">adult phase and just what I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.739" end="00:57:12.839" style="s2">and what you said and something I want</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.199" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">us to look at for a moment is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.839" end="00:57:18.179" style="s2">developmental phase is just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.670" style="s2">developmental one and yet we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.179" end="00:57:22.469" style="s2">arrested ourselves in this phase what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.670" end="00:57:24.539" style="s2">think the purpose of our business is to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.469" end="00:57:26.670" style="s2">grow every year and extract more and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.539" end="00:57:28.380" style="s2">more profit I mean how many of you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.670" end="00:57:31.019" style="s2">ever questioned whether the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.380" end="00:57:33.089" style="s2">your business each year upon year could</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.019" end="00:57:33.740" style="s2">be maybe not how do I make it bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.089" end="00:57:36.980" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.740" end="00:57:38.330" style="s2">at work like that&#39;s not something most</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.980" end="00:57:41.480" style="s2">of us thank God there&#39;s a few of you</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.330" end="00:57:43.010" style="s2">it&#39;s great but what would I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.480" end="00:57:45.619" style="s2">you know something that Dan and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.010" end="00:57:48.680" style="s2">a lot about when we work together was</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.619" end="00:57:51.140" style="s2">the need for us to transition out of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.680" end="00:57:54.590" style="s2">growth consumption mindset because we</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.140" end="00:57:57.350" style="s2">have we&#39;ve done that we&#39;re here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.590" end="00:57:59.360" style="s2">beyond that phase and there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.350" end="00:58:01.400" style="s2">a more mature phase to me which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.360" end="00:58:05.140" style="s2">marked by what he&#39;s saying which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.400" end="00:58:07.369" style="s2">marked by being regenerative adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.140" end="00:58:10.070" style="s2">Omni considerate to use one of my</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.369" end="00:58:13.390" style="s2">favorite words from Daniel right so</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.070" end="00:58:16.070" style="s2">imagine if every project every business</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.390" end="00:58:18.770" style="s2">everything that we approached had those</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.070" end="00:58:21.140" style="s2">primary principles that it is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.770" end="00:58:23.180" style="s2">regenerative and Omni considerate</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.140" end="00:58:26.150" style="s2">meaning in our systems thinking approach</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.180" end="00:58:28.940" style="s2">we consider the impact on all not just</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.150" end="00:58:31.940" style="s2">ourselves our bottom line not just on</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.940" end="00:58:35.090" style="s2">our company not just on our industry not</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.940" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">just in our city but on us being not</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.090" end="00:58:40.970" style="s2">just our own kind of people but citizens</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:43.190" style="s2">of planet Earth you know Barbara Marx</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.970" end="00:58:45.740" style="s2">Hubbard we have Patricia in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.190" end="00:58:48.710" style="s2">room and her sister is a dear friend and</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.740" end="00:58:51.470" style="s2">she talks a lot about us real like</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.710" end="00:58:53.480" style="s2">reimagining ourselves not as you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.470" end="00:58:55.550" style="s2">I&#39;m Jennifer and I&#39;m from Texas or I</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.480" end="00:58:59.109" style="s2">live in California but I&#39;m a citizen of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.550" end="00:59:02.810" style="s2">planet Earth and that if you just shift</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.109" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">into that mindset and you shift your</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.810" end="00:59:06.560" style="s2">thinking around how you organize your</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.640" end="00:59:09.690" style="s2">projects such that they are at their</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.560" end="00:59:12.120" style="s2">bases regenerative on me considering</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.690" end="00:59:14.010" style="s2">and adaptive then we&#39;re going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.120" end="00:59:16.080" style="s2">lot better off and so I just encourage</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.010" end="00:59:18.150" style="s2">that I mean I was inspired by what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.080" end="00:59:20.100" style="s2">said Tom and by you know work I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.150" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">the dam though so just wanted to add</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.100" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">that thank you to that perhaps specific</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:30.180" style="s2">examples of organizations or initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.740" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen that are working</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.180" end="00:59:34.170" style="s2">towards a different reality and what</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:40.610" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and what their vision is</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.170" end="00:59:44.030" style="s2">perhaps in macroeconomics sir yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.610" end="00:59:47.300" style="s2">coming back to the topic for a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.030" end="00:59:49.170" style="s2">interconnectedness and actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.300" end="00:59:50.970" style="s2">understanding our interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.170" end="00:59:52.920" style="s2">with each other with the planet with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:55.740" style="s2">topsoil with everything else just quick</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.920" end="00:59:58.650" style="s2">exercise think about yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.740" end="01:00:02.520" style="s2">think about who you would be without the</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.160" end="01:00:34.800" style="s2">and you realized that the idea of I the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.090" end="01:00:36.330" style="s2">way we usually think of I as a separate</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.800" end="01:00:40.170" style="s2">concept as a misnomer it&#39;s a wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.330" end="01:00:42.180" style="s2">concept because we like to typically</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.170" end="01:00:43.770" style="s2">think of me my consciousness associated</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.180" end="01:00:47.030" style="s2">with this body and maybe being kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.770" end="01:00:48.750" style="s2">on the inside of it and maybe kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.030" end="01:00:50.130" style="s2">traditional neuro scientific framework</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.750" end="01:00:51.960" style="s2">as maybe consciousness is an emergent</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.130" end="01:00:56.610" style="s2">property of brains or this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.960" end="01:00:58.320" style="s2">system but my sense of self daniel myths</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.610" end="01:01:00.090" style="s2">is actually an emergent property of this</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.090" end="01:01:05.400" style="s2">universe and yes maybe if a particular</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.400" end="01:01:11.790" style="s2">lost but also changes out here change</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.730" end="01:01:14.280" style="s2">sense of self right so when you get that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.790" end="01:01:16.170" style="s2">and you really kind of take deeply the</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.070" end="01:01:25.780" style="s2">home way of thinking so then the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.650" end="01:01:26.950" style="s2">separate interest and especially not</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.780" end="01:01:28.330" style="s2">just separate interest but even</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.950" end="01:01:30.730" style="s2">competitive interest the idea that I</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.350" end="01:01:42.690" style="s2">is pathological right in the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.640" end="01:01:46.690" style="s2">kind of sense when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.690" end="01:01:48.430" style="s2">burning witches because which meant that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.690" end="01:01:50.050" style="s2">they used herbs instead of just prayer</p>

<p begin="01:01:50.050" end="01:01:55.810" style="s2">the Dark Ages we we can think of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.330" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">now as a bit of social insanity of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.810" end="01:01:59.170" style="s2">of the whole group of people right that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:01.600" style="s2">there are a whole group of people that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.170" end="01:02:03.910" style="s2">bought into a concept that was not just</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.360" end="01:02:24.130" style="s2">we think of insanity psychosis says</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.970" end="01:02:26.080" style="s2">believing stuff that isn&#39;t true and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.130" end="01:02:27.160" style="s2">can pathological insanity is acting on</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.080" end="01:02:29.800" style="s2">that in ways that actually cause</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.800" end="01:02:37.900" style="s2">we&#39;ve got social ubiquitous insanity we</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.870" end="01:02:39.880" style="s2">have to address right so the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.900" end="01:02:41.560" style="s2">separate balance sheets at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.880" end="01:02:44.950" style="s2">the individual or corporation or a</p>

<p begin="01:02:46.900" end="01:02:51.250" style="s2">actually underneath so many of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:52.540" style="s2">problems great in relationship the idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.250" end="01:02:55.990" style="s2">that you can never win a fight with your</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.990" end="01:02:59.620" style="s2">you really factor all the extra maladies</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.730" end="01:03:02.170" style="s2">and cause and effect equations or the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.620" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">idea that our life can actually get</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.170" end="01:03:06.550" style="s2">better by winning a war which is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.480" end="01:03:08.110" style="s2">nonsense concept right so there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.550" end="01:03:09.100" style="s2">only one balance sheet that matters</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.110" end="01:03:11.530" style="s2">which is the balance sheet of all</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.100" end="01:03:12.460" style="s2">universe and to just kind of bring it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.530" end="01:03:14.050" style="s2">back from it and we can think of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.460" end="01:03:16.470" style="s2">balance sheet of this biosphere because</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.050" end="01:03:18.380" style="s2">we have very deep interaction you</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.470" end="01:03:21.420" style="s2">and so then we say well how do I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.380" end="01:03:23.250" style="s2">dedicate my life to evolving the balance</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.420" end="01:03:28.200" style="s2">sheet of this biosphere of the Commons</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.200" end="01:03:30.900" style="s2">think about Tom&#39;s question of it the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.400" end="01:03:34.770" style="s2">biggest companies in the world still</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.900" end="01:03:41.460" style="s2">represent the tiniest fraction of global</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.970" end="01:03:56.820" style="s2">vicinity of 70 trillion well think about</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.300" end="01:03:58.980" style="s2">if 70 trillion dollars trade hands every</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.820" end="01:04:03.060" style="s2">day almost every one of them externalize</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.980" end="01:04:05.460" style="s2">as some harm to the Commons right almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.060" end="01:04:08.820" style="s2">every product involved unhhhh renewable</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.270" end="01:04:19.130" style="s2">mediate them so if I&#39;ve got 70 trillion</p>

<p begin="01:04:19.130" end="01:04:24.030" style="s2">externalizing harm towards points of</p>

<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:47.880" style="s2">alright can we have a macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.940" end="01:05:50.070" style="s2">system where themes are worth more to us</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.880" end="01:05:53.700" style="s2">dead and alive and we actually need that</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.070" end="01:05:56.010" style="s2">because if I don&#39;t get stuff then my</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.700" end="01:05:57.510" style="s2">kids starve and then once they are done</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.010" end="01:05:58.920" style="s2">starving they don&#39;t get to go to college</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.510" end="01:06:02.700" style="s2">and so every level of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>

<p begin="01:06:05.660" end="01:06:11.310" style="s2">so then it&#39;s how could we change that</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.910" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">macroeconomic system cuz economics is</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.310" end="01:06:15.600" style="s2">right at the interface between our</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.600" end="01:06:20.460" style="s2">do I value it right it&#39;s a value system</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.929" end="01:12:49.230" style="s2">and then do something about it but since</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.090" end="01:12:52.230" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to do a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.230" end="01:12:54.090" style="s2">of it like how do you inspire the next</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.230" end="01:12:55.860" style="s2">set of people to get to do some of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.090" end="01:12:57.179" style="s2">things how do you attract a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.860" end="01:12:58.710" style="s2">people to work on some of the things</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.179" end="01:13:01.139" style="s2">that you&#39;re working on right now like</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.710" end="01:13:02.820" style="s2">how do you keep on requesting and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.139" end="01:13:04.139" style="s2">filtering down and getting to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.820" end="01:13:06.150" style="s2">essentials of what&#39;s gonna make a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.139" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">difference today as opposed to what just</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.150" end="01:13:11.340" style="s2">looks good or it gets a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:14.369" style="s2">likes on social media right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.340" end="01:13:16.260" style="s2">like my first stop was as a physicist</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.369" end="01:13:19.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s like at the end of the day like</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.260" end="01:13:23.340" style="s2">matter energy you know is gonna change</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.710" end="01:13:25.170" style="s2">or nothing changed right so like when I</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.340" end="01:13:26.820" style="s2">see like things or it&#39;s like oh this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.170" end="01:13:28.769" style="s2">a person that&#39;s so good at like online</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.820" end="01:13:30.989" style="s2">whatever and I&#39;m like well what what</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.769" end="01:13:32.250" style="s2">were the atoms that changed and if</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.989" end="01:13:34.260" style="s2">nothing changed and I&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.250" end="01:13:36.059" style="s2">nothing changed and I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.260" end="01:13:37.530" style="s2">a jerk it&#39;s just like let&#39;s keep it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.059" end="01:13:40.079" style="s2">practical let&#39;s keep it really clean</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.530" end="01:13:42.150" style="s2">let&#39;s stick with our the atoms and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.079" end="01:13:43.590" style="s2">energy changing if it isn&#39;t then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.150" end="01:13:45.329" style="s2">just go back to it and see if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.590" end="01:13:46.650" style="s2">another way to do it where the atoms and</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.329" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">energy would change a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.650" end="01:13:50.789" style="s2">and if that not that then we&#39;ll try it</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:52.829" style="s2">again a little bit more try it again a</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.789" end="01:13:54.539" style="s2">little bit more but eventually you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.829" end="01:13:57.090" style="s2">figure out how to do your two percent</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.539" end="01:13:58.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s all right like that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.090" end="01:14:01.260" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do in this life and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.559" end="01:14:03.739" style="s2">it&#39;s phenomenal so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.260" end="01:14:03.739" style="s2">probably all</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.450" end="01:14:13.450" style="s2">so I think the question is like what</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.010" end="01:14:16.310" style="s2">puts you in that flow state right um</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.450" end="01:14:19.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you what takes me out of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.310" end="01:14:22.250" style="s2">is a shadow I see you know in our</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.010" end="01:14:26.350" style="s2">culture on the edge is you with you with</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.250" end="01:14:30.380" style="s2">you if I can bring myself geographically</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.350" end="01:14:32.989" style="s2">physically emotionally mentally and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.380" end="01:14:36.560" style="s2">spiritually near the thing I want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.989" end="01:14:39.410" style="s2">impact and have that my consciousness be</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.560" end="01:14:42.170" style="s2">located where it is as close as I can</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.410" end="01:14:45.200" style="s2">get it where it is part of me and I am</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.170" end="01:14:47.870" style="s2">part of it then I am not the one that</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.200" end="01:14:50.600" style="s2">needs to be smart I never will be</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.870" end="01:14:53.780" style="s2">because I am sourcing my motivations my</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.600" end="01:14:56.540" style="s2">intelligence my resources from everyone</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.780" end="01:14:59.660" style="s2">who cares about that thing you know if I</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.540" end="01:15:02.120" style="s2">focus my my my reality on solving</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.660" end="01:15:03.739" style="s2">poverty then there&#39;s billions of people</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.120" end="01:15:06.380" style="s2">that care about solving that and now I</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.739" end="01:15:10.310" style="s2">have the resources of all of them on my</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.380" end="01:15:12.770" style="s2">side cheering me on and when I can take</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.310" end="01:15:16.969" style="s2">my focus my consciousness my</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.770" end="01:15:18.469" style="s2">identification and put it out there not</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.969" end="01:15:20.660" style="s2">be all the way absorbed in my own</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.469" end="01:15:23.330" style="s2">experience but actually include you in</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.660" end="01:15:25.810" style="s2">my experience all of a sudden when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.330" end="01:15:28.040" style="s2">have a yearning question and it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.810" end="01:15:30.620" style="s2">excited me talking anymore</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.040" end="01:15:32.900" style="s2">it&#39;s you in your Higher Self and mine</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.620" end="01:15:34.610" style="s2">having a conversation and I just do one</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:38.010" style="s2">of the deliverers and one of the faces</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.610" end="01:15:40.770" style="s2">for you as you are for me</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.010" end="01:15:42.780" style="s2">and so for me that&#39;s where flow state</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.770" end="01:15:47.340" style="s2">occurs is when I can identify with a</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.780" end="01:15:49.770" style="s2">larger concern and that&#39;s what I do the</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.340" end="01:15:51.470" style="s2">second thing I do is meditation which</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.770" end="01:15:53.940" style="s2">may sound paradoxical</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.470" end="01:15:58.440" style="s2">all right so meditation is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.940" end="01:16:03.030" style="s2">about taking out all of the stimulus for</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.440" end="01:16:05.460" style="s2">a moment we are so stimulated and for me</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.030" end="01:16:08.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a practice of getting comfort in</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.460" end="01:16:12.030" style="s2">the discomfort of the fertile void where</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.730" end="01:16:13.710" style="s2">there is nothing and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.030" end="01:16:18.780" style="s2">anything adulterating my consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.710" end="01:16:20.670" style="s2">and then I allow what needs to arise</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.780" end="01:16:22.740" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the active feminine</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.670" end="01:16:25.500" style="s2">form of power and influence that is my</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.740" end="01:16:28.530" style="s2">leadership model that I teach I get into</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.500" end="01:16:31.020" style="s2">that and see what is the field when I</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.530" end="01:16:33.900" style="s2">kind of reduce all of the other stimuli</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.020" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">what is the intuition say you know we</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.900" end="01:16:39.300" style="s2">have two forms of intelligence in my</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:41.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a gross over generalization but we</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.300" end="01:16:42.150" style="s2">have like a discriminative mind that if</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.340" end="01:16:45.000" style="s2">valuates</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.150" end="01:16:46.830" style="s2">compares looks at past and sees what</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.000" end="01:16:49.290" style="s2">should we do based on what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.830" end="01:16:52.110" style="s2">and before it&#39;s it&#39;s an incredible form</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.290" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">of intelligence we need that form but</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.110" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s the intuitive mind and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.480" end="01:17:00.270" style="s2">intuitive mind is pulling vast multiple</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:03.240" style="s2">simultaneous inputs all at once it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.270" end="01:17:05.070" style="s2">vast that we can&#39;t actually compress it</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.240" end="01:17:09.060" style="s2">and understand it so it comes as an</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.070" end="01:17:11.190" style="s2">impulse from that fro void and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.060" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">much more intelligent because this</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.190" end="01:17:18.390" style="s2">intelligence includes all of us and all</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:20.580" style="s2">life so my practice is to either locate</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.390" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">myself with you out of my self</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.580" end="01:17:24.540" style="s2">absorption or with the challenge and all</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:27.390" style="s2">of the resources that are available</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.540" end="01:17:29.370" style="s2">there or to cut the stimulus and go into</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.390" end="01:17:34.670" style="s2">the intuitive fertile void and feel the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.370" end="01:17:38.040" style="s2">field and from there I just marvel at</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.670" end="01:17:52.410" style="s2">the creativity that I am just a humble</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.040" end="01:17:54.510" style="s2">receiver of so Jennifer actually shared</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.410" end="01:17:57.690" style="s2">something that triggered a deep Blake</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.510" end="01:17:59.340" style="s2">philosophy you see how she practices the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.690" end="01:18:01.620" style="s2">intuitive intelligence and the analytic</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.340" end="01:18:03.510" style="s2">both rate and the masculine and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.620" end="01:18:06.180" style="s2">feminine and the active and the you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.510" end="01:18:09.690" style="s2">passive one of the deep kind of life</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.180" end="01:18:16.440" style="s2">philosophies for me is transcending and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.690" end="01:18:19.080" style="s2">reconciling false dichotomies so if my</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.440" end="01:18:20.910" style="s2">logical thinking about something and my</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.080" end="01:18:21.570" style="s2">intuitive sense on something are in</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.910" end="01:18:22.980" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.570" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t move forward with either until</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.980" end="01:18:27.810" style="s2">they&#39;re not in conflict because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:31.110" style="s2">actually both meaningful types of</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.810" end="01:18:33.090" style="s2">intelligence and one of them or both of</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.110" end="01:18:34.530" style="s2">them are not fully there yet if they</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.090" end="01:18:37.110" style="s2">haven&#39;t brought me to a commensurate</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.530" end="01:18:39.980" style="s2">place so that&#39;s kind of a key thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.110" end="01:18:42.300" style="s2">right if you think that they&#39;re just the</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.980" end="01:18:43.890" style="s2">fundamental internal conflict where you</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.300" end="01:18:45.470" style="s2">go with one of them and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.890" end="01:18:49.320" style="s2">you respect either of those tools enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.470" end="01:18:51.090" style="s2">if what it seems like is gonna be in my</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.320" end="01:18:52.440" style="s2">best interest and what&#39;s in the best</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.090" end="01:18:53.850" style="s2">interest of someone else seem in</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.440" end="01:18:55.450" style="s2">conflict they don&#39;t move forward until</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.850" end="01:18:56.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve reconciled that</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:06.670" style="s2">kind of see this everywhere where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.260" end="01:19:08.920" style="s2">like when you understand how</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.670" end="01:19:10.900" style="s2">interconnected universe is then you</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.920" end="01:19:13.710" style="s2">realize that everything that matters is</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.900" end="01:19:16.330" style="s2">inter commensurate and none of it in</p>

<p begin="01:19:16.330" end="01:19:21.250" style="s2">this is key to so many things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.730" end="01:19:23.050" style="s2">like do I want to love the moment</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.250" end="01:19:24.310" style="s2">exactly the way it is or do I want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.050" end="01:19:26.500" style="s2">work to make a better future and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.310" end="01:19:28.420" style="s2">answer is against both right and those</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.500" end="01:19:30.820" style="s2">are totally reconcilable without a weird</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.420" end="01:19:32.920" style="s2">thought of paradox because as Tom said</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.820" end="01:19:34.900" style="s2">were more verbs and we are nouns and all</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.460" end="01:21:44.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no failure to innovate it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.170" end="01:21:47.900" style="s2">literally a failure to communicate and</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.300" end="01:21:50.630" style="s2">my greatest gift is meeting you guys</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.900" end="01:21:53.930" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been on this planet 28</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.630" end="01:21:56.210" style="s2">years I&#39;ve never met anyone like me and</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.930" end="01:21:59.090" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to fund me because this</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.210" end="01:22:01.790" style="s2">thing was like I go into a meeting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.090" end="01:22:03.020" style="s2">like this is a seesaw effect here was</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.790" end="01:22:06.050" style="s2">national security</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.020" end="01:22:08.420" style="s2">here&#39;s consumer this was like insights</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.050" end="01:22:09.739" style="s2">here&#39;s innovation this is how everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.420" end="01:22:12.050" style="s2">else got these really complicated</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.739" end="01:22:14.330" style="s2">products that we do every single day and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.050" end="01:22:16.190" style="s2">then there&#39;s like this triangle which</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.330" end="01:22:17.930" style="s2">was the fulcrum of the seesaw which is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.190" end="01:22:22.099" style="s2">like the insights and then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.930" end="01:22:25.289" style="s2">needs the data now to like do stuff whoa</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.099" end="01:22:27.239" style="s2">how do we do it so my question is how do</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.289" end="01:22:28.050" style="s2">we do it together I can&#39;t do it alone</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.239" end="01:22:30.659" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.050" end="01:22:33.719" style="s2">and you guys work on brain stuff I liked</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.659" end="01:22:35.730" style="s2">spent the past year detangling my brains</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.719" end="01:22:38.969" style="s2">I understand human cognition and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.730" end="01:22:40.559" style="s2">like that and it&#39;s really cool but if we</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.969" end="01:22:42.780" style="s2">keep click click click click clicking</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.559" end="01:22:44.909" style="s2">into interface to interface we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.780" end="01:22:47.519" style="s2">lose the fact that the last secure thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.909" end="01:22:49.170" style="s2">is our mind and that is so insecure so</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.519" end="01:22:51.570" style="s2">we really need to start instituting new</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.170" end="01:22:53.429" style="s2">beliefs and new customs and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.570" end="01:22:56.400" style="s2">culture universally in this information</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.429" end="01:22:58.559" style="s2">sea to pass that down baggage there next</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.400" end="01:23:00.210" style="s2">generations and like that too that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.559" end="01:23:03.619" style="s2">big question so that&#39;s not a direct</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.210" end="01:23:11.639" style="s2">question that&#39;s like for everybody here</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.619" end="01:23:14.670" style="s2">ok cool thanks thanks ok that&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="01:23:14.670" end="01:23:18.869" style="s2">big difference between like knowing</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.070" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna need to happen and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.869" end="01:23:24.360" style="s2">doing of this stuff and what I&#39;ll say is</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:26.249" style="s2">that your worry and frustration are not</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.929" end="01:23:31.349" style="s2">that if something&#39;s really important you</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.610" end="01:23:32.369" style="s2">got to worry about it more but when</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.349" end="01:23:33.719" style="s2">you&#39;re worried about it more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.369" end="01:23:36.179" style="s2">bringing less of yourself the worry</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.719" end="01:23:38.340" style="s2">itself is like a battle brain your brain</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.179" end="01:23:40.739" style="s2">sucks when it&#39;s worried you can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.809" end="01:24:28.050" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go talk to a group of</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.039" end="01:24:29.219" style="s2">second graders and give your PhD lecture</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.050" end="01:24:31.229" style="s2">that is not going to go</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.219" end="01:24:33.329" style="s2">that well especially if the output of</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.229" end="01:24:34.920" style="s2">your PhD lecture means they lose status</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.329" end="01:24:36.360" style="s2">in the world where they need to change</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.920" end="01:24:38.249" style="s2">how they do things and so on and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.360" end="01:24:39.989" style="s2">forth that&#39;s crazy town that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.619" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">is an enlightening lesson to you right</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.590" end="01:24:54.150" style="s2">and like when the second graders hear</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:55.769" style="s2">that they&#39;re like oh follow through</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.150" end="01:24:56.699" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know about fractions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.769" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">pretty cool man</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.699" end="01:25:01.769" style="s2">I like fractions not sure maybe you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:25:37.800" end="01:25:41.369" style="s2">great maybe we&#39;ll go off and we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.749" end="01:25:43.050" style="s2">like some graduate school talk we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.369" end="01:25:45.869" style="s2">have some postdoc talk that&#39;d be that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.050" end="01:25:47.820" style="s2">be freaking fun but like don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.869" end="01:25:50.550" style="s2">about it that everybody&#39;s not talking</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.820" end="01:25:52.170" style="s2">like that like your goal is somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.550" end="01:25:54.119" style="s2">is trying to be of service in the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.170" end="01:25:56.820" style="s2">is if they&#39;re in second grade let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.119" end="01:25:58.110" style="s2">teach third and actually let me learn</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.820" end="01:25:59.400" style="s2">some stuff too because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.110" end="01:26:02.639" style="s2">stuff I can learn from a second grader</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.400" end="01:26:04.949" style="s2">that&#39;s freaking great it&#39;s just so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.639" end="01:26:08.909" style="s2">worry so much bring it down to the level</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.949" end="01:26:12.320" style="s2">just keep in it yet and yeah just go a</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.909" end="01:26:12.320" style="s2">grade up maybe two</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.830" end="01:26:19.910" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.670" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.910" end="01:26:26.670" style="s2">and mentioned was a question of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:28.080" style="s2">the abundance of error for example in</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.670" end="01:26:31.280" style="s2">the lack of value how much is their</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.080" end="01:26:34.410" style="s2">worth I think some of it probably</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:37.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we have to recognize our</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.410" end="01:26:39.420" style="s2">privilege and being able to sort of take</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.290" end="01:26:41.970" style="s2">that step back and see that air has</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.420" end="01:26:44.520" style="s2">value versus perhaps the immediate need</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.970" end="01:26:46.620" style="s2">for food or water or shelter or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.520" end="01:26:49.260" style="s2">it might be so I&#39;m wondering how you</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.620" end="01:26:53.040" style="s2">think about sort of toppling systems</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.260" end="01:26:54.810" style="s2">where perhaps some of those thinking not</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.040" end="01:26:57.900" style="s2">all of it but is happening in rooms like</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.810" end="01:26:59.190" style="s2">this and which is not the room that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.900" end="01:27:01.170" style="s2">know billions of people in the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.190" end="01:27:03.030" style="s2">during happening so wondering about that</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.170" end="01:27:04.950" style="s2">and and then I personally have been</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.030" end="01:27:06.750" style="s2">doing a lot of my work in financial</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.950" end="01:27:09.470" style="s2">services and in agriculture in food</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.750" end="01:27:11.640" style="s2">security and a lot of sort of my last</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.470" end="01:27:13.260" style="s2">seven years of living and working in</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.640" end="01:27:15.330" style="s2">Africa has been about like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.260" end="01:27:17.910" style="s2">create new systems for these things that</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.330" end="01:27:21.090" style="s2">actually work for smallholder farmers or</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.910" end="01:27:23.190" style="s2">for small medium enterprises and my view</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.090" end="01:27:25.020" style="s2">is that similarly you know things needs</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.190" end="01:27:26.700" style="s2">to be broken and that what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.020" end="01:27:28.920" style="s2">right now with some of the mergers with</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.700" end="01:27:30.750" style="s2">a lot of the existing provision of these</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.920" end="01:27:33.180" style="s2">services is not working and not</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.750" end="01:27:35.970" style="s2">beneficials and wondering if you outside</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.180" end="01:27:39.210" style="s2">of the thinking side the brain and found</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.970" end="01:27:42.560" style="s2">organizations or models that you think</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.210" end="01:27:46.670" style="s2">can actually lead to this new sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:46.670" style="s2">macro and micro economy</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.240" end="01:27:52.610" style="s2">so I&#39;ll say something towards that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.170" end="01:27:55.670" style="s2">be able to speak to it adequately in</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.610" end="01:27:58.460" style="s2">this time but I&#39;m happy to speak deeper</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.670" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">later and share some things on exactly</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.460" end="01:28:03.080" style="s2">those topics one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:05.990" style="s2">happened that was me that was the most</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.080" end="01:28:07.790" style="s2">challenging for me early on was we</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.990" end="01:28:09.170" style="s2">talked to some of the people at the UN</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.790" end="01:28:11.330" style="s2">World Food Programme on how to end world</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.170" end="01:28:13.580" style="s2">hunger and they showed their very</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.330" end="01:28:16.850" style="s2">comprehensive plan on how to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.580" end="01:28:18.980" style="s2">it involved things like more NPK</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.850" end="01:28:20.930" style="s2">fertilizer near a bunch of river deltas</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.980" end="01:28:22.490" style="s2">that leads to more dead zones in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.930" end="01:28:24.080" style="s2">ocean towards the point of actual auto</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.490" end="01:28:26.000" style="s2">catalysis the extinction of our entire</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.080" end="01:28:29.420" style="s2">species and I said well it&#39;s not such a</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.000" end="01:28:31.490" style="s2">great plan because you&#39;re metric of less</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.420" end="01:28:33.350" style="s2">people dying this year is actually good</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.490" end="01:28:36.560" style="s2">but we kind of all go extinct if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.350" end="01:28:38.690" style="s2">succeed too faster and they&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.560" end="01:28:41.330" style="s2">that makes sense but those aren&#39;t our</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.690" end="01:28:42.890" style="s2">metrics were tasked with and I talked to</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.330" end="01:28:44.450" style="s2">the guys at the IPCC on climate change</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.890" end="01:28:45.170" style="s2">on geoengineering and they&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.450" end="01:28:46.700" style="s2">do you think about these particular</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.170" end="01:28:48.890" style="s2">sulfates in the atmosphere to reflect</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.700" end="01:28:51.050" style="s2">20% of the Sun out so that we get the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.890" end="01:28:52.340" style="s2">temperature down like well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.050" end="01:28:54.230" style="s2">externalities of doing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.340" end="01:28:55.610" style="s2">really bad and you didn&#39;t address any of</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.230" end="01:28:56.720" style="s2">the underlying cause and here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.610" end="01:28:58.700" style="s2">other things happen that are really bad</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.720" end="01:29:00.260" style="s2">and again we&#39;re actually accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.700" end="01:29:01.610" style="s2">extinction and they&#39;re again like well</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.260" end="01:29:06.530" style="s2">those aren&#39;t our metrics or metric as</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.610" end="01:29:08.780" style="s2">temperature so one of the and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.530" end="01:29:11.630" style="s2">gave up on retrofitting those systems as</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.780" end="01:29:13.820" style="s2">others building one is rain and the same</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.630" end="01:29:17.450" style="s2">in macroeconomics says anything that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.820" end="01:29:20.150" style="s2">affected has to be internalized - the</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.450" end="01:29:21.710" style="s2">equation that determines incentive</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.150" end="01:29:24.320" style="s2">decision-making and how power is</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.710" end="01:29:26.120" style="s2">conferred and as long as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.320" end="01:29:28.010" style="s2">anything that is external bias to that</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.120" end="01:29:30.920" style="s2">gap of externality will be the badness</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.010" end="01:29:32.240" style="s2">of the strategy so without getting into</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.920" end="01:29:33.620" style="s2">the specifics right now and so it love</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.240" end="01:29:34.580" style="s2">to do indefinitely because it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.620" end="01:29:34.910" style="s2">like you&#39;re doing really great work I</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.580" end="01:29:36.620" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.910" end="01:29:39.230" style="s2">just like Tom talks about as a design</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.620" end="01:29:41.060" style="s2">process like be in the work and make</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.230" end="01:29:42.290" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s actually you know working</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.060" end="01:29:43.730" style="s2">the prototype but another one I would</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.290" end="01:29:45.950" style="s2">say is make sure that you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.730" end="01:29:46.650" style="s2">about the entire system all of the cause</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.950" end="01:29:48.870" style="s2">that come</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.650" end="01:29:50.790" style="s2">all of the effects coming out make sure</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.870" end="01:29:52.170" style="s2">you&#39;re internalizing the externalities</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.790" end="01:29:54.060" style="s2">and you&#39;re factoring complex</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.170" end="01:29:55.620" style="s2">cause-and-effect just as a design</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.060" end="01:29:58.350" style="s2">thinking for whether you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.620" end="01:29:59.909" style="s2">hunger or how to address poverty or the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.350" end="01:30:01.710" style="s2">relationship between hunger and poverty</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.909" end="01:30:05.190" style="s2">or the so that&#39;s just that&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.710" end="01:30:07.170" style="s2">Design Thinking thing make sense and I</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.190" end="01:30:09.179" style="s2">just wanted to say forgive me</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.170" end="01:30:11.310" style="s2">real quick one more thing to your</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.179" end="01:30:13.739" style="s2">question earlier I will triple down on</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.310" end="01:30:15.179" style="s2">everything Tom said and feedback to you</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.739" end="01:30:16.380" style="s2">one other thing on six I think it</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.179" end="01:30:20.040" style="s2">probably comes up for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.380" end="01:30:21.960" style="s2">here no one can adequately define</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.040" end="01:30:24.570" style="s2">themselves whatever their definition is</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.960" end="01:30:26.280" style="s2">is wrong it is a definition of some</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.570" end="01:30:27.780" style="s2">function they have or some role they</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.280" end="01:30:32.250" style="s2">play which is cool and useful but not</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.780" end="01:30:34.140" style="s2">then if you try and be understood by</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.250" end="01:30:35.489" style="s2">defining yourself like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.140" end="01:30:39.239" style="s2">you&#39;re just never gonna succeed with</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.489" end="01:30:41.219" style="s2">that so give up on that totally and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.239" end="01:30:45.150" style="s2">degree to which you can give up on</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.219" end="01:30:47.460" style="s2">wanting to be understood in that way it</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.150" end="01:30:48.900" style="s2">will help things go so much better so</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.460" end="01:30:50.370" style="s2">when I&#39;m talking to people in they ask</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.900" end="01:30:51.449" style="s2">kind of my background I&#39;d like to get</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.370" end="01:30:52.949" style="s2">their background first and I say</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.449" end="01:30:54.750" style="s2">whatever&#39;s relevant about me I don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.949" end="01:30:56.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t try and have them give me just I</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.750" end="01:30:58.980" style="s2">wanted to be relevant so the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.400" end="01:31:01.050" style="s2">which you can decouple your own desire</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.980" end="01:31:02.640" style="s2">for belonging being understood with how</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.050" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">to actually be effective on a project</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.640" end="01:31:05.940" style="s2">super helpful and then you&#39;ll have some</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:07.890" style="s2">people that you&#39;re really close within</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.940" end="01:31:09.390" style="s2">or personally that you feel like brought</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.890" end="01:31:11.010" style="s2">to you not because of a bio but because</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.390" end="01:31:12.449" style="s2">they cross you and those are two</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.010" end="01:31:14.580" style="s2">different ways to get those things met</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.449" end="01:31:16.469" style="s2">and then it&#39;s much easier to do what Tom</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.580" end="01:31:20.550" style="s2">said of just share a relevant thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.469" end="01:31:22.890" style="s2">because it actually is not about any in</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.550" end="01:31:24.390" style="s2">a relational process and I would just</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.890" end="01:31:25.949" style="s2">kind of share with everybody here if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.390" end="01:31:27.750" style="s2">are thinking about what the those</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.949" end="01:31:29.460" style="s2">guys are so smart or those guys are what</p>
