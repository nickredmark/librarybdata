<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">what we should need to do is get</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">yourself ready oh if you could I always</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">ask you to do this because it&#39;s helpful</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:47.259" style="s2">perhaps by resetting five promises to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.780" end="00:19:00.850" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.460" end="00:19:06.340" style="s2">we have time for a question or two</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.850" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">perhaps so these throw your clan I hope</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.510" end="00:19:13.720" style="s2">I start with my posture straighten after</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.430" end="00:19:15.250" style="s2">a few minutes I&#39;d tend to see the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.720" end="00:19:19.180" style="s2">morlocks on the base of my spine is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.250" end="00:19:20.890" style="s2">okay so if I&#39;m trying to make sure I get</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.180" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">this okay the idea is sort of like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.890" end="00:19:26.170" style="s2">and then you relax down a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.100" end="00:19:27.880" style="s2">well you shouldn&#39;t be sort of a rep like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.170" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">this and holding yourself up you should</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.880" end="00:19:34.410" style="s2">actually be sort of sunk down and when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">do that I feel my sits bone touching</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.410" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">myself food my pillow and that allows my</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:44.050" style="s2">shoulders down open loves my stomach</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">open so I think if I&#39;m understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.050" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">correctly that&#39;s actually what you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:51.460" style="s2">you want that sense not of holding</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">yourself up but of actually sinking down</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.460" end="00:19:55.720" style="s2">you&#39;re a rat but you&#39;re sunk and open</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:58.630" style="s2">and you should be making that very</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.720" end="00:20:01.780" style="s2">definite contact with the base of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.630" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">spine with your pillow or your chair of</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.090" style="s2">welcome Phillip asks since music is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.710" end="00:20:11.950" style="s2">lot like poetry could something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.090" end="00:20:14.410" style="s2">lick Co Divina be applied to listening</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.950" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">to music or transformation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.410" end="00:20:21.190" style="s2">great question I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:23.580" style="s2">tried that one of the advantages of Lexi</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.190" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">o is it acts as a bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.580" end="00:20:28.900" style="s2">propositional and not propositional</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:31.930" style="s2">cognition between for more abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.900" end="00:20:33.720" style="s2">more embodied cognition music was</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.930" end="00:20:38.260" style="s2">already much more sort of non</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.720" end="00:20:40.990" style="s2">propositional and embodied and playing</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.260" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">with salience landscaping and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.990" end="00:20:47.590" style="s2">realization so I suppose what I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.440" end="00:20:50.830" style="s2">say therefore and please remember what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.590" end="00:20:53.560" style="s2">said I&#39;m ignorant of specifically trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.830" end="00:20:57.370" style="s2">to apply the practice to Lexia so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.560" end="00:20:59.620" style="s2">speculating here but given some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.370" end="00:21:04.510" style="s2">goals of Luxio I would not recommend</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.620" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">replacing Alexio with text or poetry</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.510" end="00:21:09.310" style="s2">with music because you&#39;re losing some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:14.770" style="s2">what you&#39;re gaining when the Alexio is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.310" end="00:21:16.540" style="s2">with text the sense of logos as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.770" end="00:21:20.230" style="s2">bridge between the proposition or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.540" end="00:21:21.940" style="s2">non propositional but I see no reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.230" end="00:21:26.290" style="s2">why you couldn&#39;t apply something why</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.940" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">collects you in addition to music and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.290" end="00:21:32.620" style="s2">I&#39;d be interested in knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:33.430" style="s2">happens when you do so so one more</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.430" end="00:22:07.000" style="s2">I read sequentially and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:08.650" style="s2">recommended because it&#39;s recommended</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:56.920" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure about this because I</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:06.130" style="s2">creamy you are having success</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.460" end="00:23:09.400" style="s2">I recommend alternating between the two</p>
