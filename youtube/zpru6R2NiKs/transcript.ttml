<p begin="00:19:06.470" end="00:19:10.009" style="s2">directing Letta toward yourself should</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.149" end="00:19:11.450" style="s2">be pictured to be picturing an image of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.009" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">yourself for sensing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.450" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">I generally it&#39;s recommended that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:19.220" style="s2">try sensing yourself and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:21.499" style="s2">you try sensing this area this is sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.220" end="00:19:24.649" style="s2">of the body armor area associated with</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.499" end="00:19:27.740" style="s2">one&#39;s ego and center for some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.649" end="00:19:29.899" style="s2">it&#39;s more here but this seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.740" end="00:19:32.659" style="s2">very good place you know because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.899" end="00:19:35.019" style="s2">sort of our emotional center and things</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.659" end="00:19:38.119" style="s2">like that at least where we embody it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.019" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">so I recommend kind of sense yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.119" end="00:19:45.769" style="s2">especially this spot as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">relate to an image of yourself under a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.769" end="00:19:50.119" style="s2">Fed when trying to find my phone I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.769" style="s2">understand it as starting with following</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.119" end="00:19:53.029" style="s2">the breath in the abdomen and expanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.769" end="00:19:54.409" style="s2">the witness to chest and upper body</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.029" end="00:19:56.539" style="s2">paying attention to all the body</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.409" end="00:19:58.190" style="s2">sensations and trying to do the sick</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.539" end="00:20:00.619" style="s2">Leslie isn&#39;t there a risk of my body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.190" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">you bullshitting me I imagine generating</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.619" end="00:20:04.820" style="s2">those feelings and sensations am I</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:09.350" style="s2">supposed to accept it as a as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.820" end="00:20:11.830" style="s2">process that will go away well it could</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.350" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">be that your body is generating</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.830" end="00:20:20.029" style="s2">sensations that are illusory but then</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:22.549" style="s2">what you might want to do is ask what</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.029" end="00:20:25.220" style="s2">standard you&#39;d be applying against that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.549" end="00:20:28.129" style="s2">what is the standard you&#39;re using to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.220" end="00:20:31.129" style="s2">well I think you know well what would</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.129" end="00:20:34.460" style="s2">you use in order to realize that those</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.129" end="00:20:37.119" style="s2">sensations are not actually being</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.460" end="00:20:41.210" style="s2">generated by your body but just imagined</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.119" end="00:20:43.570" style="s2">it&#39;s unclear what that would be I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.210" end="00:20:46.309" style="s2">I think it&#39;s unclear like it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.570" end="00:20:50.529" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference at that level</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.309" end="00:20:53.210" style="s2">between imagining and perception is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.529" end="00:20:55.330" style="s2">when you&#39;re paying attention to your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.210" end="00:20:57.710" style="s2">mind the very doubt that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.330" end="00:21:00.019" style="s2">the thought that you&#39;re having are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.710" end="00:21:03.019" style="s2">imagining that thought you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.019" end="00:21:04.549" style="s2">having that thought you see when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.019" end="00:21:05.929" style="s2">getting down to those depths and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.549" end="00:21:07.940" style="s2">what the car decides to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.929" end="00:21:09.769" style="s2">Machinery by which you&#39;re perceiving is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.940" end="00:21:11.419" style="s2">the machinery by which you&#39;re imagining</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.769" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re getting into those depths</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.419" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">trying to find the clean line between</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.440" style="s2">imagination perception I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:21.619" style="s2">concerned that it&#39;s a kind of false</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.440" end="00:21:24.049" style="s2">precision it&#39;s not findable because of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.619" end="00:21:26.629" style="s2">the deep functional interpenetration so</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.049" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">I recommend going with the practice we</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.629" end="00:21:32.389" style="s2">do have a standard of all just Rea</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.899" style="s2">explain it the standard is auto and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.389" end="00:21:38.600" style="s2">a standard of transformative truths not</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.899" end="00:21:42.019" style="s2">just a sense of conviction is your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.600" end="00:21:44.090" style="s2">being transformed in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.019" end="00:21:46.269" style="s2">internalized abow into your practice and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.090" end="00:21:48.710" style="s2">is what&#39;s happening your practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.269" end="00:21:52.149" style="s2">leading to transformation in your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.710" end="00:21:55.999" style="s2">especially as noticed by other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.149" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">and if you could and you can stand back</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.999" end="00:22:01.940" style="s2">and say what if all of thats an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:04.129" style="s2">and then the problem with that is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.940" end="00:22:06.049" style="s2">higher standard where where would you go</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.129" end="00:22:09.499" style="s2">where would you be standing when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.049" end="00:22:11.899" style="s2">were trying to make that evaluation it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.499" end="00:22:16.429" style="s2">seems to me that what we ultimately have</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.899" end="00:22:19.730" style="s2">to fall back on is is our life as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.429" end="00:22:21.590" style="s2">whole as comprehensively and coherently</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.730" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">as possible and that means both inner</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.590" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">and outer opening up are we feeling more</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:30.259" style="s2">connected and is that reliably coherent</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">with our ability to make sense to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.259" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">connections to make friends etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:42.860" style="s2">ultimately that&#39;s a kind of Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:46.039" style="s2">pragmatism I would say so I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.860" end="00:22:48.649" style="s2">practical advice for you Andrea is if</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.039" end="00:22:50.809" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing that flow and it&#39;s</p>
