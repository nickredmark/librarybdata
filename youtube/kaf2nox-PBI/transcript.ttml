<p begin="00:00:02.520" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">strategies of writing that basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">communicate two messages one message to</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">the superficial reader and another</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">message to the far smaller set of slow</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:19.170" style="s2">thoughtful careful readers and he made</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">more he put more on the table than</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">anybody else had done before the methods</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">deliberate contradictions another method</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.820" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">that he mentions is that sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:36.660" style="s2">have an author who repeats himself and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">he says like as I said earlier but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.660" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">repetition includes a modification of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:42.210" style="s2">what was said earlier so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">reading carefully you see that he said</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.210" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">one thing first and then something else</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">later and you&#39;re supposed to notice that</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">necessary for the community and it also</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">subjects them to questioning for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">puppies of the philosophical race as he</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">put it somewhere for the for the young</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">men who love to think that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">fascinating that with that context</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">reading Bronze Age mindset by Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">pervert I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">that really puts that book into context</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">because he I know he&#39;s probably say</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">Strauss Ian and I know that he certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">and studied the ancient texts quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">bit but the writing style there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">definitely more than one audience in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">the in the in the way he was writing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">and some of it was intended to push</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">people away and some of and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">it was the sort of hidden messages for</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">the people who were really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">about it and paying attention to it can</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">you recommend any books by Biden Strauss</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">here that actually speaks to this sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">of technique because I&#39;d like to check</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">that out personally the source book is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">called persecution in the art of writing</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s where he says in general why</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">this type of writing was needed why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">a problem and why it hasn&#39;t been noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:06.509" style="s2">until he basically put a light on it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">then he also has a few studies there of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">medieval thinkers where he tries to show</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">you how they did this and how to read</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">them if you read them</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">this in mind but persecution in the art</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">of writing is the main text for that</p>
