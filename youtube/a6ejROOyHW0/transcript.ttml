<p begin="00:00:53.530" end="00:00:57.670" style="s2">wanted to do a life update so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.449" end="00:00:59.619" style="s2">joined the MIT Media labs digital</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.670" end="00:01:01.629" style="s2">currency initiative as their head of</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.089" end="00:01:08.710" style="s2">nice group of blind people there so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.299" end="00:01:10.810" style="s2">means that I&#39;m gonna shut down my</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.710" end="00:01:13.330" style="s2">patreon I&#39;ve shut down my patreon and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.810" end="00:01:15.460" style="s2">that this podcast will likely continue</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.330" end="00:01:17.140" style="s2">but possibly in a different form with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.460" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">the Media Lab or with the DCI or</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.140" end="00:01:22.750" style="s2">whatever so we&#39;ll see and I just another</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:24.939" style="s2">quick note there my this podcast was</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.750" end="00:01:27.009" style="s2">recorded before I joined the DCI so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.939" end="00:01:29.049" style="s2">clearly these are my views and do not</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.009" end="00:01:31.870" style="s2">reflect those of the digital currency</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.049" end="00:01:33.820" style="s2">initiative of the DCI so with that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.870" end="00:01:36.490" style="s2">get to today&#39;s episode and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.820" end="00:01:37.720" style="s2">interview Danish Mactan burger today and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.490" end="00:01:39.340" style="s2">Daniel&#39;s done a lot of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.720" end="00:01:41.050" style="s2">these you know kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.340" end="00:01:43.480" style="s2">complex macro systems that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.050" end="00:01:44.740" style="s2">and that&#39;s just a quick I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.480" end="00:01:46.780" style="s2">know if it&#39;s a warning it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.740" end="00:01:48.730" style="s2">excitement Daniel and I really like</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.780" end="00:01:53.620" style="s2">operating at these levels of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.730" end="00:01:56.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s where we got when we today</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.620" end="00:01:59.440" style="s2">about one big topic which is a meta X</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.260" end="00:02:01.750" style="s2">risk and so this is not only thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.440" end="00:02:03.370" style="s2">about kind of traditional and bi extras</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.750" end="00:02:05.350" style="s2">I mean existential risk so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.370" end="00:02:06.729" style="s2">traditional thing about like existential</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.350" end="00:02:08.979" style="s2">risks like climate change nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.729" end="00:02:10.869" style="s2">security biosecurity or AI alignment</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.979" end="00:02:13.569" style="s2">instead it&#39;s asking a question what</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.869" end="00:02:15.400" style="s2">actually creates those X risks what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.569" end="00:02:18.159" style="s2">creates those existential risks and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.400" end="00:02:19.750" style="s2">can think of this as something like two</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.159" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">kinds of processes where we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.750" end="00:02:25.239" style="s2">evolution as a process and evolution was</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:27.670" style="s2">a generally a nice process that um thank</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.239" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">you evolution for creating me evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.670" end="00:02:33.129" style="s2">had micro rivalry but created macro anti</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">fragility right so the like the earth as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.129" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">a entity that was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">a blossoming anti fragile symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">nature thing but we&#39;ve humans have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:47.490" style="s2">created this new process as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">abstraction and design and technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.490" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">and science and this kind of process it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">creates it has micro rivalry in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">sense of like market competition but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have macro antifragility right</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:00.570" style="s2">we don&#39;t have if you look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">today or something like the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.570" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">Revolution Industrial Revolution was</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:07.250" style="s2">created by a process and that process</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a built into that process</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.250" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">is not something that says hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">internalize our externalities or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">you know let&#39;s close these loops and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">instead we get something like climate</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">change and so these this process tack is</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">a process gives us these multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">traps with this exponential tech that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">will produce these exponentially harmful</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:30.540" style="s2">externalities eventually and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">the world that we live in and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.540" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">switch away we essentially need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">create a new kind of process design a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">new kind of process that kind of takes</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">the best of both worlds here where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:43.860" style="s2">have where we create macro</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:46.500" style="s2">anti-fertility but it&#39;s not created as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.860" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">an emergent process of evolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">micro rivalry but instead is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">kind of by design by by us as humans so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">that&#39;s primarily what we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">today and just as a quick note you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">we put a lot of context before this so</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely juicy in the first 30</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">minutes but it gets especially juicy in</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">the last 30 minutes or we go deep on</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:10.570" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:13.010" style="s2">so with that hope you enjoy the episode</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:24.600" style="s2">world we have a couple different series</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.100" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">to focus on different system scopes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.600" end="00:04:28.290" style="s2">today we&#39;re focusing on series a macro</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">systems where he asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.290" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">where are we as humanity headed and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:35.130" style="s2">dive into that question I&#39;m very happy</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">to introduce Danish Mactan Berger to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.130" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">this show Daniel loves exploring various</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:40.620" style="s2">topics of civilizational significance</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">trying to shake them for good and he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:45.390" style="s2">I know and much of my own thinking has</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">been shaped by him so Daniel thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.390" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">being on the show and welcome my friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:52.290" style="s2">me too okay so we&#39;re really gonna push</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">the question where are we as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.290" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">headed today and let&#39;s gonna start at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.460" style="s2">the top here and before talking kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:01.260" style="s2">too deeply about our current context or</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.460" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">what&#39;s happening Daniel how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">about kind of goals like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:05.820" style="s2">think about goals for our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">or when you&#39;re trying to like you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.820" end="00:05:11.180" style="s2">optimize for a metric or something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:15.210" style="s2">that what are your big goals mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.180" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">before talking about what I think good</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.210" end="00:05:20.340" style="s2">goals would be I think the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:22.500" style="s2">you&#39;re actually asking about is is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.340" end="00:05:25.170" style="s2">goal-oriented framework actually a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.500" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">adequate or good framework or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.170" end="00:05:31.170" style="s2">other frameworks we want to take and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:33.630" style="s2">obviously Western culture has been and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.170" end="00:05:36.390" style="s2">particularly industrial post scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.630" end="00:05:39.510" style="s2">technological and even computational</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.390" end="00:05:42.750" style="s2">culture has been very oriented to goals</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.510" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">kind of process and we can attribute</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.750" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">both lots of successes and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">failures of the world or many of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:52.170" style="s2">failures of the world to that process</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">because if I define a goal and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.170" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include everything that will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">affected by the nature of what I do to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">get there then whatever is affected that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:02.040" style="s2">I didn&#39;t define as part of my goal as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:06.350" style="s2">the space where externalities can happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.040" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">and even in the you know very</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.350" end="00:06:12.540" style="s2">well-intentioned nonprofit you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2">whatever kinds of sectors we see all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.540" end="00:06:18.230" style="s2">time having things like okay so we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">a goal to end extreme poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.230" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">childhood hunger globally or within a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.240" end="00:06:24.600" style="s2">particular area that seems like a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:25.470" style="s2">awesome goal as well she&#39;s ever seen the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.600" end="00:06:27.960" style="s2">child who&#39;s hungry or</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.470" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">mother watching her child be hungry the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.960" end="00:06:33.690" style="s2">tricky thing is if my only goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:35.630" style="s2">end hunger I can do it through Unruh</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.690" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">noble agricultural methods that dump</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.630" end="00:06:41.510" style="s2">nitrogen into the river deltas removing</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:45.390" style="s2">dead zones in the ocean even faster</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.510" end="00:06:47.310" style="s2">moving us towards actually extinction as</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.390" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">a species and collapse of the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.310" end="00:06:52.530" style="s2">writ large which is okay so we prevented</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.270" end="00:06:53.790" style="s2">some people from dying over the very</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.530" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">short term and made it more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:06:59.640" style="s2">everyone dies with medium term yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:01.380" style="s2">at minimum when we think about goals we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.640" end="00:07:03.090" style="s2">could at least just start by this hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.380" end="00:07:06.990" style="s2">waving kind of thing of saying our goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.090" end="00:07:09.780" style="s2">is X whatever X is right stop extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.990" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">poverty and just add this little caveat</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.780" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">which is our goal is to do that and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:20.100" style="s2">externalize harm to anything else that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">matters and now when you start exploring</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.100" end="00:07:24.150" style="s2">how do I know what else might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">affected that could have harm</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:30.180" style="s2">externalize that isn&#39;t obvious in very</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:33.960" style="s2">complex systems and with technology that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.180" end="00:07:35.700" style="s2">has lots of different causal dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">that are associated and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.700" end="00:07:40.740" style="s2">question of what are other things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:42.540" style="s2">matter and what is my ethical and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.740" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">existential framework for assessing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.540" end="00:07:48.810" style="s2">then you start to realize that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:50.729" style="s2">of hand wave leads it way to a much</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.810" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">deeper process of what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.729" end="00:07:55.620" style="s2">omni consideration yeah let me pause you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:56.790" style="s2">for a second actually there because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:07:59.669" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a lot of good juicy</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.790" end="00:08:01.530" style="s2">stuff a as you said we&#39;re kind of so</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.669" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">used to thinking of this goal framework</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.530" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost it&#39;s hard to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:07.950" style="s2">it in some ways and like you say I super</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">girth you say once we create a goal</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.950" end="00:08:11.970" style="s2">whatever that goal is X and you also say</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:13.410" style="s2">what are all the externalities of X and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.970" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">how can we make sure that we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.410" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">minimizing the negative externalities</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">and upping the positive externalities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:22.200" style="s2">that X is there I guess to go a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:24.120" style="s2">bit deeper on that this kind of goals</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.200" end="00:08:25.830" style="s2">perspective and you kind of start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.120" end="00:08:28.350" style="s2">allude to the stomach&#39;s is like there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.830" end="00:08:30.150" style="s2">are there are people in the world so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.350" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">would say I&#39;m like a relative kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:35.400" style="s2">effective altruism list in terms of I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:36.839" style="s2">agree with you know generally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.400" end="00:08:39.350" style="s2">like consequentialism and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.839" end="00:08:40.760" style="s2">outcome-focused ends focused mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.350" end="00:08:42.740" style="s2">those are all kind of goal they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.760" end="00:08:43.640" style="s2">kind of goals as a part of them so how</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.740" end="00:08:46.280" style="s2">do you think about something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:47.840" style="s2">effective altruism as kind of a mostly a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.280" end="00:08:50.360" style="s2">goal focused or kind of an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.840" end="00:08:51.980" style="s2">focused mindset is that going to be is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.360" end="00:08:58.010" style="s2">that good for shaping the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.980" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">positively effective altruism is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.010" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">valuable step in the consideration</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">process of saying if we really care</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">about having actions that have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:13.340" style="s2">positive impact on life at large how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:15.350" style="s2">we go about influencing our choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.340" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">making basis of what will be effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.350" end="00:09:23.000" style="s2">and how can we use very effective tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:25.640" style="s2">like rationality to inform better choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.000" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">so insofar as it&#39;s asking what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.640" end="00:09:32.540" style="s2">right epistemic frameworks to inform</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:34.940" style="s2">good choice that&#39;s a great step now of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.540" end="00:09:38.740" style="s2">course I&#39;m going to say that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.940" end="00:09:44.060" style="s2">limited step and the limits are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.740" end="00:09:45.260" style="s2">fatal and the direction and permeate</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.060" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">rates have to happen so here&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.260" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">examples when we talk about the limits</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.020" end="00:09:53.330" style="s2">of goals because the goal is always</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:55.790" style="s2">embedded within a larger context and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.330" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">you have to factor it&#39;s in the embedding</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.790" end="00:10:00.440" style="s2">functions and that&#39;s where the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">externality comes and how even think</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.440" end="00:10:04.970" style="s2">through externality we&#39;re mostly only</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">going to forecast within domains that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.970" end="00:10:08.690" style="s2">already know a lot so as we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:10.460" style="s2">into exponential technology where there</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.690" end="00:10:15.020" style="s2">are faster rates of change more</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.460" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">complicated more complex systems etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.020" end="00:10:19.870" style="s2">then there&#39;s more stuff that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:22.550" style="s2">happen that we don&#39;t forecast well and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.870" end="00:10:24.500" style="s2">faster coupling from the micro context</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.550" end="00:10:26.120" style="s2">to the macro context it used to be that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.500" end="00:10:28.550" style="s2">whatever happened in a microwave wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.120" end="00:10:30.440" style="s2">going to affect the biosphere or human</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.550" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">civilization at large because stone</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.440" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">tools just don&#39;t have as big a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.820" end="00:10:38.300" style="s2">consequence as AI or nanotech biotech do</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:40.790" style="s2">and so because of the larger scale and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.300" end="00:10:43.150" style="s2">faster timeline coupling coefficients of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.790" end="00:10:45.170" style="s2">micro action to macro dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.150" end="00:10:46.790" style="s2">externality is that much bigger of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.170" end="00:10:48.350" style="s2">topic right and it&#39;s an exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.790" end="00:10:50.270" style="s2">bigger topic so let&#39;s just take small</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.350" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">cases and didn&#39;t look at what happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.270" end="00:10:53.089" style="s2">when you put that on an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:55.639" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.089" end="00:10:57.199" style="s2">so say we take medicine because in</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.639" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">medicine we&#39;re talking about what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.199" end="00:11:01.759" style="s2">health and but in a body that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:03.739" style="s2">complex system but we take a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.759" end="00:11:05.659" style="s2">approach of trying to define health in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.739" end="00:11:09.379" style="s2">terms of a finite number of metrics so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.659" end="00:11:11.029" style="s2">we&#39;re going to look at your low density</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.379" end="00:11:12.589" style="s2">lipoprotein and your high density</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.029" end="00:11:14.179" style="s2">lipoprotein and a couple different</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.589" end="00:11:16.219" style="s2">cholesterol metrics and blood pressure</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.179" end="00:11:17.689" style="s2">and blood sugar and whatever in and as</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.219" end="00:11:19.189" style="s2">time goes on we look at more and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.689" end="00:11:20.629" style="s2">metrics but then the idea is that there</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.189" end="00:11:24.649" style="s2">is a range in which we want to see those</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.629" end="00:11:26.509" style="s2">metrics and so then the goal is at first</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.649" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">we can just say okay your cholesterol is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.509" end="00:11:30.739" style="s2">too high our goal is to lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:32.599" style="s2">cholesterol that seems like a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.739" end="00:11:34.129" style="s2">thing if I have a reason to think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.599" end="00:11:36.769" style="s2">high cholesterol increases the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.129" end="00:11:38.149" style="s2">probability for certain diseases but now</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.769" end="00:11:39.649" style="s2">I have to dig a little bit deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.149" end="00:11:41.179" style="s2">this first step is obvious the second</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.649" end="00:11:44.179" style="s2">step is more important the first step</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.179" end="00:11:46.609" style="s2">says okay when I say cholesterol is high</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.179" end="00:11:48.499" style="s2">so I want to lower it giving a statin</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.609" end="00:11:50.719" style="s2">drug actually works it makes sense I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.499" end="00:11:53.059" style="s2">gonna lower low-density lipoprotein I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.719" end="00:11:55.819" style="s2">did not ask why the cholesterol was high</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.059" end="00:11:59.269" style="s2">in the first place is that possibly a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.819" end="00:12:01.159" style="s2">protective mechanism to the arterial</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.269" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">system from some type of oxidative</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.159" end="00:12:05.269" style="s2">damage or toxicological damage or</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:07.309" style="s2">whatever that that&#39;s arising from is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.269" end="00:12:08.809" style="s2">that a sign of other systems homeo</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.309" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">dynamic systems being out of balance</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.809" end="00:12:13.249" style="s2">we&#39;re just addressing that symptom means</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:16.069" style="s2">underlying other patho ideology will</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.249" end="00:12:19.099" style="s2">continue is there a side effect on</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.069" end="00:12:20.629" style="s2">metrics other than LDL and maybe ones</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.099" end="00:12:22.909" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t even measured and done</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.629" end="00:12:25.219" style="s2">longer-term analysis on of the method</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.909" end="00:12:27.169" style="s2">that we&#39;re using etc so then we can say</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.219" end="00:12:29.629" style="s2">well the statin works for that but not</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.169" end="00:12:31.219" style="s2">how the system is more dependent on it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.629" end="00:12:33.079" style="s2">its own ability rated cholesterol is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.219" end="00:12:35.389" style="s2">less good why it was off we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.079" end="00:12:36.829" style="s2">know and the side effects of the statin</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.389" end="00:12:38.479" style="s2">might be things like liver toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.829" end="00:12:40.999" style="s2">brain toxicities and we say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.479" end="00:12:42.529" style="s2">that&#39;s not the best method but that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.999" end="00:12:44.209" style="s2">still our method right that&#39;s how we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.529" end="00:12:46.459" style="s2">medicine and that&#39;s why if you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.209" end="00:12:48.559" style="s2">about medicine we have really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.459" end="00:12:51.589" style="s2">acute medicine and really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.559" end="00:12:53.869" style="s2">chronic medicine so in acute medicine</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.589" end="00:12:58.359" style="s2">meaning if we know the acute onset of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.869" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">the illness like you just got shot and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.359" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">the problem is a bullet that went in we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:05.599" style="s2">can take the bullet out sew it up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.710" style="s2">there isn&#39;t deeper underline more</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.599" end="00:13:07.820" style="s2">complex causation</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.710" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">pretty straightforward and we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.820" end="00:13:11.870" style="s2">good at that you just got an acute</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">infection you just got an acute</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.870" end="00:13:15.020" style="s2">poisoning we can deal with those things</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:17.690" style="s2">pretty well but when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.020" end="00:13:19.850" style="s2">psychiatric disease or autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.690" end="00:13:22.310" style="s2">disease or neurodegenerative disease or</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.850" end="00:13:25.250" style="s2">cancer or anything that doesn&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.310" end="00:13:26.930" style="s2">obvious immediate cause you&#39;ll notice</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.250" end="00:13:28.760" style="s2">that for the most part we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.930" end="00:13:31.880" style="s2">anything that actually looks like a real</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.760" end="00:13:33.530" style="s2">cure or prevention we have symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.880" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">treatment and we might have things at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.530" end="00:13:38.390" style="s2">slow rates of progression and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">we don&#39;t and so you can&#39;t there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.390" end="00:13:42.470" style="s2">classic example we can cut it a cancer</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:43.880" style="s2">that we can radiate it out we can poison</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.470" end="00:13:45.770" style="s2">to help but we&#39;re not that good at</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.880" end="00:13:47.990" style="s2">saying why is it growing in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.770" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t when the person was younger</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.990" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">and that it doesn&#39;t and other people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">how do we actually address that because</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have one cause it has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:57.320" style="s2">bunch of different causes and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:13:58.850" style="s2">not even the same set of causes in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.320" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">different people so now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.850" end="00:14:05.090" style="s2">actually not do a generalized bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.540" end="00:14:07.370" style="s2">approach but do a let&#39;s understand this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.090" end="00:14:09.470" style="s2">complex system uniquely factoring</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.370" end="00:14:11.690" style="s2">multifactorial causation delayed</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.470" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">causation causal Cascades should that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.690" end="00:14:16.490" style="s2">are epistemic Limon that good at we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:19.810" style="s2">the same thing for the world when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.490" end="00:14:22.340" style="s2">saying we want to feed kids in this area</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.810" end="00:14:24.500" style="s2">and we&#39;re not saying what is wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.340" end="00:14:30.260" style="s2">the macroeconomy that actually creates</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.500" end="00:14:32.210" style="s2">poverty and what you know etc like what</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.260" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">are the actual causes of this problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.210" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">and then of a particular solution that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:38.660" style="s2">we&#39;re going to come up with it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:39.650" style="s2">address the causal dynamics well what</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.660" end="00:14:41.300" style="s2">are the side effects of that solution</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.650" end="00:14:43.400" style="s2">going to be is this Hagrid cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.300" end="00:14:45.080" style="s2">method going to lead to more nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.400" end="00:14:47.000" style="s2">runoff leading to larger dead zones in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.080" end="00:14:50.330" style="s2">the ocean that is actually worse for</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.000" end="00:14:52.850" style="s2">everyone long term and writ large and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.330" end="00:14:54.530" style="s2">what we find is then we look at the LDL</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.850" end="00:14:57.110" style="s2">and say okay so we want to look at LDL</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.530" end="00:14:59.150" style="s2">and these liver enzymes and a few other</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.110" end="00:15:01.730" style="s2">things and then we try and put more</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.150" end="00:15:04.270" style="s2">metrics and run optimization on those</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.730" end="00:15:08.450" style="s2">metrics which didn&#39;t we say big data and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.270" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">and machine learning will help us do but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.450" end="00:15:14.360" style="s2">this is the kind of the key thing no</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.740" style="s2">matter how many metrics there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.360" end="00:15:17.210" style="s2">things here when we say that goals are</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.740" end="00:15:20.220" style="s2">limited we also are saying that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.210" end="00:15:22.860" style="s2">optimization theory is limited</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.220" end="00:15:25.500" style="s2">for a couple critical reasons so now I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:30.329" style="s2">go from two metrics to 200 or 2000</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.500" end="00:15:32.220" style="s2">metrics but there&#39;s still other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.329" end="00:15:33.990" style="s2">that are happening that are outside of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.220" end="00:15:37.139" style="s2">the metrics that I&#39;m seeking to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.990" end="00:15:39.060" style="s2">that are mostly in either the beyond</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.139" end="00:15:40.980" style="s2">factorable within this model or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.060" end="00:15:43.740" style="s2">actual unknown unknowns but that might</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.980" end="00:15:45.569" style="s2">be critical to the whole system and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.740" end="00:15:46.680" style="s2">when I&#39;m running optimization on these</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.569" end="00:15:49.079" style="s2">end metrics</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.680" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">I&#39;m also affecting a lot of other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.079" end="00:15:51.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:54.360" style="s2">optimize which is this places where I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.870" end="00:15:55.560" style="s2">probably externalize harm is I&#39;m driving</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.360" end="00:15:56.819" style="s2">a system where all those things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.560" end="00:15:57.959" style="s2">interconnected without actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.819" end="00:16:00.689" style="s2">acknowledging they&#39;re in the correct and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.959" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">infected in other words our model of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.689" end="00:16:05.100" style="s2">complex system is not how the complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:07.110" style="s2">system actually works so when we treat</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.100" end="00:16:08.790" style="s2">the actual reality as the model and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.110" end="00:16:10.529" style="s2">try and optimize for the model the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.790" end="00:16:13.560" style="s2">in which the reality is not the model</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.529" end="00:16:16.050" style="s2">gets up and so when you define a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.560" end="00:16:18.209" style="s2">complex system as something that has an</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.050" end="00:16:19.829" style="s2">emergent property beyond how you model</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.209" end="00:16:22.439" style="s2">it when you model it you get certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.829" end="00:16:25.769" style="s2">system dynamics awesome complicated</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.439" end="00:16:27.689" style="s2">system complex system is the predicted</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.769" end="00:16:29.370" style="s2">dynamics of the model don&#39;t explain all</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.689" end="00:16:31.290" style="s2">of the dynamics then you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.370" end="00:16:32.850" style="s2">it&#39;s very different epistemology other</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.290" end="00:16:34.860" style="s2">than n-dimensional metrics an</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.850" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">optimization theory to account for what</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.860" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">is actually going on so pause for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:41.939" style="s2">second so I agree with a lot of that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">I want to talk about this sec but so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.939" end="00:16:45.899" style="s2">talked about the I agree there&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">forecasting piece or we live in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.899" end="00:16:50.670" style="s2">world where we have Black Swan style</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:53.459" style="s2">events and over hyper interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.670" end="00:16:55.259" style="s2">lots of power dynamics of external or</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.459" end="00:16:58.500" style="s2">lots of sorry Exponential&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.259" end="00:17:00.509" style="s2">and when all that happens if we set our</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.500" end="00:17:03.209" style="s2">goals and then don&#39;t account for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.509" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">externalities or actions then the sad</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.209" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">externalities can turn out to be really</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">big because everything&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:08.970" style="s2">interconnected and powerful now and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:10.169" style="s2">agree with what you&#39;re saying when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.970" end="00:17:12.030" style="s2">think about any of these actions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.169" end="00:17:13.319" style="s2">this gets into how kind of to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.030" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">about this stuff is like when you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.319" end="00:17:18.360" style="s2">about taking an action before you do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">think hey why is there this problem in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.360" end="00:17:21.209" style="s2">the first place to try to go to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:22.669" style="s2">root cause level and then B what are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.209" end="00:17:25.650" style="s2">externalities of that action</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.669" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">so in this final piece which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.650" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">getting to here&#39;s this map is not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:31.530" style="s2">territory thing here and it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">true for complex systems and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.530" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">kind of want to recap</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">that&#39;s tougher listener and then have</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:39.020" style="s2">you go and say okay so if we can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">this if I can&#39;t just keep adding metrics</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.020" end="00:17:41.419" style="s2">to MySpace</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.860" end="00:17:42.919" style="s2">is there an AK what is the new</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.419" end="00:17:44.330" style="s2">epistemology that I should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.919" end="00:17:46.370" style="s2">about that will actually allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.330" end="00:17:49.010" style="s2">allow us to to succeed in this new world</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.370" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">right so I want to share another</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.010" end="00:17:55.250" style="s2">framework that will help the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:56.990" style="s2">consideration here and this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.250" end="00:17:59.330" style="s2">happy thought at first but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.990" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">necessary thought which leads us to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.330" end="00:18:05.169" style="s2">more effective in considering how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">have happy thoughts around this so it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.169" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">that it is a lot easier to break</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:17.900" style="s2">than it is to actually protect or build</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">stuff and there is a entropic preference</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.900" end="00:18:22.460" style="s2">that we have to consider and just to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:24.950" style="s2">have a very simple kind of prima facie</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.460" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">of that the house that I&#39;m in probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.950" end="00:18:31.850" style="s2">took a year to build and the record ball</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">can take it down in minutes and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.850" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">think about an old-growth forest and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:37.640" style="s2">thousands of years it takes to get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.860" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">biodiversity and complexity of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.640" end="00:18:42.140" style="s2">forest and how long it takes with a fire</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:43.970" style="s2">or a d9 that take it down you really get</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.140" end="00:18:46.760" style="s2">a sense of the orders of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.970" end="00:18:48.919" style="s2">the timelines for construction versus</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.760" end="00:18:54.350" style="s2">destruction of complicated or complex</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.919" end="00:18:55.850" style="s2">systems and everything from from things</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.350" end="00:18:58.070" style="s2">like that how long does it take to build</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.850" end="00:19:00.470" style="s2">a globalized infrastructure and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.070" end="00:19:01.850" style="s2">quickly could we actually break it all</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.470" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">the way to how long does it take to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.850" end="00:19:06.380" style="s2">build trust and how easy is it to break</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">it and so when you factor that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.380" end="00:19:11.000" style="s2">realize that there&#39;s a couple orders of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:13.669" style="s2">magnitude more ways to break stuff than</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.000" end="00:19:16.190" style="s2">to build it in faster time processes on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.669" end="00:19:17.450" style="s2">that so when I&#39;m factoring externalities</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.190" end="00:19:19.450" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking about some new</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.450" end="00:19:22.669" style="s2">technological capacity and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.450" end="00:19:24.260" style="s2">understand actually forecast the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.669" end="00:19:26.120" style="s2">possible externalities well because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.260" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">don&#39;t even know that space I&#39;m opening</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.120" end="00:19:29.750" style="s2">up a new epistemic space with new types</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:31.730" style="s2">of causal dynamics and feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.750" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">and couplings that are very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.730" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">think about and there&#39;s an orientation</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.790" style="s2">that there will be more total ways of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">having destructive effects than</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.790" end="00:19:42.590" style="s2">constructive and that they will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:45.650" style="s2">faster this is something we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.590" end="00:19:46.250" style="s2">consider very deeply and when you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.650" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.250" end="00:19:53.450" style="s2">when we first got stone tools down we</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:55.669" style="s2">killed a lot of things faster than we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.450" end="00:19:57.970" style="s2">ever had before and we started the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.669" end="00:20:00.049" style="s2">beginning process of species extinction</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.970" end="00:20:01.820" style="s2">human induced species extinction when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.049" end="00:20:03.590" style="s2">first started kind of figuring out fire</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.820" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">we burned a lot of down before we</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.590" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">got good at containing fire but when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:14.450" style="s2">move up to AI and nanotech and biotech</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.789" style="s2">and things that are pattern replicating</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.450" end="00:20:19.159" style="s2">Tec meaning that the failure of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.789" end="00:20:21.320" style="s2">thing is not just that it caused a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.159" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">problem but that it causes a cascading</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.320" end="00:20:25.940" style="s2">problem that once initiated might not be</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:29.059" style="s2">stoppable you really have to change the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.940" end="00:20:31.010" style="s2">epistemic framework of good things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.059" end="00:20:33.470" style="s2">mostly good progress at all costs</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.010" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">history is written by the winners we</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.470" end="00:20:37.970" style="s2">kind of ignore the ugly parts and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:39.799" style="s2">keep pushing and focusing on the good</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.970" end="00:20:42.020" style="s2">side of technology for some very limited</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.799" end="00:20:44.840" style="s2">definition of good because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.020" end="00:20:46.789" style="s2">destructive applications at that scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.840" end="00:20:48.350" style="s2">are large enough to actually destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.789" end="00:20:50.179" style="s2">entire playing field where the positive</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.350" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">applications just don&#39;t actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.179" end="00:20:56.150" style="s2">matter anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.220" end="00:20:58.610" style="s2">so there&#39;s an increasing kind of AD</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.150" end="00:21:00.919" style="s2">exponential scale Oh exponential</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.610" end="00:21:02.809" style="s2">constructive and destructive forces both</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.919" end="00:21:04.190" style="s2">the destructive forces become larger</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.809" end="00:21:06.650" style="s2">than the playing field can handle in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.190" end="00:21:09.380" style="s2">game in so with exponential tech you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.650" end="00:21:11.270" style="s2">either figure out how to prevent and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.380" end="00:21:13.490" style="s2">internalize externalities or the game</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.270" end="00:21:16.340" style="s2">eventually self self terminates and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.490" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">though the type of process that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.340" end="00:21:22.490" style="s2">used for all of history until now is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.020" end="00:21:23.510" style="s2">itself self terminating yep so could I</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.490" end="00:21:25.669" style="s2">you policy for saying they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.510" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of juicy stuff there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.669" end="00:21:30.679" style="s2">reminded of two leaves and an ear bar</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:32.890" style="s2">Yama&#39;s precautionary principle here</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.679" end="00:21:35.240" style="s2">which is the idea that even if something</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.890" end="00:21:37.429" style="s2">has you think it&#39;s gonna be really good</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.240" end="00:21:39.530" style="s2">with a 99% chance of being really good</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.429" end="00:21:42.350" style="s2">but it has a very very small percentage</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.530" end="00:21:43.669" style="s2">chance of like actual ruin or like</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.350" end="00:21:45.169" style="s2">existential risk then it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.669" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">then you shouldn&#39;t do it you know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.169" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">when we live in this world where</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">everything is interconnected and where</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">everything is becoming more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:53.990" style="s2">than that that lose side that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.179" style="s2">destructive side can become yet becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.990" end="00:21:58.230" style="s2">we have to change kind of our way is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.179" end="00:22:00.600" style="s2">given our exponential tech so let me</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.230" end="00:22:03.750" style="s2">you follow up on that for a quick second</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.600" end="00:22:05.250" style="s2">here which is if we&#39;re trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.750" end="00:22:07.559" style="s2">our ways here and we&#39;re trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.250" end="00:22:10.740" style="s2">kind of taken all the externalities into</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.559" end="00:22:16.200" style="s2">account how yeah how can we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.740" end="00:22:19.260" style="s2">start to do that mm-hmm so great</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.200" end="00:22:21.030" style="s2">question again I&#39;ll say one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.260" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">that I think read some of the context</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.030" end="00:22:26.429" style="s2">great one of the important things to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">consider when we think about the topic</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.429" end="00:22:30.360" style="s2">of negative externalities that so one</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.890" end="00:22:32.549" style="s2">thing we just said is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.360" end="00:22:34.530" style="s2">entropic gradient right so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.549" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">factor that another key thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.530" end="00:22:39.830" style="s2">topic of weaponization if I create a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">technology and it is the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.830" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">affect change through the causal lever</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.750" style="s2">on choice right and I&#39;m gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:50.669" style="s2">choice my technological understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.750" end="00:22:52.500" style="s2">some mechanism allowed me to make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.669" end="00:22:53.940" style="s2">technology that&#39;s a big lever on my</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.500" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">choice so my choice has bigger effect</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.940" end="00:22:59.309" style="s2">then did before well that same</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:02.190" style="s2">technological capacity can be a lever on</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.309" end="00:23:04.169" style="s2">lots of kinds of choices right and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.190" end="00:23:07.410" style="s2">one of the things we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.169" end="00:23:11.400" style="s2">is that the moment we actually deploy a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.410" end="00:23:14.940" style="s2">type of asymmetric technology then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.400" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">gets reverse engineered iterated upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.940" end="00:23:23.490" style="s2">and utilized for all purposes that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">incentivized by all agents and so I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.490" end="00:23:26.580" style="s2">just had some guys talk with me the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">other day about an AI project they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.580" end="00:23:31.290" style="s2">working on of how they could use some AI</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:33.780" style="s2">information technology that was novel</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.290" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">they just developed to get out some type</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.780" end="00:23:40.049" style="s2">of what they thought were positive</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.730" style="s2">political agendas to solve some current</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.049" end="00:23:43.830" style="s2">near-term problems and I&#39;m like and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.730" end="00:23:45.299" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the other side&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.830" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">have as much incentive and pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.299" end="00:23:49.650" style="s2">Intel will pay attention to the new</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:51.179" style="s2">technology you have reverse engineering</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.650" end="00:23:53.160" style="s2">and utilize it for the other purposes</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.179" end="00:23:54.809" style="s2">and simply and the and they thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.160" end="00:23:57.059" style="s2">about me like like I guess that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.809" end="00:23:59.400" style="s2">happen and I said now take all of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.059" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">sides in this multi agent dynamic that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.400" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">all have rival risks incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">weaponize the technology against each</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:09.480" style="s2">other for their agendas and all you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:12.050" style="s2">is up the ante of the playing field and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.480" end="00:24:13.640" style="s2">so nukes didn&#39;t actually make us safer</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.050" end="00:24:15.830" style="s2">like they made a safer but we actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.640" end="00:24:18.020" style="s2">have increased risk of existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.830" end="00:24:19.790" style="s2">from nuclear warfare relative to a world</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.020" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">that had just never developed nukes okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.790" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">and so this is the multipolar trap where</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:27.290" style="s2">each agent doing the thing that seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">like it provides and whether the agent</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.290" end="00:24:32.030" style="s2">is a person or a country or a company or</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:33.770" style="s2">whatever each agent doing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.030" end="00:24:35.780" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s best for what they care</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.770" end="00:24:38.090" style="s2">about in the near-term actually leads to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.780" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">a system disposition that is worse for</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.090" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">the system as a whole over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">and this is what we call a multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">track or a race to the bottom right a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons and arms race are</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:52.010" style="s2">all examples of this and with</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.920" end="00:25:02.180" style="s2">thing can say is in terms of goals or</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:11.000" style="s2">categorically for the class of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:13.370" style="s2">multipolar traps as long as you have a</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.910" end="00:25:21.230" style="s2">near-term incentive to do that and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:22.790" style="s2">have exponential tech and anytime anyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.230" end="00:25:25.930" style="s2">deploys that everyone will be using it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.790" end="00:25:29.450" style="s2">for rivals purposes we we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.930" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">completely yep yep so can i pause</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:32.930" style="s2">you for a second there on that great and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:34.460" style="s2">so i agree with this and this is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.930" end="00:25:36.920" style="s2">something that you call like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.460" end="00:25:38.600" style="s2">generator functions of x risk and these</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.920" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">are these these multipolar traps and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.600" end="00:25:41.690" style="s2">can look at it when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:43.550" style="s2">existential risks that exist today there</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.690" end="00:25:45.050" style="s2">are things like nuclear security and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.550" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">that&#39;s an arms race it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.050" end="00:25:48.380" style="s2">couldn&#39;t we have stopped at like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:50.300" style="s2">maybe like three nukes or something but</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">now we have thousands of nukes and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.300" end="00:25:53.570" style="s2">think about biotech again it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.620" end="00:25:54.860" style="s2">people doing things there in these</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.570" end="00:25:56.690" style="s2">win-lose game dynamics where if they</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.860" end="00:25:58.310" style="s2">stop and if they don&#39;t if they don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.690" end="00:25:59.800" style="s2">quicker and same with like artificial</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.310" end="00:26:02.990" style="s2">intelligence alignment it&#39;s like ooh</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.800" end="00:26:04.280" style="s2">maybe Google and Baidu and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.990" end="00:26:06.530" style="s2">Chinese government&#39;s new whoever are</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.280" end="00:26:07.970" style="s2">going to be nice around and be and try</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">to be safe but actually they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:11.620" style="s2">in this win lose game dynamic where if</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:14.030" style="s2">they&#39;re the first ones to get AGI then</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.620" end="00:26:16.670" style="s2">they will have lots of rewards and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.030" end="00:26:19.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a disincentive to kind of chill</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.670" end="00:26:20.330" style="s2">and wait for the safety things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.070" end="00:26:22.100" style="s2">something like climate change obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.330" end="00:26:23.510" style="s2">is a an example of the that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.100" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">perfect example the tragedy the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.510" end="00:26:25.740" style="s2">where you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:27.030" style="s2">it didn&#39;t matter that much at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.740" end="00:26:28.200" style="s2">beginning when we started the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.030" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">Revolution that we were pushing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.200" end="00:26:32.910" style="s2">into the atmosphere but as you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:34.770" style="s2">once it gets exponential then and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.910" end="00:26:36.179" style="s2">ignore that externality then we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.770" end="00:26:37.650" style="s2">one of these multiple traps or no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.179" end="00:26:39.870" style="s2">caring about the earth and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.650" end="00:26:41.580" style="s2">everybody gets screwed up so I agree</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.870" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">with all that I also agree with you and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.580" end="00:26:45.090" style="s2">saying this weaponization piece is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:46.350" style="s2">very interesting one it&#39;s and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.090" end="00:26:47.670" style="s2">it&#39;s weird mindset that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.350" end="00:26:50.070" style="s2">a little bit before with this weird kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.670" end="00:26:52.110" style="s2">of Omni considerate mindset where you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.070" end="00:26:53.610" style="s2">have to kind of this is both powerful</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.110" end="00:26:55.800" style="s2">from an individual perspective we tried</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.610" end="00:26:57.300" style="s2">like a steel man the other person but</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.800" end="00:26:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s also very powerful from this kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.300" end="00:27:02.040" style="s2">of systems perspective we say hey if I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.280" end="00:27:03.420" style="s2">do something and well maybe it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.040" end="00:27:05.790" style="s2">for me but what happens if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.420" end="00:27:07.650" style="s2">does that you know then is it still good</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.790" end="00:27:09.830" style="s2">and is the thing that I&#39;m using the tool</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.650" end="00:27:12.750" style="s2">and I just did a podcast on new power</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.830" end="00:27:14.520" style="s2">these kinds of new power are those tools</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.750" end="00:27:15.330" style="s2">and those kinds of powerful things how</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.520" end="00:27:17.880" style="s2">are they going to be used by</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.330" end="00:27:19.320" style="s2">quote-unquote the other side you need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.880" end="00:27:22.170" style="s2">think about that in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.320" end="00:27:24.750" style="s2">weaponization piece um so I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.170" end="00:27:26.280" style="s2">all of you here one thing that I might</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.750" end="00:27:28.530" style="s2">be worried about just as a heads up is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.280" end="00:27:30.059" style="s2">like this to some extent I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.530" end="00:27:32.190" style="s2">people might get stuck in a trap right</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.059" end="00:27:34.110" style="s2">now which is where I&#39;ll make maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.190" end="00:27:36.420" style="s2">a postmodernist trap where it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.110" end="00:27:38.160" style="s2">we had been in the the world of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.420" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">modernism we were excited by the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.160" end="00:27:40.770" style="s2">we said hey we&#39;re gonna be nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.690" end="00:27:42.630" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go go go and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.770" end="00:27:44.730" style="s2">post-modernism came around and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.630" end="00:27:46.679" style="s2">rejected those myths we said no nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.730" end="00:27:49.740" style="s2">can be real and like everything is kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.679" end="00:27:51.330" style="s2">of kind of gradients or whatever and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.740" end="00:27:52.620" style="s2">feels like it may be a similar thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.330" end="00:27:54.929" style="s2">here where you&#39;re like you say like oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.620" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">man Reese we need to think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.929" end="00:27:58.290" style="s2">externalities all the time or like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:00.990" style="s2">many consideration all time or like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.290" end="00:28:02.400" style="s2">can we how can we then make choices if</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.990" end="00:28:05.400" style="s2">we have to be worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.400" end="00:28:10.770" style="s2">externalities kind of of everything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.400" end="00:28:13.620" style="s2">great question and as you can guess and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.770" end="00:28:15.090" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to advocate is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.620" end="00:28:18.770" style="s2">adequate at the seeming and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.090" end="00:28:20.820" style="s2">framework is not post-modernism nice a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.770" end="00:28:25.830" style="s2">couple more parts that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.820" end="00:28:27.720" style="s2">construct in here is so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:29.700" style="s2">regarding weaponization and just a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.720" end="00:28:31.650" style="s2">simple practical thought for people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.700" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">are wanting to do good I was having this</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.650" end="00:28:38.029" style="s2">conversation with Tom Chi the other day</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:40.740" style="s2">and you know he&#39;s a really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.029" end="00:28:42.750" style="s2">prototyper inventor robot assess</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.740" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">technologists working on good things for</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.750" end="00:28:50.730" style="s2">the world and we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:52.970" style="s2">problem of organisation and cognizant of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.730" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">that his approach and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.970" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">approach that Bucky fuller laid out very</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:28:59.909" style="s2">clearly and and others have is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">take technology that already exists for</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.909" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">weaponized purposes and start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:05.850" style="s2">popularize how to use it for actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:07.950" style="s2">positive purposes so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.850" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2">increasing the technological power</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.950" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">landscape we&#39;re repurposing the shitty</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:15.029" style="s2">power to better power and so we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.260" end="00:29:16.470" style="s2">actually going to be driving a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.029" end="00:29:18.840" style="s2">multipolar trapping race to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.470" end="00:29:20.519" style="s2">we are within the current landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.840" end="00:29:22.169" style="s2">not having solved from multipolar traps</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.519" end="00:29:24.809" style="s2">categorically yet we&#39;re at least driving</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.169" end="00:29:26.580" style="s2">a race to the top and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.809" end="00:29:28.350" style="s2">really key idea so when he&#39;s looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.580" end="00:29:30.690" style="s2">how do we take drone tech that already</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.350" end="00:29:32.460" style="s2">exists for military purposes and sucks</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.690" end="00:29:34.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna make fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.460" end="00:29:37.139" style="s2">better weapon izybelle drone tech but</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.380" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use it to plant a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.139" end="00:29:41.909" style="s2">of trees to pull a bunch of co2 out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:45.029" style="s2">stabilize topsoil and other things you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.909" end="00:29:48.809" style="s2">have a much lower risk of weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.029" end="00:29:51.899" style="s2">in that approach and so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.809" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">offer that as one very simple kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.899" end="00:29:54.690" style="s2">strategy that people can think about now</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">that still doesn&#39;t mean that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.690" end="00:29:57.690" style="s2">particular approach won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:00.269" style="s2">externalities and doesn&#39;t think thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.690" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">about of course if I take a desertified</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.269" end="00:30:07.100" style="s2">area unplanned trees for the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:10.139" style="s2">sequester co2 and so I take whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.100" end="00:30:12.269" style="s2">genetically engineered plants the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.139" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">Questor co2 the fastest and just plant a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.269" end="00:30:16.440" style="s2"> ton of it I might get all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:19.169" style="s2">ecological problems as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.440" end="00:30:20.549" style="s2">anything from mono cropping to invasive</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.169" end="00:30:23.490" style="s2">species to whatever else right so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.549" end="00:30:24.919" style="s2">still have to think about complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.490" end="00:30:26.909" style="s2">I don&#39;t think about weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.919" end="00:30:28.970" style="s2">increasing the potential of the power</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.909" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">landscape as much so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.970" end="00:30:35.309" style="s2">consideration next I want to go onto</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.570" style="s2">something about multi polar traps but do</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.309" end="00:30:38.700" style="s2">you want to say anything on that purpose</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">oh no no no you go to multiple traps</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.700" end="00:30:45.149" style="s2">thank you for checking them so for</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:48.570" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.149" end="00:30:49.880" style="s2">topic well yet there&#39;s a article on</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.570" end="00:30:54.470" style="s2">Slate star codex</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.880" end="00:30:56.390" style="s2">meditations on Moloch articles on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.470" end="00:30:57.890" style="s2">whole site I think and one of the better</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.390" end="00:31:02.600" style="s2">introductions the concept of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.890" end="00:31:04.190" style="s2">chunks I will share and whether we get</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.600" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">to it on this podcast or another time a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.190" end="00:31:08.600" style="s2">different set of insights about a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">categorical solution to multipolar traps</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.600" end="00:31:13.130" style="s2">but just so that people understand them</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:16.700" style="s2">a little bit and why they are so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.130" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">get out of if we you mentioned a couple</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.700" end="00:31:20.059" style="s2">examples but I want to highlight the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:22.610" style="s2">system dynamics a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.059" end="00:31:25.309" style="s2">explicitly because as you said this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.610" end="00:31:28.820" style="s2">actually not the source of one X risk</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.309" end="00:31:31.370" style="s2">this is a generator function for all X</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.820" end="00:31:33.890" style="s2">risks because one things about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.370" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">if we don&#39;t resolve it categorically</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.890" end="00:31:39.559" style="s2">then we just kind of move the timescales</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:40.970" style="s2">a tiny bit so let&#39;s take a tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.559" end="00:31:42.740" style="s2">the Commons it started a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.970" end="00:31:45.380" style="s2">and we just say okay we got a number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.740" end="00:31:47.480" style="s2">tribes that are all seeking to increase</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.380" end="00:31:50.059" style="s2">their own well-being they are in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.480" end="00:31:52.309" style="s2">implicit competition with each other for</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.059" end="00:31:55.850" style="s2">the same scarce resources at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.309" end="00:31:58.520" style="s2">point that implicit competition economic</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.850" end="00:31:59.870" style="s2">resource extraction wise can become so</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.520" end="00:32:01.850" style="s2">problematic that they move into an</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.870" end="00:32:04.340" style="s2">explicit militaristic competition which</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.850" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2">we can see how it happened but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.340" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">just even start to take first okay I</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:10.580" style="s2">don&#39;t want to cut all the trees down</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.289" style="s2">because I actually really like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.580" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">forest I have a whole spirituality about</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.289" end="00:32:16.100" style="s2">our connection with nature and we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:17.720" style="s2">the force to live because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.100" end="00:32:19.400" style="s2">the animals live that we hunt and etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.720" end="00:32:21.830" style="s2">and I actually don&#39;t need that many</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.400" end="00:32:23.990" style="s2">trees I just need a few trees some only</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.830" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">in cut down those few trees except the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.990" end="00:32:26.900" style="s2">population of these other tribes and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:28.309" style="s2">total number of tribes has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.900" end="00:32:30.470" style="s2">increasing and they&#39;re all cutting down</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.309" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">trees and so I know that if I don&#39;t cut</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:33.710" style="s2">down the trees it still doesn&#39;t ensure</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:35.059" style="s2">that there&#39;s a forest because the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.710" end="00:32:36.470" style="s2">guys didn&#39;t cut down the trees so</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.059" end="00:32:38.690" style="s2">there&#39;s not gonna be a forest anyways</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.470" end="00:32:40.750" style="s2">but he&#39;s actually my competitor because</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.690" end="00:32:44.539" style="s2">he&#39;s going to use those for weapons</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.750" end="00:32:45.980" style="s2">weapon making that if I don&#39;t also do so</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.539" end="00:32:49.039" style="s2">he will actually end up killing my</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.980" end="00:32:50.600" style="s2">people or people be able to outlive us</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.039" end="00:32:52.789" style="s2">through a famine because of total amount</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.600" end="00:32:55.940" style="s2">of economic accumulation or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.789" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">is so since I can&#39;t actually keep the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.940" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">forest because of those guys and even if</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:00.919" style="s2">I tried to make a truce with this one</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:02.800" style="s2">tribe there&#39;s this other tribe that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.919" end="00:33:04.360" style="s2">just can&#39;t even talk to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.800" end="00:33:06.670" style="s2">so if anybody does the up thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.360" end="00:33:08.800" style="s2">of cutting down a bunch of trees then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.670" end="00:33:10.030" style="s2">are in a race to all get them first to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.800" end="00:33:11.860" style="s2">keep the other guy from having them</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.030" end="00:33:14.650" style="s2">because there is no incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:16.270" style="s2">leaving them and because then it&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.650" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">for us to have them so now we could have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.270" end="00:33:21.790" style="s2">done a lot more trees than we need and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">so but they only do that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.790" end="00:33:24.550" style="s2">thinking the same thing about us where</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:28.420" style="s2">the up other tribe to them right</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.550" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">and so now we all realize that we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.420" end="00:33:32.890" style="s2">to increase how good our axes and saws</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:34.510" style="s2">are and how many people are cutting down</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.890" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">forests to cut it down faster because</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.510" end="00:33:39.580" style="s2">we&#39;re all racing to get that wood or the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:42.520" style="s2">pigs or the whales or the farmland or</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.580" end="00:33:44.680" style="s2">whatever a dead trade and so now we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.520" end="00:33:48.010" style="s2">not just destroying the world upon which</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.680" end="00:33:51.790" style="s2">we depend we are in a race to destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.010" end="00:33:53.140" style="s2">as fast as possible and if we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.790" end="00:33:54.730" style="s2">assume it will still get destroyed and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.140" end="00:33:56.530" style="s2">it will be worse for us and we have no</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.730" end="00:33:59.350" style="s2">chance of winning right so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.530" end="00:34:01.660" style="s2">scenario where anyone does the up</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.350" end="00:34:04.660" style="s2">thing and it sets a precedent for</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.660" end="00:34:06.340" style="s2">everyone else to actually be better off</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.660" end="00:34:08.500" style="s2">near-term if they do the up thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.340" end="00:34:10.060" style="s2">even though it leads to everyone being</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.500" end="00:34:13.150" style="s2">worse off over the long term so we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.060" end="00:34:14.740" style="s2">a decoupling of the incentive of each</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.150" end="00:34:16.690" style="s2">agent from the well-being of the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.740" end="00:34:18.460" style="s2">agents in the comments and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.690" end="00:34:20.470" style="s2">because of the interdependency of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.460" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">commons we have a decoupling of our own</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.470" end="00:34:25.660" style="s2">short-term advantage with our own</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:27.550" style="s2">long-term well-being if I take the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.660" end="00:34:29.320" style="s2">of tragedy of the Commons we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.550" end="00:34:31.090" style="s2">recalcitrant and tricky those are if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.320" end="00:34:33.400" style="s2">take the case of an arms race we see the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:35.740" style="s2">same thing and the tricky part here is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.400" end="00:34:37.330" style="s2">we say ok we haven&#39;t succeeded with</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.740" end="00:34:38.770" style="s2">nuclear deep proliferation all that well</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.330" end="00:34:42.910" style="s2">all that we have is more and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.770" end="00:34:44.650" style="s2">countries having existential level power</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.910" end="00:34:46.570" style="s2">so we can&#39;t even have something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.650" end="00:34:49.840" style="s2">mutually assured destruction anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.570" end="00:34:52.600" style="s2">so an obviously exponential tech can</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.840" end="00:34:54.340" style="s2">make that non state level actors and not</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.600" end="00:34:57.580" style="s2">the increase of all types of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.340" end="00:35:01.150" style="s2">but now let&#39;s take a current example</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.580" end="00:35:04.750" style="s2">let&#39;s take AI weapons right weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.150" end="00:35:06.490" style="s2">drones etc there is no general in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.750" end="00:35:08.950" style="s2">world that wants to live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.490" end="00:35:11.350" style="s2">where those weapons are robic waitis yep</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.950" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">there&#39;s no military contractor military</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.350" end="00:35:14.530" style="s2">Hawk whatever who thinks that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:16.060" style="s2">a nicer world to live in everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.530" end="00:35:18.490" style="s2">knows that our chance of all being</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.060" end="00:35:20.770" style="s2">killed by had drones goes up if any of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.490" end="00:35:22.780" style="s2">us build the things and so it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:24.700" style="s2">a comprehensively worse world for all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.780" end="00:35:27.070" style="s2">us and our kids and our grandkids and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.700" end="00:35:29.590" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re all gonna build the Miss fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.070" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">as we can because the other guys</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.590" end="00:35:32.050" style="s2">going to build them and we say whoa okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:33.880" style="s2">no no we need to create an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.050" end="00:35:36.340" style="s2">their efforts being made to do this but</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.880" end="00:35:38.440" style="s2">all it has to happen is one guy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.340" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">one group doesn&#39;t join the agreement and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.440" end="00:35:41.110" style="s2">now we don&#39;t want them to get the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:43.630" style="s2">weaponized drones first so we got to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.110" end="00:35:44.860" style="s2">it or everybody joins the agreement but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.630" end="00:35:47.290" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty sure they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.860" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">defecting on it in secret right because</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.290" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">they would have all of the incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.690" style="s2">do so so they keep the agreement and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:54.700" style="s2">then in a black project they defect on</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.690" end="00:35:56.440" style="s2">the agreement while continuing to dis</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.700" end="00:35:57.820" style="s2">inform us that they&#39;re keeping it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.440" end="00:36:00.370" style="s2">because we think they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.820" end="00:36:01.870" style="s2">we&#39;re also keeping this inform them</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.370" end="00:36:04.120" style="s2">while trying to spy on the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.870" end="00:36:05.890" style="s2">dis informing us and now all of our</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.910" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">a little bit from an effective alterus</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.010" end="00:39:39.360" style="s2">perspective is is when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">these kind of I agree that if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.360" end="00:39:44.280" style="s2">solve multipolar traps in these</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:45.990" style="s2">generator functions of X risk then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.280" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">will self terminate I fully agree with</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.990" end="00:39:49.380" style="s2">that but the question is at what time</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">line and so you can imagine a world</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.380" end="00:39:54.180" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to solve these kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:55.500" style="s2">of we&#39;re at this super abstract kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.180" end="00:39:57.450" style="s2">meta level and trying to solve these</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.500" end="00:39:59.580" style="s2">kind of generator functions back X risk</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.450" end="00:40:01.170" style="s2">Wow oops one of the X risks actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.580" end="00:40:02.730" style="s2">killed us you know you can also imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.170" end="00:40:04.440" style="s2">vice versa where we only solve one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.730" end="00:40:06.060" style="s2">the X risks but then the generator</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.440" end="00:40:08.430" style="s2">functions kill us so how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.060" end="00:40:10.020" style="s2">about kind of the cost of delay there in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.430" end="00:40:15.900" style="s2">terms of like what stuff we should focus</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:17.700" style="s2">on at which time if you are focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.900" end="00:40:21.530" style="s2">winning at the game that is killing</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.700" end="00:40:24.840" style="s2">everything then you are asleep or insane</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.530" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">hi I kind of agree but I bet later let</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.840" end="00:40:27.840" style="s2">me pause let me let me let me push back</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:29.550" style="s2">on that for a second you can imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.840" end="00:40:31.650" style="s2">world in which let&#39;s say you and I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.550" end="00:40:32.670" style="s2">the ability to solve an existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.650" end="00:40:33.840" style="s2">let&#39;s say we could press a button and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.670" end="00:40:37.980" style="s2">climate change went away or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.840" end="00:40:39.840" style="s2">that because we or we could concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.980" end="00:40:41.700" style="s2">on solving the generator functions of X</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.840" end="00:40:42.990" style="s2">risk I could see some versions and work</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.700" end="00:40:44.670" style="s2">on that for like a longer time whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:47.490" style="s2">I could see a version of reality where</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.670" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">we were certain people try to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.490" end="00:40:52.490" style="s2">the X risk itself rather than the kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">of meta level generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.490" end="00:40:57.480" style="s2">we have to be focused on the generator</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">functions because otherwise not only if</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.480" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">we try and solve for a specific extras</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:03.060" style="s2">that is a result of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">system architectures and dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.060" end="00:41:06.930" style="s2">made that risk and lots of risks like it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">not only do we not solve the other cases</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.930" end="00:41:10.650" style="s2">but there is a decent chance that as</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve mentioned about goals before we</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.650" end="00:41:16.170" style="s2">actually solve it in a way that makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.660" end="00:41:19.110" style="s2">something else more likely and and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.170" end="00:41:20.580" style="s2">is why so when I said if we are trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.110" end="00:41:22.050" style="s2">to win at the game that is killing</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.580" end="00:41:23.550" style="s2">everything basically whenever I&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.050" end="00:41:24.870" style="s2">this games and we&#39;re a sleeper in same</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.550" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">thing we just either don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.870" end="00:41:31.020" style="s2">the phenomena or there or something else</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.180" end="00:41:32.760" style="s2">wrong then what we also realize is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.020" end="00:41:34.230" style="s2">trying to just keep addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.760" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">symptoms without addressing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.230" end="00:41:38.610" style="s2">causing them doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:41.250" style="s2">either and so then we have to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.610" end="00:41:42.810" style="s2">well at minimum I want to focus on one</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.250" end="00:41:45.450" style="s2">if I don&#39;t know how to solve</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.810" end="00:41:47.070" style="s2">the underlying generator functions I at</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.450" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">least want to make sure that the actions</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.070" end="00:41:50.610" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing to the degree that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:52.170" style="s2">are successful create precedence where</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.270" style="s2">a race to the top rather than the race</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.270" end="00:42:00.980" style="s2">I&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.370" end="00:42:03.870" style="s2">meaning I&#39;m creating dynamics where my</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.980" end="00:42:05.850" style="s2">ability to win is through better</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">figure out how to factory it eyes farms</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.730" end="00:42:19.560" style="s2">I can produce more meat per dollar and</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.020" end="00:42:37.230" style="s2">less ethically terrible let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.030" end="00:42:38.670" style="s2">something where to the degree we</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.230" end="00:42:40.740" style="s2">succeeded this and other people follow</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.980" end="00:42:47.820" style="s2">says within the kinds of systems we</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.870" end="00:42:49.020" style="s2">understand like capitalism we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.820" end="00:42:50.370" style="s2">to move system dynamics in the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.020" end="00:42:53.310" style="s2">direction so one of the things people</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.370" end="00:42:56.130" style="s2">want to really focus on is is the source</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.310" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">of differential value that they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.130" end="00:43:00.690" style="s2">to provide within any project within</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.250" style="s2">capitalism something that to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.690" end="00:43:03.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s successful and other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.250" end="00:43:04.950" style="s2">try to replicate it create system</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.870" end="00:43:06.110" style="s2">dynamics that move in the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.950" end="00:43:08.460" style="s2">direction versus wrong direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.110" end="00:43:10.620" style="s2">absolutely one way that people can think</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.460" end="00:43:12.990" style="s2">about within the current systems how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.620" end="00:43:14.250" style="s2">be in the right direction some people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.990" end="00:43:16.200" style="s2">will be focused on how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.250" end="00:43:18.540" style="s2">solve the underlying generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.200" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">and we spoke about the generator</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.540" end="00:43:24.210" style="s2">function from one perspective which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.520" end="00:43:27.030" style="s2">that rival risk dynamics cause harm and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.210" end="00:43:29.070" style="s2">the exponential rivalry causing</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.030" end="00:43:31.410" style="s2">exponential harm self terminates yep</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.070" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">there is another way of speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.410" end="00:43:35.670" style="s2">the generator function that is even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:37.650" style="s2">fundamental and abstract and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.670" end="00:43:39.660" style="s2">would be worth sharing that if because</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.650" end="00:43:41.430" style="s2">it speaks to what we have to change if</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.660" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">your app let&#39;s yeah so then actually I</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.430" end="00:43:44.520" style="s2">was about to go there cuz I try we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:46.140" style="s2">essentially we&#39;re we&#39;re operating at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.520" end="00:43:47.730" style="s2">level of what I would call meta X risk</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.140" end="00:43:49.110" style="s2">the generator functions of X risk we</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.730" end="00:43:51.510" style="s2">pushed down for a bit there to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.110" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">actual s X risks themselves and now</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.510" end="00:43:54.690" style="s2">let&#39;s go actually from one level of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:56.040" style="s2">abstraction further up so tell me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.690" end="00:43:57.390" style="s2">what is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.040" end="00:43:59.970" style="s2">is actually one level above these</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.390" end="00:44:01.650" style="s2">generator functions of X racing yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.970" end="00:44:03.330" style="s2">the one generator function we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.650" end="00:44:05.970" style="s2">about rival resetting image we got that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.330" end="00:44:07.590" style="s2">I want to give one other example of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.970" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">generator function and then we&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.590" end="00:44:13.530" style="s2">an even more abstract unifying framework</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:16.680" style="s2">when you mention hey let&#39;s say we solve</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.530" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">climate change is that adequate and is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.680" end="00:44:22.650" style="s2">it even an appropriate thing to do so so</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:26.460" style="s2">let&#39;s take an example where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.650" end="00:44:28.320" style="s2">focused on like increasing war through</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.460" end="00:44:29.880" style="s2">exponential tech weaponization or</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.320" end="00:44:34.500" style="s2">whatever but we&#39;ll focused on simply</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.880" end="00:44:37.170" style="s2">environmental collapse dynamics so when</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.500" end="00:44:39.180" style="s2">we look at environmental damage dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.170" end="00:44:42.690" style="s2">all the environmental damage that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.180" end="00:44:45.450" style="s2">look at can be thought of in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.690" end="00:44:48.750" style="s2">either depletion of under noble</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.450" end="00:44:50.430" style="s2">resources or accumulation of waste</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.750" end="00:44:54.450" style="s2">streams that aren&#39;t being processed in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.430" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">real time and so accumulation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.450" end="00:44:59.190" style="s2">depletion when we start to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.970" end="00:45:01.980" style="s2">example so I say okay accumulation right</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.190" end="00:45:04.350" style="s2">what we call toxicity whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.980" end="00:45:06.390" style="s2">talking about nitrogen runoff causing</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.350" end="00:45:09.270" style="s2">dead zones or the plastic in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.390" end="00:45:12.840" style="s2">or mercury in the water or in the air or</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.270" end="00:45:14.670" style="s2">uranium or carbon dioxide causing</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.840" end="00:45:17.850" style="s2">carbonic acid in ocean acidification or</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.670" end="00:45:21.720" style="s2">carbon dioxide in the air or any of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.850" end="00:45:23.910" style="s2">those right the the CFCs are HFCS that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.720" end="00:45:26.910" style="s2">were the ozone hole problem those are</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.910" end="00:45:28.650" style="s2">all special case examples of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.910" end="00:45:30.210" style="s2">of accumulation of something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.650" end="00:45:32.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a feedback loop that can</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.210" end="00:45:35.250" style="s2">process it in real time that has some</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.790" end="00:45:37.140" style="s2">externalize costs on the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.250" end="00:45:39.540" style="s2">antifragility of the ecosystem writ</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.140" end="00:45:40.620" style="s2">large if I try and focus on one of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.540" end="00:45:43.500" style="s2">and say hey I&#39;m just going to sequester</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.620" end="00:45:45.480" style="s2">a bunch of co2 but I&#39;m not stopping the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.500" end="00:45:47.100" style="s2">nitrogen runoff or the you know any of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.480" end="00:45:49.530" style="s2">those other ones the biodiversity loss</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.100" end="00:45:51.390" style="s2">or whatever then what we&#39;ll find as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.530" end="00:45:53.310" style="s2">move the curve a tiny bit but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.390" end="00:45:55.260" style="s2">addressed the fact that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.310" end="00:45:56.820" style="s2">many different metrics that are all</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.260" end="00:45:58.650" style="s2">moving to collapse from the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.820" end="00:46:01.320" style="s2">underlying dynamic similarly on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.650" end="00:46:03.360" style="s2">other side of depletion whether them</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.320" end="00:46:05.070" style="s2">talking about cutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.360" end="00:46:07.500" style="s2">old-growth forests or overfishing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.070" end="00:46:09.300" style="s2">ocean or species extinction of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.500" end="00:46:09.720" style="s2">biodiversity loss or peak nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.300" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">turkey</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.720" end="00:46:14.750" style="s2">for us or any of those things those are</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">all examples simile of unremovable</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.750" end="00:46:20.370" style="s2">resource utilization and an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.670" end="00:46:22.110" style="s2">curve on how that is happening so then</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.370" end="00:46:24.840" style="s2">we say let&#39;s put those both together and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.110" end="00:46:28.470" style="s2">we look at that in a natural ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.840" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">like a forest there is no Unruh knowable</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.470" end="00:46:31.980" style="s2">use of resource and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:33.690" style="s2">accumulated waste every new thing is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.980" end="00:46:35.100" style="s2">made from old things all the old things</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.690" end="00:46:37.560" style="s2">get turned into new things so you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.100" end="00:46:40.260" style="s2">comprehensive loop closure all the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.560" end="00:46:41.640" style="s2">are in closed loop atomic cycling so</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.260" end="00:46:44.280" style="s2">that the atoms from one thing when it</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.640" end="00:46:47.010" style="s2">dies become new things at the same speed</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.280" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">that things are dying that or train ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.010" end="00:46:52.860" style="s2">the antifragility of nature is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:55.500" style="s2">function of a few things but primarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.860" end="00:46:59.130" style="s2">for this example a function of closed</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.500" end="00:47:02.370" style="s2">loop dynamics the fragility of the human</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.130" end="00:47:05.750" style="s2">bill world is largely a function of open</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.370" end="00:47:08.250" style="s2">loop dynamics so when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.750" end="00:47:10.320" style="s2">depletion on one side and accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.250" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">on the other those are the two sides of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.320" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">a linear atomic economy or materials</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:20.910" style="s2">resource economy that we can say the</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.910" end="00:47:24.690" style="s2">rather than closed loop cycles or open</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.730" style="s2">loops and a network diagram is the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.690" end="00:47:27.960" style="s2">we define toxicity we&#39;re at large then</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.730" end="00:47:30.560" style="s2">we need to work on the generator</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.960" end="00:47:33.240" style="s2">function not of just this one specific</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.560" end="00:47:35.420" style="s2">accumulation or depletion issue but how</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.240" end="00:47:37.830" style="s2">do we have a process by which</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.420" end="00:47:39.450" style="s2">comprehensive loop closure is built into</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.830" end="00:47:43.910" style="s2">the choice making processes of all</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.450" end="00:47:46.260" style="s2">humans everywhere yep and as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.910" end="00:47:48.840" style="s2">start thinking about it that way not</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.260" end="00:47:51.590" style="s2">just like how could we do it somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.840" end="00:47:53.910" style="s2">but how do we create a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.590" end="00:47:55.260" style="s2">behavioral dynamics from incentive</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.910" end="00:47:56.850" style="s2">structures to collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.260" end="00:47:58.620" style="s2">structures are basically the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.850" end="00:48:00.840" style="s2">making and choice making dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.620" end="00:48:02.070" style="s2">lead to all agents thinking about and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.840" end="00:48:04.410" style="s2">working towards comprehensive loop</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.070" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">closure that is now at a meta level to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.410" end="00:48:09.060" style="s2">all of the specific instantiations so</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:11.100" style="s2">now we go one level deeper and we say we</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.060" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">talked about rival risk dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.100" end="00:48:15.570" style="s2">multiplied by exponential tech self</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:21.480" style="s2">terminates we also talked about linear</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.570" end="00:48:23.050" style="s2">flows open loop flows on a finite planet</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.480" end="00:48:25.450" style="s2">also in the bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.050" end="00:48:28.270" style="s2">dynamic there is something that unifies</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.450" end="00:48:31.030" style="s2">both of those so we can flip them meta</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.270" end="00:48:33.940" style="s2">meta ex risk yep and we noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.030" end="00:48:36.120" style="s2">both of these involve specifically human</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.940" end="00:48:42.220" style="s2">and human choice empowered by technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.120" end="00:48:46.780" style="s2">in relationship with some kind of world</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.220" end="00:48:48.430" style="s2">or Commons right and so if I look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.780" end="00:48:50.320" style="s2">rival risk dynamics if there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.430" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">exponential tech if we stayed with stone</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.320" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">tools we wouldn&#39;t really have any risk</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:56.350" style="s2">of self induced extinction we would just</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:57.730" style="s2">keep killing each other but we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.350" end="00:48:58.900" style="s2">kill everybody we couldn&#39;t have a war</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.730" end="00:49:00.520" style="s2">that killed everybody and we wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.900" end="00:49:03.880" style="s2">able to cut down all the treats right</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.520" end="00:49:08.320" style="s2">and so specifically it requires not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.880" end="00:49:11.710" style="s2">tech but ever-growing tech right tech</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.320" end="00:49:14.920" style="s2">feedback curves and similarly if our</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.710" end="00:49:16.600" style="s2">tools were limited to a size where like</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.920" end="00:49:18.730" style="s2">say we have just fishing lines not</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.600" end="00:49:20.790" style="s2">mile-long drift nets we wouldn&#39;t fish</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.730" end="00:49:24.040" style="s2">all the fish out of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.790" end="00:49:25.990" style="s2">but as soon as we&#39;ve got mile-long drift</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.040" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">nets and we&#39;ve got D nines taking down</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.990" end="00:49:29.860" style="s2">forests and slash-and-burn whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:32.260" style="s2">then again we start to see these</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.860" end="00:49:33.790" style="s2">fragility dynamics get larger than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.260" end="00:49:35.830" style="s2">playing field can handle because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.790" end="00:49:38.830" style="s2">got movements that are faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.830" end="00:49:40.660" style="s2">antifragility can process now we say why</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.830" end="00:49:41.770" style="s2">is that and here&#39;s the key insight for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.660" end="00:49:43.870" style="s2">all the people that are thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.770" end="00:49:46.360" style="s2">how can we use the technology to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.870" end="00:49:48.550" style="s2">the world better and use technology in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.360" end="00:49:50.620" style="s2">fundamentally evolutionary way and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.550" end="00:49:54.730" style="s2">fact that people might say well look</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.620" end="00:49:57.970" style="s2">nature&#39;s rival risks and so we take</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.730" end="00:50:00.220" style="s2">market dynamics as kind of an example of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.970" end="00:50:01.360" style="s2">a social darwinism of looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.220" end="00:50:04.210" style="s2">nature works and applying it to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.360" end="00:50:05.980" style="s2">ourselves and am I talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.210" end="00:50:09.910" style="s2">something that sounds like it is not how</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.980" end="00:50:11.650" style="s2">nature works well kind of yes and no and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.910" end="00:50:13.090" style="s2">but there&#39;s this is really really</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.650" end="00:50:14.500" style="s2">critical because this is one place where</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.090" end="00:50:15.760" style="s2">people think they&#39;re thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.500" end="00:50:23.530" style="s2">formal systems but they&#39;re the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.760" end="00:50:25.840" style="s2">formal systems in nature pre humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.530" end="00:50:30.310" style="s2">let&#39;s say pre Homo habilis in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.840" end="00:50:35.470" style="s2">development of evolving technology or</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.310" end="00:50:36.850" style="s2">developing technology we see micro</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.470" end="00:50:40.320" style="s2">rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.850" end="00:50:43.060" style="s2">meaning this lion and this gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.320" end="00:50:45.370" style="s2">obviously in the moment of the chase</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.060" end="00:50:46.840" style="s2">have a rival risk relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.370" end="00:50:48.580" style="s2">other the lion wants what the gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.840" end="00:50:50.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t wanna be the lion doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.580" end="00:50:53.110" style="s2">and they&#39;re kind of mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.010" end="00:50:54.540" style="s2">so cool we we have a rival risk dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.110" end="00:50:57.340" style="s2">they&#39;re at a micro level and yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.540" end="00:50:58.930" style="s2">gazelles as a whole species and lions as</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.340" end="00:51:01.900" style="s2">a whole species depend upon each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.930" end="00:51:04.540" style="s2">and if they if either one died the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.900" end="00:51:06.750" style="s2">one would probably go extinct and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.540" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">then we say how is it that in nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.750" end="00:51:13.510" style="s2">micro local rivalry leads to macro</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:14.830" style="s2">symbiosis and interdependence and is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.510" end="00:51:17.110" style="s2">the same in humans or not because</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.830" end="00:51:18.850" style="s2">obviously social Darwinism and lazier</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.110" end="00:51:20.500" style="s2">capitalism says yes it is the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.850" end="00:51:22.180" style="s2">compete and the best happens and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.500" end="00:51:23.860" style="s2">innovate and those who produce the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.180" end="00:51:25.480" style="s2">goods and services and the best values</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.860" end="00:51:27.640" style="s2">and proliferate and have the most money</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.480" end="00:51:29.500" style="s2">because money is a concentrated form of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.640" end="00:51:30.730" style="s2">choice making but they they did the good</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.500" end="00:51:32.770" style="s2">things with joy so they should have more</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.730" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">choice name ID that&#39;s the idea right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.770" end="00:51:38.650" style="s2">it is gibberish and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:44.700" style="s2">understand really critically why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.650" end="00:51:48.010" style="s2">gibberish as soon as we developed</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.700" end="00:51:49.600" style="s2">technology and I&#39;m going to define what</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.010" end="00:51:51.880" style="s2">I mean by this very specifically in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.600" end="00:51:54.130" style="s2">moment we change the fundamental system</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.880" end="00:51:57.130" style="s2">dynamics and the same system dynamics do</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.130" end="00:51:59.950" style="s2">not and can not apply so let&#39;s go to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.130" end="00:52:02.380" style="s2">chimpanzee who obviously uses tools or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.950" end="00:52:04.690" style="s2">bird with a nest or a beaver or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.380" end="00:52:06.940" style="s2">right like they are tool users if I give</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.690" end="00:52:09.340" style="s2">a chimpanzee or if a chimpanzee just</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:12.820" style="s2">finds on its own a rock and it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.340" end="00:52:14.370" style="s2">cut some vine and it just starts rubbing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.820" end="00:52:16.900" style="s2">the rock across the vine it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.370" end="00:52:19.590" style="s2">experientially notices how good this</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.900" end="00:52:23.380" style="s2">particular rock is at cutting it has a</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.590" end="00:52:25.480" style="s2">eminent experience of that if it picks</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.380" end="00:52:27.400" style="s2">up another rock and they experience it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.480" end="00:52:30.460" style="s2">cutting faster they will use the sharper</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.400" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">rock if you give them a knife they will</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.460" end="00:52:33.460" style="s2">experience a cutting posture and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:35.970" style="s2">will use the knife but they have never</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.460" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">invented knives and there&#39;s a reason is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.970" end="00:52:41.140" style="s2">that our current standard narrative said</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.400" end="00:52:42.820" style="s2">this start with Homo habilis this kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.140" end="00:52:46.180" style="s2">of tool evolving capacity rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.820" end="00:52:50.680" style="s2">just tool using capacity so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.180" end="00:52:52.900" style="s2">that so it requires the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.680" end="00:52:55.360" style="s2">city for abstraction which developed</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.900" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">along with prefrontal cortex etc to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.360" end="00:52:59.290" style="s2">able to use this rock and fill the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">sharpness in this rock and fill</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.290" end="00:53:03.220" style="s2">sharpness this rock filler sharpness and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:05.290" style="s2">understand something that is none of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.220" end="00:53:07.450" style="s2">rocks which is the abstract principle of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.290" end="00:53:09.070" style="s2">sharpness what makes something sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.450" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">how could I make something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.070" end="00:53:12.760" style="s2">sharp now I&#39;m not focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2">instance of any of the rocks but a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.760" end="00:53:16.060" style="s2">principle that they all have in common</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:18.010" style="s2">but that is none of them that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.060" end="00:53:20.860" style="s2">abstraction capacity seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.010" end="00:53:23.320" style="s2">emerged with some earlier hominid and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.860" end="00:53:25.750" style="s2">then have Zenith tin Homo sapiens and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.320" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">that allows us to say well I would try</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.750" end="00:53:29.800" style="s2">chipping it with a and to make an</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:31.330" style="s2">arrowhead and then I would make a knife</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.800" end="00:53:33.730" style="s2">and then I would make a laser right I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.330" end="00:53:35.500" style="s2">can keep doubling down on the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.730" end="00:53:38.560" style="s2">principle of sharpness I get evolving</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.500" end="00:53:39.670" style="s2">tech and this is why beavers are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.560" end="00:53:42.040" style="s2">doing the same thing they were doing a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.670" end="00:53:44.170" style="s2">long time ago with regard to tools it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.040" end="00:53:47.650" style="s2">was part of an evolved dynamic and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.170" end="00:53:50.110" style="s2">are changing our entire environment one</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.650" end="00:53:52.350" style="s2">generation to the next so radically now</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.110" end="00:53:55.120" style="s2">why does this matter</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.350" end="00:53:56.620" style="s2">evolution and I know this is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.120" end="00:53:57.850" style="s2">long one but this is because this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.620" end="00:54:00.930" style="s2">actually the heart of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.850" end="00:54:00.930" style="s2">thing so thank you for indulging me</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.470" end="00:54:05.890" style="s2">evolution is a kind of creative process</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.330" end="00:54:08.260" style="s2">meaning it is a process by which new</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.890" end="00:54:11.650" style="s2">stuff comes to exist that didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.260" end="00:54:14.620" style="s2">before and when we think about what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.650" end="00:54:16.780" style="s2">process of evolution is we have some</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.620" end="00:54:19.000" style="s2">kind of mutation and some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.780" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">selection dynamics right so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:22.300" style="s2">distribution of things that are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">similar but a little bit different and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.300" end="00:54:26.080" style="s2">then the ones that are a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.580" style="s2">different in a slightly more adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.080" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">way in the moment meaning can either</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.580" end="00:54:31.960" style="s2">survive or make better end up having a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:33.820" style="s2">better chance of making it through</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.820" end="00:54:42.400" style="s2">that get double down on etc so what we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.080" end="00:54:46.360" style="s2">find is that that process happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.400" end="00:54:48.430" style="s2">extraordinarily slowly not by design</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.360" end="00:54:50.050" style="s2">it&#39;s an unconscious process right</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.430" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">there&#39;s an unconscious process of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.050" end="00:54:54.010" style="s2">mutation and an unconscious process of</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.910" end="00:54:55.720" style="s2">selection nobody is saying this one</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.010" end="00:54:57.130" style="s2">seems like a more truly and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.720" end="00:54:59.290" style="s2">approach let&#39;s go with it this seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.130" end="00:55:00.970" style="s2">like a good future into perpetuity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.290" end="00:55:02.740" style="s2">just these guys actually got food better</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.970" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">or made it better and that&#39;s what gets</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.910" end="00:55:14.710" style="s2">at least in nature one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.800" end="00:55:16.390" style="s2">that happens is that the rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.710" end="00:55:19.210" style="s2">dynamics where power is used in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.390" end="00:55:21.610" style="s2">rivalry sway in a micro context there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.210" end="00:55:25.480" style="s2">a coupling of there&#39;s a symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.610" end="00:55:28.840" style="s2">coupling of the rates of power change so</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.480" end="00:55:31.000" style="s2">as a lion as lions are evolving to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.840" end="00:55:32.920" style="s2">to be better hunters over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.000" end="00:55:35.670" style="s2">hundreds or thousands of generations</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.920" end="00:55:37.630" style="s2">gazelles are also evolving to get faster</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.670" end="00:55:38.980" style="s2">because the gazelles that make it</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.630" end="00:55:40.270" style="s2">through are better getting away from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.980" end="00:55:41.830" style="s2">Lions and the lines that make it better</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.270" end="00:55:43.840" style="s2">getting the zealots right into there and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.830" end="00:55:45.850" style="s2">their reproduction times are similar</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.460" end="00:55:53.640" style="s2">get a symmetries of power you actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.920" end="00:55:57.100" style="s2">have a radical binding of power symmetry</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:06.040" style="s2">thing right now this is key this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.330" end="00:56:08.410" style="s2">actually the essential criteria that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.040" end="00:56:11.080" style="s2">makes micro rivalry lead to macro</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.410" end="00:56:14.500" style="s2">symbiosis is the symmetrical power</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.080" end="00:56:17.230" style="s2">binding imagine for a moment that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.500" end="00:56:19.510" style="s2">could make a mutation where Lions got a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.230" end="00:56:22.510" style="s2">hundred times better at killing in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.510" end="00:56:24.490" style="s2">generation well in that one generation</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.510" end="00:56:25.960" style="s2">they would kill all the gazelles they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.490" end="00:56:29.470" style="s2">eat them all and then they would go</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.960" end="00:56:31.690" style="s2">extinct and so what we would find is</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.470" end="00:56:35.710" style="s2">that those species that were so much</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:37.630" style="s2">more effective than their environment</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.710" end="00:56:39.610" style="s2">could actually navigate in that crate</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.630" end="00:56:41.320" style="s2">resilience - would self terminate</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.610" end="00:56:43.750" style="s2">because of their own effectiveness in</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.320" end="00:56:45.730" style="s2">dependent upon of the ecological niche</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.750" end="00:56:47.410" style="s2">they depend upon they would be debasing</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.730" end="00:56:50.350" style="s2">the substrate upon which they depend</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.410" end="00:56:52.690" style="s2">through their over over expression and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.350" end="00:56:54.970" style="s2">we see this virus happens virus comes</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.690" end="00:56:57.070" style="s2">about it is so lethal that it kills the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.970" end="00:56:59.740" style="s2">host before it gets to I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.070" end="00:57:01.690" style="s2">propagate and then less virulent</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.740" end="00:57:03.850" style="s2">versions of that virus get to propagate</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.690" end="00:57:05.260" style="s2">more and nature actions of selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.850" end="00:57:06.910" style="s2">a virus that&#39;s moving more in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.260" end="00:57:09.010" style="s2">direction of symbiosis than just</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.910" end="00:57:11.770" style="s2">lethality right yes yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.010" end="00:57:13.150" style="s2">evolution itself has this symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.770" end="00:57:15.380" style="s2">power binding why this is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.150" end="00:57:17.570" style="s2">critical to understand is because</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.380" end="00:57:19.160" style="s2">nature does not select for individuals</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.570" end="00:57:21.560" style="s2">of a species and it doesn&#39;t even select</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.160" end="00:57:24.140" style="s2">for species it seems to over the very</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.560" end="00:57:25.730" style="s2">short term but as you zoom out over the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.140" end="00:57:29.420" style="s2">long term it selects for</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.730" end="00:57:33.350" style="s2">self-stabilizing ecological niches where</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.420" end="00:57:34.940" style="s2">the particulars members of a species</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.350" end="00:57:37.310" style="s2">that seem like they&#39;re getting selected</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.940" end="00:57:40.070" style="s2">for over the short term that are super</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:41.810" style="s2">lethal over the long term self-terminate</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.070" end="00:57:46.220" style="s2">and so the things that make it through</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.810" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">long term are these radically anti</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.220" end="00:57:55.190" style="s2">fragile symbiotic systems and so we said</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:57.980" style="s2">so okay we get that in nature and we we</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.190" end="00:57:59.150" style="s2">look at the most badass apex predators</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.980" end="00:58:01.370" style="s2">in nature whether we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.150" end="00:58:04.670" style="s2">lion or a shark or whatever and we look</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.370" end="00:58:06.980" style="s2">at a lion killing a gazelle compared to</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.670" end="00:58:09.650" style="s2">what a human factory farm of cows looks</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.980" end="00:58:11.690" style="s2">like right and we look at a shark eating</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.650" end="00:58:15.530" style="s2">a tuna compared to a mile long drift</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.690" end="00:58:17.210" style="s2">more if a mile long like if</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.530" end="00:58:18.770" style="s2">great whites got mile-long drift nets</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.210" end="00:58:22.010" style="s2">the whole ocean would have not existed a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.770" end="00:58:24.410" style="s2">long time ago and so as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.010" end="00:58:27.470" style="s2">developed technology and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.410" end="00:58:29.660" style="s2">double down on technology we broke the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.470" end="00:58:31.340" style="s2">power symmetry and we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.660" end="00:58:32.840" style="s2">about two applications humans with</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.340" end="00:58:34.190" style="s2">regard to other humans and humans with</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.840" end="00:58:37.730" style="s2">regard to the rest of nature that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.190" end="00:58:40.970" style="s2">depend upon so humans with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.730" end="00:58:43.400" style="s2">other humans the most powerful lion is</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.970" end="00:58:45.080" style="s2">not that much most powerful than then</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.400" end="00:58:46.610" style="s2">more powerful than the next most</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.080" end="00:58:48.200" style="s2">powerful lion and it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.610" end="00:58:50.990" style="s2">much more powerful than the average lion</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.200" end="00:58:53.000" style="s2">or even one of the weaker lions if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.990" end="00:58:59.270" style="s2">think about it like the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.000" end="00:59:01.490" style="s2">lion is maybe 1.1 or 1.2 X more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.270" end="00:59:05.060" style="s2">than that the upper incoming lion who</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.490" end="00:59:06.800" style="s2">will overtake him soon now look at human</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.060" end="00:59:09.350" style="s2">power distributions and say how much</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.800" end="00:59:12.800" style="s2">more destructive power does a Putin or a</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.350" end="00:59:17.780" style="s2">Trump have than you do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.800" end="00:59:19.370" style="s2">dangerous crazy yeah like the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.780" end="00:59:21.370" style="s2">destroy the whole planet versus the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.370" end="00:59:25.780" style="s2">ability to like maybe hit somebody right</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.370" end="00:59:28.070" style="s2">and maybe you can get a gun right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.780" end="00:59:29.210" style="s2">you look at here okay I don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.070" end="00:59:31.610" style="s2">that nine is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.210" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a magnitude it&#39;s a lot okay well</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.610" end="00:59:37.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge power asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:39.590" style="s2">now humans with regard to nature we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.490" end="00:59:41.600" style="s2">cut down the forest much much much</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.590" end="00:59:44.600" style="s2">faster than forces forest can replenish</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.600" end="00:59:46.490" style="s2">we can use up resources faster than they</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.600" end="00:59:49.010" style="s2">can replenish we can create toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.490" end="00:59:51.530" style="s2">first link and replenish etc as a result</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.010" end="00:59:53.870" style="s2">that&#39;s why the ohm den loop dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.530" end="00:59:55.640" style="s2">matter so much is because nature cannot</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.870" end="00:59:58.900" style="s2">actually process the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.640" end="01:00:02.060" style="s2">transitions that we are making right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.900" end="01:00:04.370" style="s2">because we are increasing our predatory</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.060" end="01:00:07.250" style="s2">capacity faster than the environment can</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.370" end="01:00:09.590" style="s2">evolve because the technology is a</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.570" end="01:01:12.560" style="s2">powerful complexity antifragility</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.700" end="01:01:13.880" style="s2">happens by self-organization we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.560" end="01:01:15.590" style="s2">really know how to do that but we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.880" end="01:01:18.560" style="s2">know how to debase it we know how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.590" end="01:01:21.110" style="s2">have the complicated debase the complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.560" end="01:01:22.940" style="s2">substrate upon which it depends that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.110" end="01:01:25.490" style="s2">how we get increasing fragility as we</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.940" end="01:01:28.190" style="s2">have collapse so why this matters is</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.490" end="01:01:30.200" style="s2">technology itself is a fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.190" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">creative process in the history of local</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.200" end="01:01:36.290" style="s2">universe it breaks the power symmetry</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:38.480" style="s2">and as a result it makes micro rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.290" end="01:01:40.839" style="s2">turn into macro rivalry rather than</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.480" end="01:01:44.019" style="s2">micro rivalry turn into macro symbiosis</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.839" end="01:01:46.029" style="s2">as a result rather than get increasing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.019" end="01:01:48.670" style="s2">antifragility we get increasing</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.029" end="01:01:53.799" style="s2">fragility towards inevitable collapse</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.670" end="01:01:55.660" style="s2">dynamics and so what that means is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.799" end="01:01:57.759" style="s2">relationship between the creative</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.660" end="01:02:00.369" style="s2">process called technology creating</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.759" end="01:02:04.329" style="s2">complicated systems and the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.369" end="01:02:06.519" style="s2">between the evolutionary creative</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.329" end="01:02:08.619" style="s2">process creating complex systems the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.519" end="01:02:10.150" style="s2">relationship between those is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.619" end="01:02:12.489" style="s2">that we actually have to change and</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.150" end="01:02:15.130" style="s2">modulate because we still have rival</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.489" end="01:02:16.930" style="s2">risk basis for choice humans choosing</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.130" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">against each other in a reverse way that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.930" end="01:02:23.589" style="s2">came from evolution but now extended</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:26.349" style="s2">through design technology complicated</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.589" end="01:02:29.349" style="s2">systems the our understanding of causal</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.349" end="01:02:33.309" style="s2">the rival risk dynamics are no longer</p>

<p begin="01:02:38.229" end="01:02:42.609" style="s2">which new stuff comes into existence</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:47.009" style="s2">that is neither evolution nor design it</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.609" end="01:02:50.979" style="s2">is a third thing or not designing parts</p>

<p begin="01:03:20.499" end="01:03:26.739" style="s2">design is a actual different</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.279" end="01:03:36.789" style="s2">heart of it design is all about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.880" end="01:03:38.529" style="s2">understanding of causation we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.789" end="01:03:40.150" style="s2">understand the law we can understand how</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.529" end="01:03:42.729" style="s2">a causal dynamic works you can make a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.150" end="01:03:44.529" style="s2">tool that allows us to manipulate that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.729" end="01:03:46.719" style="s2">law right so science is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.529" end="01:03:48.609" style="s2">understanding of causation and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.719" end="01:03:50.469" style="s2">technology is the application of it to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.609" end="01:03:52.719" style="s2">have more effective causation to be able</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.469" end="01:03:54.430" style="s2">to cause stuff at larger scale but our</p>

<p begin="01:03:54.430" end="01:03:57.430" style="s2">and give us a good basis for choice</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.690" end="01:03:58.780" style="s2">because its first person in science</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.430" end="01:04:00.970" style="s2">studies third person which is why it</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.780" end="01:04:02.710" style="s2">said we say what is not what on our</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.970" end="01:04:04.359" style="s2">basis for choice is still coming from</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.710" end="01:04:06.250" style="s2">social Darwinism so coming from a</p>

<p begin="01:04:08.020" end="01:04:12.490" style="s2">towards collapse we actually need it in</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.490" end="01:04:17.770" style="s2">beyond social Darwinism that can be an</p>

<p begin="01:04:25.990" end="01:04:30.819" style="s2">talk about the macro level of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.839" end="01:04:33.069" style="s2">generator functions of X risk it is the</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.819" end="01:04:55.390" style="s2">it thank you for the conclusion there</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.740" end="01:04:57.579" style="s2">and let&#39;s just for the listeners and</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.390" end="01:05:00.030" style="s2">this is gonna be I&#39;m just gonna wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.579" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll kind of transition to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.030" end="01:05:04.839" style="s2">full wrap-up mode but as you said there</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:06.910" style="s2">first we have we&#39;ve already been talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.839" end="01:05:10.510" style="s2">about - did the generator functions of s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.910" end="01:05:10.930" style="s2">extra store one of them as the and rival</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.510" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.930" end="01:05:14.650" style="s2">games with distributed exponential</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:16.930" style="s2">technology with interconnectedness leads</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.650" end="01:05:18.490" style="s2">to self-determination and you can think</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.930" end="01:05:20.109" style="s2">about the loop closures as another part</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.490" end="01:05:22.089" style="s2">of this where you have from a stock and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.109" end="01:05:23.650" style="s2">flow perspective you have depletion or</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.089" end="01:05:24.910" style="s2">accumulation of various things and when</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.650" end="01:05:26.650" style="s2">those go to zero or in those two go to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.910" end="01:05:28.299" style="s2">infinity that&#39;s also really bad for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.650" end="01:05:30.430" style="s2">so those two things our generator</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.299" end="01:05:31.869" style="s2">functions about extras but in fact as</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.430" end="01:05:33.790" style="s2">you&#39;re saying here there&#39;s one kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.869" end="01:05:35.410" style="s2">one meta level above that which is to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.790" end="01:05:38.170" style="s2">say that both of those things are the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.410" end="01:05:39.609" style="s2">result of this new kind of process new</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.170" end="01:05:41.440" style="s2">technological process and that process</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.609" end="01:05:43.059" style="s2">is different than the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.440" end="01:05:44.710" style="s2">process and evolutionary process as you</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.059" end="01:05:45.819" style="s2">said is really good at taking if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.710" end="01:05:47.470" style="s2">think from a multi scale perspective</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.819" end="01:05:50.170" style="s2">it&#39;s really good at taking the micro</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.470" end="01:05:53.470" style="s2">rivalry and trends you know transforming</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.170" end="01:05:56.049" style="s2">it into macro you know symbiosis or anti</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.470" end="01:05:57.880" style="s2">fragility but technology does not do</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.049" end="01:05:59.770" style="s2">that technology does not have that micro</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.880" end="01:06:01.690" style="s2">to macro kind of thing and so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.770" end="01:06:03.099" style="s2">do is kind of think about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.690" end="01:06:05.020" style="s2">relationship between these two processes</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.099" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve created a new process aka</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.020" end="01:06:06.579" style="s2">technology and we&#39;ve had this whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:08.020" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.579" end="01:06:09.370" style="s2">aka evolution we have to think</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.020" end="01:06:11.410" style="s2">what is the relationship between those</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.370" end="01:06:13.780" style="s2">things and how can we make a third kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.410" end="01:06:15.730" style="s2">of process that as you say is something</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.780" end="01:06:17.970" style="s2">kind of a combination of them that</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.730" end="01:06:21.240" style="s2">allows us to do the self designed</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.970" end="01:06:24.190" style="s2">bottom-up anti fragile creation</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.240" end="01:06:25.870" style="s2">so with that Daniel I know we&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.190" end="01:06:29.590" style="s2">time here um and just for our listeners</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.870" end="01:06:31.750" style="s2">too as a quick note a you can go check</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.590" end="01:06:34.780" style="s2">out some of Daniels work at civilization</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.750" end="01:06:36.340" style="s2">emerging calm and I&#39;d recommend that</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.780" end="01:06:38.260" style="s2">because lots of the ideas here are there</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.340" end="01:06:39.550" style="s2">the other thing to note is that likely</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.260" end="01:06:42.460" style="s2">this will not be the last podcast</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.550" end="01:06:44.350" style="s2">between Daniel and I because you know he</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.460" end="01:06:47.560" style="s2">left it at a very juicy edge there which</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.350" end="01:06:50.950" style="s2">is what is the life we have science as</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.560" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">their theory of kind of truth or</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.950" end="01:06:53.800" style="s2">whatever the world what is our theory of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:55.570" style="s2">ethics in the world was there processed</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.800" end="01:06:57.040" style="s2">for that we need to dive into that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.570" end="01:06:59.860" style="s2">need to dive into how this relates to</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.040" end="01:07:01.840" style="s2">our current information revolution how</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.860" end="01:07:03.490" style="s2">this relates to black swans and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.840" end="01:07:05.350" style="s2">precautionary principle in progress and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.490" end="01:07:07.570" style="s2">also what you as a person can do about</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.350" end="01:07:09.130" style="s2">all this uh-huh so well there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.570" end="01:07:11.140" style="s2">another one likely but Dana was there</p>
