<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">okay all of these things i believe to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">true all of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">uh can be and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">are true one systemic racism has a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">history throughout the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">and the legacy of slavery in the u.s is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">a particularly salient example</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">two in the u.s we were making progress</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">against racism both at the societal and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">individual level</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">we weren&#39;t there we were not post-race</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">but we were making progress</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">the legacy of the civil rights era meant</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">that it was ever more shameful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">embarrassing to be publicly racist and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">therefore more difficult to be privately</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">so as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">we were making progress until the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">several years when a perfect storm</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">arrived just two of the parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">perfect storm are these</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">one by the early to mid 2010s everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">was carrying a camera in their pocket in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">the form of smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">video footage of acts of police</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">brutality brought that violence to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">everyone&#39;s living room there was now no</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">denying it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">the flip side of this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">visceral anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">will always be more powerful than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">dispassionate statistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">so long as any grotesque incidents exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">and grotesque incidents will always</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">exist so long as any exist even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">police and policing improve dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">it will now be even more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">point to the hopefulness of the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">and the second of many parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">second of the perfect storm which have</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">eroded the advances of the civil rights</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">correct because i think what you said is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">technically right</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">but having tripped this wire last night</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">i am sensitive to the hazard it implies</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">i have as yet seen very little evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">of white nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">active at this moment in this protest</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">i have i have i have seen no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">okay but many and in fact the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">that i left</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">out here you know people are saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">is it antifa getting in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">legitimate protesters</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">is it and doing the rioting and looting</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">and inciting violence</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">is it white nationalists is it foreign</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">countries right i know all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">out there as hypotheses and at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">um the fact is it&#39;s divisive right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">all i want to do is make sure that we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">not leave the impression that there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">evidence for something for which we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">not have evidence so i&#39;ve seen lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.600" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">stuff that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">there is um unnatural behavior i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">know if these pallets of bricks that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">show up i had another conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">the business owner today was having</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">trouble sourcing bricks</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">something odd might be going on or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">all i want to say is there is no</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">question in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">that what is taking place serves those</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">very divisions</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">and may in fact lead to my biggest fear</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">like a race war that turns into a civil</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">but as yet i have not seen the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">misbehavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">that i uh might expect on the white</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">side so um</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">make of it what you will in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">of the rest i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">i think you and i have not talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">this but i am now having conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">after conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">one person after another somebody i</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">respect will say to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">words to the effect of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">we&#39;re all evergreen now in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">holly mathnerd was the first person to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">say something like this and what she</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">said was it took three years to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">um from for the country uh to reach</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">the evergreen stage uh after evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">now my perspective is a little different</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">because we lived this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">three years ago there&#39;s at least one key</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">difference that i see and we have not</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">well there are important differences</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">especially uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">evergreen did not have a trump figure it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">had a george bridges figure which is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">very different phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">yeah um i don&#39;t know what that is from</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">from history but it&#39;s not trump</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">uh let&#39;s put it this way um</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">it is a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">make light of the situation when george</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">bridge&#39;s ineptitude is in charge rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">the ferocious power that any president</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">would have and the instincts of this</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">uh strike me as particularly dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">in a crisis like this but</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">um one one other key difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">um there was no</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">obvious instigating incident at</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">there were widespread claims of racism</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">any actual incidents and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">uh while we don&#39;t we may never know</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">everything that happened with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">the killing of george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">clearly there was an incident and it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">awful</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">and it was recorded and televised</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">so i mean i think your your 14 points do</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">a great job of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">bringing us to this question because for</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">my part i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">nervous about any single</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">incident triggering uh an outpouring</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">of anger like this because especially in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">this case</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">you know i i don&#39;t know what reports</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen one report that says</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">that george floyd died of asphyxiation</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen another report that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">saying he couldn&#39;t breathe before he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">ever on the ground and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">to the extent that you and i i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">both believe that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">this protest was initially a an honest</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">outpouring of grief and frustration</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">one doesn&#39;t want to pin it obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">this was an act of police brutality</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">did it kill george floyd well probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">but it you know there&#39;s at least one</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">scenario in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">he was dying of a heart attack was</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">deserving of care he didn&#39;t get because</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">this officer had his knee on his neck</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">and so yes it&#39;s a terrible incident but</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">if it is not exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">understood to be by the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">streets</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">does that undercut the reality of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">it is also true that if it is what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">appears</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">that does not inherently make it a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">racist act</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">right he could just be a white cop who</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">kills a black man is not inherently</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">doing so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">because he is a racist right as i said</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">uh the talk years ago how the magic</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">trick is done</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">you know a woman who&#39;s walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">street and takes me to have given her</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">a look that has some sort of content to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know whether or not that same</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">awkward look was given to the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">passed right after her</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">or if it was actually about her being</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">females you just can&#39;t tell from an</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">but none of this i mean i think you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">i would agree none of this really</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">there is honest anger and frustration</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">and it is really truly based on</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">even though the data on police</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">killings of black people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">not reflective of the pattern that many</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">people believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">is just clear right so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">is disproportionate killing of uh black</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">people by cops</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">but in absolute terms it more often</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">happens to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">white people and in any case the data is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">modeled but that does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">that when people who have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">brutality um see it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">film that it does not call forth an</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">honest reflection of some different</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">experience that they are having with</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">cops</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">and so in any case i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">very troubled that everything gets hung</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">on a single incident which can then</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">undercut it if the incident isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m more troubled by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">undercutting of the legitimacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">initial outpouring of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">that came from the looting and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">violence which we have seen so much of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">and i am</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">very interested in us unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">how this all works and why this protest</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">has turned so ugly and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">cynical i would say i mean just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">simple prevalence</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">needless beatings and um and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">stealing of goods and all really</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">just makes it uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">it makes it very hard to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">about it because i feel like there was</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">something to be said at first and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">those of us who would say it have</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">found ourselves in the very awkward</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">position of wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:52.079" style="s2">wanting to be very clear that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">the wanton destruction i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">what even is this there&#39;s no there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">no demands on the table there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">obvious that could be done to placate</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">other than signs of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">failty which are not even appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">well there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">you know it is reminiscent of evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">in some ways in part because</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">some of what is happening is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">exactly the same playbook</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">and um you know what one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">one of the things that i am seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">a demand for for submission</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">and a a call for allyship uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">on the part of all those who would join</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">the cause but uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">don&#39;t have the the right skin color</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s that part is alarming</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">in its similarity to what we saw</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">yeah i mean i think uh in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">history doesn&#39;t repeat itself but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">rhymes and as we said as</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:52.959" style="s2">evergreen was unfolding evergreen was</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">ahead of the curve</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.959" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">but that given time we would get there</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">if people didn&#39;t take the warning</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">we have now arrived there the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">particulars are different</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">you know the hazards are different um</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">evergreen was dangerous and i as</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">evergreen was unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">i had the terrible sense that it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">unfolding that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">uh extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">the exaggerated nature of what we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">was very much like a sort of poorly</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">poorly drawn movie everything was so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">over the top</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">that it was it looked like a movie</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">script in which somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:33.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a knack for subtlety and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">what i worried about the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">was that it was very clear based on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">way movie scripts go</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">especially one written without subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">was that that movie was going to end</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">with an ironic lynching</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">of a white person and that the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">likely person for that to be would have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">me so anyway i was very glad that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">uh i think derailed it i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">that that would have happened but given</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">that the violence was escalating and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">that the police were out of the picture</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">that certainly was seemed a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">and we are now seeing the same things in</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">in uh you know in the nation as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">so one to go back to the first point you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">raised with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">a difference between what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">unfold society-wide</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">uh in in the united states right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">versus what happened at evergreen three</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">right now um is that there was you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">george bridges the president of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">evergreen was no trump</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">and never would have aspired to be such</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">a person and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">the uh the epithets that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">came up with for him involved spineless</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">and invertebrate and beta</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">and you know this sort of thing right</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">and i think this actually points out</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">one of um yeah we we needed</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">a leader then evergreen needed a leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">and the country needs a leader now</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">and in either case did we or do we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">a good leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">but the failures are radically different</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">so george bridges</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">could not figure out or was not</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">interested in figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">actually lead</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">or how to be actually alpha</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">which is what we want in a leader so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">if it&#39;s okay i know you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">places that you want to go here but can</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">i just say a few things about what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">an alpha is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">because i think this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">trump imagines he is but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">the term comes out of animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">and i&#39;ve thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">ever since uh ever since we were in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">college in fact when we were studying</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">with bob trevors</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">and beginning to study the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">social behavior and i specifically was</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">reading the work of franz dewall</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">who who&#39;s an extraordinary primatologist</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">and his work</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">um he&#39;s written many books um his most</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">recent one is</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">mama&#39;s last hug which is about um the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">evolution and experience of emotion in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">non-human animals but at that point i</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">was reading</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">peacemaking among primates in service of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">my undergraduate senior thesis which was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">the role of affiliations and friendships</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">between female non-human primates</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">and um you know typically in social</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">um that have adult males and adult</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">females living side by side you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">distinct dominance hierarchies that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">there&#39;s male dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">there&#39;s female dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">often play by sort of the same rules but</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">and then male female relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">not always inherently sexual but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">different roles there</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">right so um i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">peacemaking among primates dewall&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">from must be the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">in um in reference to this this presser</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">that he held yesterday that trump held</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">yesterday it was so</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">remarkable uh and you pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">george will</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">who is you know famously conservative</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:47.679" style="s2">wrote within i don&#39;t know practically</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">minutes of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.679" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">that press conference coming out an</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">op-ed in washington post</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">in which he said among other things</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">quote that trump is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">a weak person&#39;s idea of a strong person</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">this is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">compelling conservative voices uh that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">we we still have</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">around um you know you and i remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">him from when we were in high school so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">this guy&#39;s been around for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">um dewall makes the argument</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">in uh in his newest book mama&#39;s last hug</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">that most people have a character in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">their heads of what an alpha male</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">is based in fact in part on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">that newt gingrich</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">in the 90s recommended dewalt&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">chimpanzee politics power and sex among</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">apes to freshman congressmen in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">and that this prompted this caricature</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">of self-confidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">and swagger and purpose and alphas</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">beating the hell out of everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">reminding every one day who the winner</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">and alpha goes it alone he crushes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">competition um and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">alpha&#39;s basically like a bully in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">rendering right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">and the truth dewall points out in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">chimps and he would argue in humans as</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">is that okay some alphas are indeed</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">merciless tyrants</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">fair enough the biggest strongest</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">meanest they have uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:08.640" style="s2">they they are exactly that thing but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">they&#39;re the exception that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.640" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">many more alphas that he has seen in his</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">decades of working</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">with non-human primates is that alpha</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">males don&#39;t get to the top on their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">they have assistance the smallest you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">know the actual physically smallest</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">male can be alpha if he has the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">supporters</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">and most alphas protect the underdog</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">keep the peace reassure those who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">distressed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">for me the most surprising thing here as</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">studied social behavior of animals in</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">that he and his his people did an</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">uh i i want to actually take issue with</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">one thing</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">that i so the quote that i gave from</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">george well was uh trump is a weak</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">person&#39;s idea of a strong person is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">that or something else in the end no</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">yeah um i think that this is easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">wrong trump actually is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">strong he has navigated his way to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">successfully and i believe he is riding</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">crisis to his own benefit successfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">to all of our great detriment and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">tremendous risk to the republic</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">but nonetheless there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">power in what he is doing i believe he</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">has an obligation not to pursue it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">that he falls down on that obligation</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">quite regularly</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">what i do think will is alluding to here</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">is that trump is not a secure man</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">trump is an insecure man who is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">compensating for that insecurity for his</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">desperate need for affirmation and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">can hear this in so many of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">that he says where</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">he&#39;s always talking about how great we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">are and how we never lose and then i</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">mean i saw a tweet today in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">you know he he has a parenthetical thank</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">you trump or something i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">thank you president trump for some</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">claimed victory or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">the point is it&#39;s transparent that he is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">insecure</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">and my feeling is um</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">as a man who has observed other men over</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">a powerful insecure man is a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">dangerous phenomenon and at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">it could not possibly be more of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">hazard to us</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">so um he is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">he is successful at wielding at</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">gathering and wielding power</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">and he is dangerous because the end to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">which he will wield it is very</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">frequently</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">a self-aggrandizing end when at the you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">know what we need of course is a leader</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">who is uh a patriot and that inherently</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">means one who</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">will sacrifice for his nation when</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">need be which means bypassing political</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">in order to better the nation to heal</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.120" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">the crisis whatever it is so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">largely in agreement but um but it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">the insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">that i believe is so lethal you i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">you used the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">needy with me a week or two ago you said</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t sure exactly what it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">apropos but this this was beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">to boil all of this and you said</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">i think the trait that i find hardest to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">deal with in other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">is neediness and insecurity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">neediness are not identical but they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">certainly closely aligned concepts</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">well it is particularly bad in a man</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">whose</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">signature is strength and power right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">because the strength and power gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">wielded in a very dangerous way</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">sorry i don&#39;t know what power tool that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">is that threw me</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">here indeed um</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">what did i want to say well i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">forgotten it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">um okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">protests themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">and how they are interacting with all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">this something that&#39;s been on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">quite a bit in the last several days</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">is the tension between a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">a peacemaking dynamic that i have seen</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">hints of many times now</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">and the thing that disrupts it and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">i want to call</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">our viewers attention to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">is the way game theory haunts this whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">so the first thing i want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">riots</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">and looting have a particular nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">to them okay there&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">looting is a thing that has a name</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">that very frequently emerges in history</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">at times of crisis and it basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">works like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">if you have a a city</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">you hire some number of police officers</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">it has to be enough to do the job</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">it and then it&#39;s a diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">problem so you could hire</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">more cops and if you hire more cops it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">costs more</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">and the good you get out of adding</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">another cop to the force</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">goes down with each unit above some</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">and so you want to hire an economically</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">efficient number of cops</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">and that economically efficient number</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">of cops is inevitably based on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">necessary under normal circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">there is a point at which your cops</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">become so busy</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">with some phenomenon that is unusual</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">black swan event or something that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">usual force that keeps people in line</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">that keeps honest people honest</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">breaks down and those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.919" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">hovering closest to the edge of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">border</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">discover that the thing that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">ordinarily penalize them for doing x y</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">or z</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">happens to be preoccupied with something</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">else and so</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">sad but</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">normal uh phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">the problem here is that it doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">very much to put us in jeopardy of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">and in the context of a protest that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">started out over something</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">legitimate we have the added phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">of let&#39;s say that the protest is one</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">thing it&#39;s the george</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">floyd protest and the george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">protest suffers from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">that if somebody loots a store in</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">chicago</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">it is then seen by everybody everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">the protest has now paid the price</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">of the looting that went on on some</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">corner</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">in chicago and that decreases the added</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">of somebody looting in houston</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">so in some sense we have a tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:04.360" style="s2">the commons unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">where the people who are</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">least in line with the objective of the</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">begin to to color the way the protest</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">because they do the dramatic thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">violates</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">the notion that this is an honest</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">and it spreads because uh as long as the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">protest is paying the cost</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">of uh looking bad uh the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">get an upgraded phone is irresistible</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">for a lot of people so</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">um anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s a tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:37.870" style="s2">commons and tragedy is a real tragedy in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">this case</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">okay so now let&#39;s carry through to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">game theory that we&#39;re seeing unfold</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">i never saw it even once</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment at which the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">are calm and the cops are calm</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">and they are trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">negotiate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">right the cops do not like the</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">down on the protesters does that mean no</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">cops like it no</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">those cops are on the force too but</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">there are lots of cops who don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">be cracking down on people and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">getting pushed into it and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">like it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s all understandable so they</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">want to negotiate too</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment of calm there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">sort of exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:31.600" style="s2">light-heartedness or good will or</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.600" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">right and then some asshole lights a</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">does something right or an asshole on</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">the other side decides</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">to fire some tear gas or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">breaks down in an instant and all it</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">takes is one</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">all it takes is one and the point i</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">think that i&#39;m deriving from this</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">always annoyed me that occupy thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:01.039" style="s2">that it needed to be a leaderless</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">movement now it did that for a reason a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.039" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">movement with leaders can be co-opted or</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">their leaders can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">killed or disrupted in other ways so</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">leaders are a vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">but not having them is an even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">vulnerability because what it means</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">is there&#39;s nobody in a position to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">calm</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">the crowd to punish the person who would</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">set off the firecracker there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">actually that doesn&#39;t speak for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s not us</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">right and because that person is absent</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">there is no mechanism for this natural</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">to actually take over we could get</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">we could get there if we had some</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">even after all of the looting and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">violence that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">yeah if if any group could define</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">and allow them to speak for the group</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">there would be fewer bottles thrown at</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">the point that peace is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">the prediction one of the predictions of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">what you just laid out</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">those those things that break an</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">in standoffs between protesters and</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">are more likely to emerge from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">protesters than from the police because</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">um the police does have hierarchy does</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">have leader</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">and um if if the police department in</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">is not wholly corrupt and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">that there are vanishingly few entirely</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">corrupt police departments in the u.s at</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">not to say that there might not be some</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">or that there aren&#39;t some with</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">way higher percentage of corrupt police</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">than than</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">i would then i would want to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">um but someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">a a member of the force who does</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">something wrong as polices emerge as</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">as pieces emerging uh can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">reprimanded um by their leader and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">leader could say</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t stand for us whereas there</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">is no mechanism by which that exists</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">among a literalist hierarchy-less</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">group of protesters peaceful you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">peaceful until they&#39;re not protesters</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">yeah i agree there&#39;s a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">inherent to the police force which</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">allows</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">for control if that&#39;s the instinct and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">this then gets us to this very thorny</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">of the anarchists and in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">the antifa</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">although frankly i don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">play that game anymore i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">antifa exists</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">and you know the president has learned</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">that he can invoke them</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">and rile people up because they make</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">uh so difficult to uh to empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">and frankly they make the entire</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">protest movement so they by design they</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">make it impossible to empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s their whole mo</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">um but the the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:02.800" style="s2">is that they actually have an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">it&#39;s goofy as all get out right it would</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.800" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">not take</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">two hours of careful thought to explain</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">why it&#39;s incorrect and must not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">allowed to drive the movement but you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">never get the two hours</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">right um i must have spent 100 hours</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">during occupy trying to explain to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">anarchists why this wasn&#39;t going to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">for very simple mundane reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to do with anybody being out</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">to get them just has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">basically whether the strategy they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">advocating is stable</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">or whether it opens the door to tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">um but you never get there which means</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">that that little ideology which they</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">get together and discuss privately that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">is then allowed to interfere</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">with the natural tense relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">would otherwise exist between the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">protesters and the cops</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">right but the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">ability of a small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">to demonize the entire police force so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">that the police force</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">are not people they are vermin and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">the police</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">see the protesters in the same light and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">nobody&#39;s allowed to cross the line</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">because that&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">treason that thing is what is causing</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">this tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">and um i don&#39;t know how i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">in a in a leaderless movement and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">obviously is a leaderless movement at</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how it is that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">makes the point</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">generally actually for you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">to have your grievance addressed you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">have to get away from those people</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">they are about something else they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">actually about the wrong idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">that if you tear civilization apart what</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">replaces it will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">better they are wrong about that idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">and they are causing your movement to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">their bidding right that&#39;s unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">and you need leaders</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">to stop it and if you just imagine i</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">mean i&#39;ve seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">comparisons this week of uh the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">with you know 1968 and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">but the big difference is the total</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">leadership vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">on all sides there&#39;s just no leadership</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve got politics being played at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">top level</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a movement in which nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">empowered to speak</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">in the making well</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">i mean another key difference and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">so obvious it feels like it&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">saying but it&#39;s utterly critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">is that um you know as you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">earlier someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">loots in chicago and the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">sees it so there is no ability for any</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">of these protests in any of the american</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">cities to emerge to evolve organically</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">on their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">we would expect that protests that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">happen in portland</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">versus minneapolis versus dc versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">atlanta</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">versus la wherever to be different</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">the people are different even absent</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">and geography it&#39;s just different human</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">beings involved and there will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">different initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">and different people making errors and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">those errors will be different and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">different people making</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">excellent decisions and those excellent</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">decisions will be different</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">what the what social media</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">and widespread access to the internet</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">is for a universalizing of experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">and the destruction of individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">cultural and regional differences such</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">that there is no possibility</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">protests to evolve distinctly in any</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">at the point that we started this became</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">a positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">chaos it was almost impossible that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">could be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">unless you know any city that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">already doing that needed to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">block itself from being able to see what</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">was going on in the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">and we have no mechanism for that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">yeah i i started having a thought like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">when i first saw the um</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">the footage of nicholas christakis being</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">confronted at yale right and there was</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">something so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">odd about this because we now know</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">uh personally and he is every bit as</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">decent as he seems online and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">you know in speeches and all and so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">had these very</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">privileged kids at yale</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">confronting this very decent person</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">as a proxy for some battle that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">anything like evergreen doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">exist at yale right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">at evergreen we had a battle over white</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">supremacy that didn&#39;t exist there</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">as if it existed there and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">thing made no sense because of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">same thing at yale and so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">saying and i i see it too</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">is there is an</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">honest heartfelt objection to something</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t everywhere and to have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">objection raised</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a problem cops and their</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">enforcement against</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">citizens is the is the question and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">cops confronting citizens over this</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">question all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">irrespective of how those cops are doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:12.319" style="s2">with those citizens and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">it basically takes the problem and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.319" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">duplicates it everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">even if the problem wasn&#39;t so bad in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">some places and was really terrible in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">other places and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">exactly there&#39;s there&#39;s real grievance</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">there&#39;s real grievance that people have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">but what we&#39;re seeing is not based on</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">real grievance</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">always well i don&#39;t even want to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not always based on</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">real grievance i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">certain of that that&#39;s not what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">of course there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">phony baloney stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way i think there was</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.599" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">at yale and i think there was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">conversation to be had at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">the thing that made it impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">have the conversation was the accusation</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">that it was present</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">right there right so in other words my</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">if you maybe you&#39;re a black person who</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">finds yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">at yale and maybe there isn&#39;t racism at</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">yale in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">that they were complaining about but</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">because you&#39;re a privileged member from</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">that population</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">in some sense you have a greater</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">obligation because you have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">opportunity to raise the point that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">things are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">generally fair and that lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have those opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">you feel some lineage-based obligation</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">to raise the point</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">because you&#39;ve made it to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">the point can actually be heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t look anything like</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">shrieking at nicholas christakis no</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">right that&#39;s the opposite of what it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">means but</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no we don&#39;t have the proper</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">you know for those who aren&#39;t in a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">position to do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">without alleging that it is themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">that they are speaking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">in some sense and so we are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">dynamic unfold and it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">um it is ironic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">paradoxical counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">and in the end um</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">it makes it just makes the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">unhearable</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">yeah now when i one of one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">the pieces of my 14 point</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">introduction to today&#39;s live stream um</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">that was just part of one sentence at</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">the very end i think you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">spent a lot of time talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">in the past</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">but i think is actually critical the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">drugged a whole generation of people</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">with legal drugs with mood disruptors</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">mood eveners uh as well as steroid</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">hormones and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">and all sorts of other madness but uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">especially uh especially having</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">uh drugged children during their</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.760" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">and they were not allowed to grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">to learn how to experience their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">emotional states to understand their own</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">at the point that they show up in</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve been in lockdown for a while</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">they don&#39;t see what their prospects are</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how they&#39;re gonna get</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">and they see something as brutal as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">being killed while crying for help under</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:38.800" style="s2">and it all comes out yeah it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">out of course it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.800" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">anger is about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">the thing this is not all about</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">george floyd no i mean george floyd is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">uh is the symbol and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:57.119" style="s2">actually a long history of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">with respect to historic protests where</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">somebody&#39;s death</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.240" style="s2">triggers basically you know all of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">pent-up</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.240" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">emotion that comes from all of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">deaths of people whose names we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">so you know anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">a natural process</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m also just struck by</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">the leadership vacuum is really to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just almost impossible</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">to get past it at this point and and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">fact that we are hurtling towards an</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:34.319" style="s2">election that if nothing amazing happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">will result in us uh continuing for</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.319" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">another four years without a leader at</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">the top</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">at a moment when we absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">positively 100 need one</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">so that dynamic itself suggests that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">have a whole</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">addressing but</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">in all of this i keep thinking</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">to interesting uh</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t saying things on twitter but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">the idea that we are not drafting these</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">people to center stage to have that</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">well if you were in trump&#39;s shoes what</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">would you do and i resent the question</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">because i never would have let it got</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:59.839" style="s2">to this spot right i would have um</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">done much more much sooner and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.839" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine botching the job</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">this badly</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">but one of the things that i certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">would have done had i found myself in</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">that position</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">was i would have brought all of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">people in and we would have been having</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">a very deep conversation about what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">state of race relations are in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">especially with respect</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">to black and white dynamics and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">how do i know that&#39;s what i would have</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">done because you and i proposed this</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">very thing whenever green came apart</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">before they forced us out</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">our proposal was to bring many of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">people together for a conference on race</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">to turn evergreen around to take that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">absurd spectacle of a meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">and turn it into something positive that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">would change the national conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">and they said no and they said no of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">course because that&#39;s the evergreen way</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re nearing the end of an hour</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">i want to finish with a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">dostoevsky but i know you have some</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">other things that you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">here i have a couple things that i have</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">to so we&#39;ll return to dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">i promised on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">to explain why i disliked the atlantic</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">article which</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">you have a link to um it was an atlantic</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">is it this yes and it says</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">the protests will spread the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">um and i had an immediate negative</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">reaction to this because although there</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">is positive stuff in this article</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">that title specifically is very</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">misleading</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">and it is misleading for reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">people who have been watching this</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">podcast will</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">intuit one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">we do not know if the coronavirus is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">going to be spread by the protest</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">there&#39;s one reason to think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">actually not highly likely</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">and that is that the coronavirus there</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">is substantial evidence</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">to suggest it is very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">contract outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">now the article does go to great lengths</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">not great length but it goes to some</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">lengths to say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">arrests actually that put people in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">paddy wagons and cells are there for</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">a particular liability but</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">my concern is there is almost certain to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">a jump in the number of cases because</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">the lockdown is being eased that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">jump is going to be attributed to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">protest which is then going to be blamed</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">on the protesters which is unfair</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">now if we can begin to segue to the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">little piece of this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that the protest will</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">spread the virus i would advise</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">everybody who is out there a you should</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">probably figure out what to do about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">riot problem and until you do you should</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">go home</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">but you should wear a mask</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">but one of the things we don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">whether outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">is comparatively safe because of uv</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">light in which case</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">night time will not have that effect and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">they should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">very very careful or</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">if it is something else like the high</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">volume of the spaces and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">of evidence that circumstantially</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">suggests that that will be the case</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">uh the movement of air seems to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">safety and all i&#39;ve seen evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s both and perhaps more but</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">that absent uv light at night there will</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">be less protective effect of being</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">outside but there is still protective</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">effect of having</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">open space and uh dispersion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">viral particles right okay so i said</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">something very provocative</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">on twitter which was that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">this other thing you sent no no the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">the protest could be protective because</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">a lot of people who would otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">indoors during the lockdown will be</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">outdoors where it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">okay i mean i&#39;m not i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a possibility so</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">that could be protective but what i</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to see is us leap to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">conclusion when we do see a jump in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">number of cases which is almost certain</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">based on the end of the lockdown that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">was the protest that did it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">unfair to the protesters and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">it treads very close to a recurrent</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">trope in history</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">where the enemy is declared to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">infectious right so anyway i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">to see that happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">all right a couple other points</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">on coronavirus one i don&#39;t have a link</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">for this one</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">but evidence uh started to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">this week of it being a primarily</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">uh circulatory blood blood vessel-borne</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">virus which is both curious</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">and interacts with the lab origin</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">potentially because one of the possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">techniques that might have been used in</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">a laboratory if this</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">did in fact emerge from a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">would have involved passage through what</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">are called hela cells now hela cells</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">are a very famous cell line from human</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">beings a cell line that has been in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">circulation for many decades</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">and the reason that you can have a cell</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">this is the henrietta lacks</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">um so there was a movie made about her</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">recently this whole story i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">remember exactly what but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">gila being</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">henrietta lacks cell so it&#39;s her line</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">it&#39;s her cell line now</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.680" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re paying real close attention to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.319" style="s2">the podcast you&#39;ll think how could you</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">have a cell line circulating</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.319" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">for decades wouldn&#39;t it have run out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">telomere</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">outnumbers i understand it the number of</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">and they are used as human model cells</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">in many laboratory experiments</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">so cancers have an interesting dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">cancers that actually function and are</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">persistent have an interesting dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">with respect to blood vessels they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">to grow them</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">in order to feed that mass of tissue</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">which is growing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have access to the circulatory</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">system of the body so it would die off</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">it would get necrotic and die off</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:54.640" style="s2">if it didn&#39;t generate its own</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">circulatory vessel so one question is</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">if this was created with a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">serial passage experiment in something</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">like hela cells</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">would it have a unique relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">blood vessels i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly something we would</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">want to study and ruling out the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">possibility that it came through a lab</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">will prevent us from doing so which</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">brings me</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">to the next point so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">told viewers of this podcast that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:21.520" style="s2">laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">origin hypothesis and by laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">origin i don&#39;t mean that the thing was</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">created fully in a lab i mean that a lab</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">would have taken</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">a virus from the wild and might have</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">made a chimera or it might have put it</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">through serial passage or it might have</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">done both</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">and in so doing modified what the virus</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">and then the virus might have escaped or</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">it could just have been brought into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">lab and could have escaped</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">from the lab without modification but</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">that the viability of those hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.720" style="s2">is greatly much greater than what we are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">being led to believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.720" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">by establishment sources</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:57.280" style="s2">and that we are effectively being misled</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.280" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">any such idea is uh preposterous from a</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">course not</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">correct well that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">that those who talk about this idea are</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">obviously not</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">earlier this week so that&#39;s this suck if</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">you want to put that up</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">here&#39;s matt ridley the article is short</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">but excellent and it points out that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">hypothesis is anything but dead and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">the wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">fish market hypothesis is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.920" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:41.119" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this more recently a</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">much more extensive</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">article in the independent science news</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:48.079" style="s2">that argues that in fact the laboratory</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">is most probable which is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">position that i took weeks ago on this</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">podcast these are both worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">they both reference yuri deegan&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">who we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">in an earlier live stream and in any</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">the point here is not that we know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">this came from the lab we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">know and none of these authors would say</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">right but what we do know is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">anybody who was telling you from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">beginning that that was a non-viable</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">was misleading you and we now have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">terrible problem as i warned you we</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">and that terrible problem is that such a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">large fraction like nearly a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">percent of the virology community</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:30.799" style="s2">has been backing this story that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">laboratory origin</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.799" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">was a dead-on arrival hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">now we have no experts we can go to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">almost that&#39;s an amazing predicament to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">be in in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">sars cove ii predicament that we find</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">so in any case that&#39;s more or less where</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">things stand</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">i would argue we have an obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">take this hypothesis seriously because</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">this is where the evolutionary dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">come in if it did come through the lab</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">it will have been modified to laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">that could provide us opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">fight it and it could provide</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">obstacles that we need to know about and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">if we don&#39;t take this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">seriously at the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to figure it out and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">opportunities are going to pass us by</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to fall right into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">hazards</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">all right you want to go to dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">yeah before we</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">before we break yep yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">to finish up the idea of the plague that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">we are experiencing being not just the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">pathogen but also the</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">was an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">showed up for me formally this week on</p>

<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">an account at mimetic value</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">leads us to missing the whole picture</p>
