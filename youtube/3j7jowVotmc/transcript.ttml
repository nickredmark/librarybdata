<p begin="00:15:15.429" end="00:15:21.579" style="s2">you know this is also the reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.449" end="00:15:23.709" style="s2">think that there are some very positive</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.809" end="00:15:28.750" style="s2">violent elements you can make a case</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.459" end="00:15:31.449" style="s2">that certain kinds of social evolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.750" end="00:15:33.610" style="s2">would have never happened without some</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.570" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">with regard to a soft reset it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.730" end="00:15:50.150" style="s2">interesting question oh it&#39;s a soft</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:52.430" style="s2">collapse versus a hard collapse I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.150" end="00:15:55.070" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t think we will see a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.430" end="00:15:56.990" style="s2">very hard collapse in the case sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.070" end="00:16:01.089" style="s2">I don&#39;t expect a massive population</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.990" end="00:16:03.860" style="s2">reduction I do expect some technological</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.089" end="00:16:06.380" style="s2">stagnation and expect compounding</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.860" end="00:16:09.620" style="s2">fragility then you can have something</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.380" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">that&#39;s very very fragile but stays for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.620" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">very very long time in phase transitions</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:18.830" style="s2">right phase transitions between say you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">know gaseous liquid solid forms maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.830" end="00:16:23.390" style="s2">even between plot plasma and and gaseous</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:24.950" style="s2">forms I don&#39;t remember the physics quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.390" end="00:16:27.170" style="s2">right there&#39;s a thing called a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.950" end="00:16:29.210" style="s2">metastable state in a metastable state</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.170" end="00:16:32.150" style="s2">the material is already at the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.210" end="00:16:35.300" style="s2">temperature to start say have water</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.150" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">start boiling but because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.300" end="00:16:40.010" style="s2">disturbance to it it stays in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:42.380" style="s2">previous transition and then if you drop</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.010" end="00:16:46.010" style="s2">like a little speck into this kettle of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.380" end="00:16:48.080" style="s2">like you know metastable water it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.010" end="00:16:50.900" style="s2">instantly start boiling you start have</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.080" end="00:16:53.510" style="s2">this massive amount of steam pump down</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.900" end="00:16:55.550" style="s2">and I think societies when they become</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.510" end="00:16:57.830" style="s2">stabilized or an active in this way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.550" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">think there are metastable state and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.830" end="00:17:07.010" style="s2">can last there for centuries it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">very similar to a dry forest hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.010" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">does this address some of the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:19.040" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s go to WG would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:22.130" style="s2">ask your question hi Sam oh thank you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.040" end="00:17:24.290" style="s2">very much I was just hoping you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.130" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">expand a little bit on the point about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.290" end="00:17:28.429" style="s2">what measures you do track you said you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">don&#39;t follow direct measures like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.429" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">know violence because they could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">misleading and well they&#39;re worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">checking right but I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:37.340" style="s2">people overplay the conclusions you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">reach from them</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.340" end="00:17:41.750" style="s2">I was seeing a sacrum taking the social</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">conservative and I have to say say in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.750" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">ancient Rome the the pagan it would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.550" end="00:17:46.850" style="s2">the social conservative not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">Christian right the social conservative</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.850" end="00:17:51.710" style="s2">critiques are often very subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:53.690" style="s2">all who don&#39;t really account for their</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.710" end="00:17:55.810" style="s2">being different setup so civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.690" end="00:17:57.940" style="s2">could have and then also</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.810" end="00:17:59.920" style="s2">like a very narrow track of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.940" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">like violence it&#39;s really difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.920" end="00:18:02.920" style="s2">define like almost I think almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:04.210" style="s2">everyone who has said something</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.920" end="00:18:06.430" style="s2">interesting about violence is actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.210" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">not quantified that they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.430" end="00:18:12.790" style="s2">describing almost like a taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:14.440" style="s2">when violence is is caused in the human</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.790" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">species right they were looking at cases</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.440" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">or types of violence or moods of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:23.230" style="s2">violence and that&#39;s more insightful okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:26.200" style="s2">so the clarifying my position the police</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.230" end="00:18:28.930" style="s2">oh yeah yeah thank you for thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.200" end="00:18:30.520" style="s2">that um I&#39;m actually you started to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.930" end="00:18:33.010" style="s2">answer the question that I had which was</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.520" end="00:18:39.100" style="s2">what sort of measures do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.010" end="00:18:41.740" style="s2">track well I had a restated I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.100" end="00:18:44.650" style="s2">tracking population so saying that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.740" end="00:18:46.810" style="s2">urban centers cease to grow and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.650" end="00:18:48.670" style="s2">society is like very urbanized but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.810" end="00:18:49.870" style="s2">not increasing in population I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.670" end="00:18:52.450" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting sign that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.870" end="00:18:54.610" style="s2">something very basic has gone wrong if</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.450" end="00:18:56.830" style="s2">you were to keep animals in captivity</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.610" end="00:18:58.120" style="s2">and they consistently had a drop in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.830" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">population that would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:02.470" style="s2">there&#39;s something really really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">with the captivity it&#39;s not clear what</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.470" end="00:19:05.920" style="s2">it is I don&#39;t think the social</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:07.570" style="s2">conservatives are right on this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.920" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">think the feminists are right on this I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.570" end="00:19:13.300" style="s2">think we just don&#39;t actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:15.310" style="s2">what causes the human the human being to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.300" end="00:19:16.990" style="s2">reproduce or not but I would argue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.310" end="00:19:19.270" style="s2">probably very closely tied to something</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.990" end="00:19:21.880" style="s2">like optimism and general well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.270" end="00:19:23.830" style="s2">the belief that life is good but not</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.880" end="00:19:25.690" style="s2">belief in a stated sense it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.830" end="00:19:27.970" style="s2">for a deeply unhappy person to say those</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.690" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">words it&#39;s you know much much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.970" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">implicit right so I would say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:34.840" style="s2">population numbers are pretty good one</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2">technology and ability to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.840" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">advanced technology right so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:42.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna say complexity is good in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:44.380" style="s2">itself in fact complexity brings a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.820" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">of problems and doubling down and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.380" end="00:19:49.060" style="s2">complexity can exacerbate those problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.360" end="00:19:51.160" style="s2">there&#39;s some stuff by Tainter and so on</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.550" end="00:21:51.790" style="s2">a there&#39;s obviously very prominent</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.040" end="00:22:06.190" style="s2">like that I think like for example</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.190" end="00:22:09.850" style="s2">into popular music I think that that</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.940" end="00:22:49.450" style="s2">completely missed that America&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.530" style="s2">was in France it was the Jacobin Club in</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.120" end="00:23:07.659" style="s2">the Russian Revolution it was the</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.580" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">they just think of them as Patriots</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.840" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">which is of course what happens if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">win so I would say that you know worth</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.490" end="00:23:25.390" style="s2">point however the bigger point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.470" end="00:23:26.950" style="s2">like less attention grabbing that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.390" end="00:23:31.230" style="s2">think is a very good one is if will is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.950" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">resource right the ontology of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.230" end="00:23:34.090" style="s2">psychological phenomena is a very</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.750" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">people seem to embody different elements</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:15.250" style="s2">art you know figuring out what will is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.460" end="00:24:16.900" style="s2">is impossible and I definitely believe</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.580" end="00:24:26.740" style="s2">I do believe that there are resources in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:29.409" style="s2">the space of a sabbia as in the work of</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.850" end="00:25:14.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a generational level but I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.740" end="00:25:17.750" style="s2">you were also perhaps thinking something</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.270" end="00:25:19.880" style="s2">more direct like morale in military</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:21.500" style="s2">science it&#39;s look very very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.880" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">morale is an extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.500" end="00:25:25.640" style="s2">resource so in the military sense morale</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:27.770" style="s2">means something like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.640" end="00:25:30.440" style="s2">this ability willingness to carry out</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.850" end="00:26:13.730" style="s2">think I would for example describe hope</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.730" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">felt justified hope seems to be one of</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:23.780" style="s2">human life where I would argue again</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.780" end="00:26:28.120" style="s2">the same thing well Meacham would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:30.710" style="s2">yes I&#39;m not sure I would say quite yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.120" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s there stuff to discuss there</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.710" end="00:26:36.560" style="s2">and if this is the resource that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">lacking then you would I&#39;m just curious</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.560" end="00:26:43.640" style="s2">amilia with a complex manglers concept</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.500" end="00:26:45.410" style="s2">of a Faustian civilization you might</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.640" end="00:26:47.510" style="s2">enjoy reading that because that proposed</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.410" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">you know the the legend the myth the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.510" end="00:26:51.980" style="s2">fast is you know strikes</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">a bargain basically with the devil you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.980" end="00:26:55.610" style="s2">know I will know all the secrets of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:57.950" style="s2">world I will be immensely attractive</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.610" end="00:26:59.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll experience every physical pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.950" end="00:27:01.940" style="s2">and so on all it takes is my immortal</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.690" end="00:27:04.309" style="s2">soul now at the end of the very end of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.940" end="00:27:06.740" style="s2">the story there&#39;s a loophole the person</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.309" end="00:27:08.750" style="s2">gets out of the bargain but the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.740" end="00:27:10.250" style="s2">is that perhaps Western civilization two</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.750" end="00:27:12.909" style="s2">or three hundred years ago set its</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.250" end="00:27:16.490" style="s2">course on this kind of Faustian bargain</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.909" end="00:27:18.710" style="s2">and he contrast this with what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.490" end="00:27:20.510" style="s2">the major in civilization where he takes</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.710" end="00:27:22.220" style="s2">ancient Christianity and Islam could</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.510" end="00:27:24.230" style="s2">actually part of the same civilization</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.220" end="00:27:26.539" style="s2">with a completely different mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.230" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">before that I think he has the a colonic</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.539" end="00:27:31.519" style="s2">civilization so there is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:35.260" style="s2">lot of very interesting theoretical work</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.519" end="00:27:40.220" style="s2">on these topics and it&#39;s worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.260" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">and I would say that I don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.220" end="00:27:44.630" style="s2">impression that 1960s America was</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:47.299" style="s2">primarily driven by the least overt will</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.630" end="00:27:49.010" style="s2">power so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite it</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.299" end="00:27:51.730" style="s2">and it seems like World War two America</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.010" end="00:27:55.669" style="s2">is not driven mostly by willpower</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">so again willpower can like be described</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.669" end="00:28:02.899" style="s2">in other ways at least at least for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:05.690" style="s2">u.s. I incline against this answer that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.899" end="00:28:09.019" style="s2">was that was fun does a great question</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.690" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">thank you great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.019" end="00:28:16.179" style="s2">near on would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:19.250" style="s2">question so you mentioned earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.179" end="00:28:21.320" style="s2">Americans should be paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.250" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">internal Chinese politics just as much</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.320" end="00:28:25.340" style="s2">as British people pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.210" end="00:28:26.659" style="s2">internal American politics but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.340" end="00:28:29.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really seem to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.659" end="00:28:31.909" style="s2">happens do you see that as like a lack</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.210" end="00:28:33.769" style="s2">of demand are we just uninterested to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.909" end="00:28:35.870" style="s2">focus ourselves or do you see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.769" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">lack of access for journalists to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.870" end="00:28:41.149" style="s2">actually be able to get that information</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">back across those it&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.149" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">question I think that I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">would do very well to just start</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.830" style="s2">translating the documents that they put</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:57.139" style="s2">out and examining them critically</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.830" end="00:28:59.389" style="s2">because there&#39;s a massive massive amount</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.139" end="00:29:01.220" style="s2">of documentation released by the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.389" end="00:29:03.080" style="s2">government and by everyday Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.220" end="00:29:05.960" style="s2">citizens every day</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.080" end="00:29:09.049" style="s2">we don&#39;t have enough educated Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:10.730" style="s2">speakers who are also educated in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.049" end="00:29:12.740" style="s2">political science or focused</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.730" end="00:29:17.630" style="s2">significantly on the Chinese system I</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.740" end="00:29:21.110" style="s2">think that there is demand for now there</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.630" end="00:29:22.669" style="s2">is demand to read about China I think if</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.110" end="00:29:24.620" style="s2">our public discourse was a higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.669" end="00:29:26.899" style="s2">quality there would be more demand to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.620" end="00:29:28.669" style="s2">read deeply on China it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.899" end="00:29:31.450" style="s2">extremely important to understand both</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.669" end="00:29:34.549" style="s2">strategic partners and strategic rivals</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.450" end="00:29:36.769" style="s2">we could be reading at least as much in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.549" end="00:29:38.630" style="s2">detail about China as we are about</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.769" end="00:29:41.149" style="s2">Europe I think there&#39;s at least that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.630" end="00:29:42.769" style="s2">much demand in say contemporary American</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.149" end="00:29:46.010" style="s2">society and I say this is a European</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.769" end="00:29:48.460" style="s2">right that only you know I&#39;ve only lived</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.010" end="00:29:53.450" style="s2">in the US or something like five years</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.460" end="00:29:55.730" style="s2">and it seems to me there and that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.450" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">bottleneck is on the education side I</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.730" end="00:30:00.139" style="s2">think there&#39;s just far too few people</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">that speak Chinese and there is far too</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.139" end="00:30:05.960" style="s2">little of the initial organization I bet</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:09.559" style="s2">if there was a magazine that focused on</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.960" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2">translating articles from China and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.559" end="00:30:12.860" style="s2">could get funding I bet they could make</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.240" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">a strong pitch if they had a few good</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.860" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">scholars and I think it would be cited</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">widely by outlets like you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:23.960" style="s2">New York Times would cite them I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:26.149" style="s2">you know the Atlantic would cite them I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.960" end="00:30:28.789" style="s2">think the national interests like</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.149" end="00:30:30.019" style="s2">palladium whichever outlet you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.789" end="00:30:33.250" style="s2">they would be very happy to have such</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.019" end="00:30:37.010" style="s2">material so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.250" end="00:30:41.029" style="s2">it&#39;s a staffing problem I was just</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.010" end="00:30:45.889" style="s2">considering that you know the very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.029" end="00:30:50.870" style="s2">first Japanese state transatlantic visit</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.889" end="00:30:52.610" style="s2">in I think the 1860s where the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.870" end="00:30:55.730" style="s2">barrier was just finding enough people</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.610" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">in Japan who spoke English to go on a on</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.730" end="00:30:59.510" style="s2">a steam boat and go all over the San</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:02.110" style="s2">Francisco and see what America is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.510" end="00:31:05.269" style="s2">right a few years after Commodore Perry</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.110" end="00:31:08.149" style="s2">forcefully forced forced and can</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.269" end="00:31:09.529" style="s2">humiliated Japan by forcing to trade now</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.149" end="00:31:12.020" style="s2">in a lot of accounts this is presented</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.529" end="00:31:13.940" style="s2">as completely reasonable I&#39;ve written an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.020" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">article on why actually trade as far</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.940" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">more ambiguous is not always positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:20.710" style="s2">but I think that we are sort of like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">know maybe America should be like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.710" end="00:31:25.210" style="s2">maybe we should send a steamboat over to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.870" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">China and have onboard all the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.210" end="00:31:29.230" style="s2">that can speak Chinese and have them</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:30.790" style="s2">live in China for six months if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.230" end="00:31:32.980" style="s2">Chinese government allows it and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.790" end="00:31:35.110" style="s2">they can write to us what they see</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.980" end="00:31:40.950" style="s2">I think there&#39;s we should be at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.110" end="00:31:40.950" style="s2">that open to understanding the culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.910" end="00:31:51.310" style="s2">thank you maybe grey would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.910" end="00:31:55.480" style="s2">ask a question hi Sam oh so nice to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.310" end="00:31:57.180" style="s2">you again this week I was really</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.480" end="00:31:59.860" style="s2">lighting up when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.180" end="00:32:01.930" style="s2">domestication and captivity and the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:04.510" style="s2">that we don&#39;t really fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.930" end="00:32:06.430" style="s2">why there&#39;s something wrong with it but</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.510" end="00:32:08.020" style="s2">that we definitely know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.430" end="00:32:09.550" style="s2">lot of harm that comes from it so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.020" end="00:32:12.190" style="s2">would just love to hear you say more</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.550" end="00:32:16.810" style="s2">about what would be bad about fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.190" end="00:32:20.740" style="s2">domesticating humanity yeah I mean again</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.810" end="00:32:23.680" style="s2">it&#39;s an intuition to explore I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.740" end="00:32:26.110" style="s2">that well perhaps for starters like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.680" end="00:32:29.010" style="s2">there&#39;s the observation that wild wolves</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.110" end="00:32:32.230" style="s2">have about 30% more brain mass than</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.010" end="00:32:33.550" style="s2">domesticated dogs so in other words I</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.230" end="00:32:36.150" style="s2">bet the dogs are not thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.550" end="00:32:39.970" style="s2">themselves as much as the wolves are and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.150" end="00:32:42.760" style="s2">I think that you know all of these in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.970" end="00:32:46.900" style="s2">simplistic way the critique of imitation</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.760" end="00:32:48.760" style="s2">or the critique of groupthink it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.900" end="00:32:51.130" style="s2">a very strong critique right so I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.760" end="00:32:53.830" style="s2">if we become overly domesticated we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.130" end="00:32:55.480" style="s2">be come to consensus oriented and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.830" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">will perhaps even as a whole species</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.480" end="00:32:59.830" style="s2">miss important option so it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:02.710" style="s2">from a survival perspective but then</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.830" end="00:33:06.040" style="s2">from a driving perspective I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.710" end="00:33:08.050" style="s2">bad because it suggests that full stop</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.040" end="00:33:13.660" style="s2">we have less motivation to do things</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.050" end="00:33:16.180" style="s2">right if you slow down a computer by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.660" end="00:33:19.240" style="s2">and then say good news is computer lasts</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.180" end="00:33:21.040" style="s2">twice as long I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.240" end="00:33:22.810" style="s2">really done anything worth bragging</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.040" end="00:33:25.180" style="s2">right it&#39;s sort of like a candle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.810" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">burning more less brightly and it lasts</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.740" style="s2">the answer is that you know see the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.670" end="00:33:34.620" style="s2">only way we can avoid this existential</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.740" end="00:33:37.230" style="s2">risk to humanity is to just make us much</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.230" end="00:33:40.860" style="s2">then the macro structure won&#39;t be put</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.910" end="00:33:51.330" style="s2">in that case I&#39;m sort of like now-now</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.030" end="00:34:10.500" style="s2">the what&#39;s the question there with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.340" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">this is where their guard to energy</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.500" end="00:34:13.820" style="s2">return on investment is this the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:17.190" style="s2">question that you would like to ask I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.820" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">guess Sam oh you were talking several</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.190" end="00:34:22.350" style="s2">you know the the sinusoidal ups and</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.860" end="00:35:02.910" style="s2">a cultural level Joseph Tainter in his</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:15.360" style="s2">things that people are looking at is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.690" end="00:35:18.300" style="s2">is for example looking at on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.360" end="00:35:21.500" style="s2">of the club of Rome&#39;s the limits of</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.500" end="00:35:30.210" style="s2">society when the cost of energy or in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.080" end="00:35:36.810" style="s2">this case fossil fuel in our industrial</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.210" end="00:35:39.240" style="s2">economies when that starts it gets to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.810" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">you hit peak when you hit peak oil or</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.240" end="00:35:42.910" style="s2">peak coal when it becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:44.799" style="s2">expensive to extract</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.910" end="00:35:47.170" style="s2">that source of energy from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.799" end="00:35:49.390" style="s2">where it costs more to pull it out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.170" end="00:35:53.740" style="s2">the ground than you actually get out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.390" end="00:35:57.819" style="s2">it then the society starts tanking at</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.740" end="00:36:00.520" style="s2">that point and we&#39;re I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.819" end="00:36:03.609" style="s2">2005 in some cases in some parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.520" end="00:36:06.010" style="s2">world 2010 we were hitting peak coal</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.609" end="00:36:09.010" style="s2">peak oil and this sort of stuff so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.010" end="00:36:12.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s coming to play and also I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.010" end="00:36:14.589" style="s2">think another factor which is I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.520" end="00:36:16.869" style="s2">witting that there&#39;s some relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.589" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">to it but not very direct that in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.869" end="00:36:23.890" style="s2">early 1970s there was another inflection</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:25.000" style="s2">point which was it was the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.890" end="00:36:29.380" style="s2">US history</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:32.230" style="s2">after a hundred and fifty years that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.380" end="00:36:36.910" style="s2">u.s. overcame its it&#39;s persistent labor</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.230" end="00:36:40.839" style="s2">shortage which allowed for the citizenry</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.910" end="00:36:45.849" style="s2">of the u.s. to have rising wages which</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.839" end="00:36:48.039" style="s2">were kind of overcame all of the let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.849" end="00:36:50.049" style="s2">say embedded inequities that were</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.039" end="00:36:52.210" style="s2">embedded into the culture they could</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.049" end="00:36:53.980" style="s2">essentially you know okay my life is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.210" end="00:36:55.809" style="s2">getting better for the majority at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.980" end="00:36:59.500" style="s2">economically even though I&#39;m suffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.809" end="00:37:02.529" style="s2">from all this crap and and after the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.500" end="00:37:04.210" style="s2">1970s that ended so it allowed all those</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.529" end="00:37:06.099" style="s2">problems to kind of come to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.210" end="00:37:09.160" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna shut up and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.099" end="00:37:10.420" style="s2">actually a good exposition the key issue</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.160" end="00:37:12.670" style="s2">here is that there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.420" end="00:37:14.109" style="s2">confounding variables for the 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.670" end="00:37:16.180" style="s2">right you have like you can propose that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.109" end="00:37:18.069" style="s2">it&#39;s the energy there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.180" end="00:37:20.020" style="s2">propose it&#39;s the like replacement of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.069" end="00:37:22.029" style="s2">currency system there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.020" end="00:37:24.250" style="s2">propose that that&#39;s like when you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.029" end="00:37:26.230" style="s2">the demographic crash starts hitting and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.250" end="00:37:27.910" style="s2">it actually society was always a ponzi</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.230" end="00:37:30.700" style="s2">scheme and you needed societies that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:32.109" style="s2">heavy on young people and like on old</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:37.270" style="s2">people because old people are too</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.109" end="00:37:39.549" style="s2">conservative and rigid and like I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.270" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">the return on energy investment is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.549" end="00:37:43.960" style="s2">very good measure I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:46.210" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now partially</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.960" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">because there seem to be a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.210" end="00:37:50.829" style="s2">sources that could be used that could</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:53.640" style="s2">generate very good returns that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.829" end="00:37:56.410" style="s2">like like we not we&#39;ve not hit cheap oil</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.640" end="00:37:59.890" style="s2">right more than us</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.410" end="00:38:03.220" style="s2">crash and oil supply we&#39;ve seen a crash</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.890" end="00:38:05.319" style="s2">and oil demand and that&#39;s unusual right</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.220" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">that&#39;s very unusual I actually am very</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.319" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">sympathetic to this sort of basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:11.319" style="s2">like a Club of Rome style of peak oil</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.700" end="00:38:13.900" style="s2">arguments because they just seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.319" end="00:38:15.759" style="s2">actually completely correct on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.900" end="00:38:17.979" style="s2">of the fundamentals it&#39;s just that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.759" end="00:38:20.380" style="s2">concrete projections haven&#39;t met what we</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.979" end="00:38:22.119" style="s2">are seeing right now perhaps right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.380" end="00:38:23.650" style="s2">we have some different kind of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.119" end="00:38:25.539" style="s2">and then in the future or later in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.650" end="00:38:27.400" style="s2">21st century we actually start running</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.539" end="00:38:29.619" style="s2">into issues when we run out of you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.400" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">uranium and oil we don&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.619" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">been running out of oil right now right</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:37.690" style="s2">so there there have to be at least some</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:47.589" style="s2">additional types of crises that are not</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.690" end="00:38:49.450" style="s2">energy crises cool next question so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.589" end="00:38:51.279" style="s2">have is the declining resource somehow</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.450" end="00:38:55.079" style="s2">related to the proportion of life</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.279" end="00:38:58.420" style="s2">players to dead players in a society I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.079" end="00:39:00.009" style="s2">think that it must be so this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.420" end="00:39:01.779" style="s2">the reasons why I was actually fairly</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.009" end="00:39:03.729" style="s2">sympathetic to the question that will</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.779" end="00:39:06.369" style="s2">and also the question of domestication</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.729" end="00:39:08.739" style="s2">and so on it could be that overly</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.369" end="00:39:12.549" style="s2">domesticated humans actually just make</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.739" end="00:39:15.549" style="s2">for very bad life players without some</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.549" end="00:39:18.219" style="s2">sort of burst of energy and observation</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.549" end="00:39:20.170" style="s2">you go to the lowest energy action the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.219" end="00:39:21.640" style="s2">lowest energy action is doing what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.170" end="00:39:23.380" style="s2">have always been doing or what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.640" end="00:39:26.289" style="s2">been taught to do or what everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.380" end="00:39:28.569" style="s2">around you is doing now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.289" end="00:39:31.900" style="s2">vast majority of things you could do or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.569" end="00:39:33.579" style="s2">could try to innovate are worse than</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.900" end="00:39:35.109" style="s2">what everyone&#39;s doing around you so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.579" end="00:39:38.170" style="s2">there&#39;s also like a local irrational</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.109" end="00:39:40.140" style="s2">argument to be that way right but if no</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.170" end="00:39:43.859" style="s2">one&#39;s doing it then you know not enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.140" end="00:39:46.930" style="s2">experimentation and not enough learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.859" end="00:39:49.269" style="s2">if you never do something outside the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.930" end="00:39:51.279" style="s2">norm you can&#39;t really know why the norm</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.269" end="00:39:53.259" style="s2">is there now can you at least not on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.279" end="00:39:55.299" style="s2">basis of personal experience perhaps on</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.259" end="00:39:58.989" style="s2">the basis of wisdom of people you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.299" end="00:40:01.059" style="s2">trust and that&#39;s important but I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.989" end="00:40:03.339" style="s2">actually argue that if you want to dream</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.059" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">up a new social order or way of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.339" end="00:40:08.109" style="s2">you actually have to live through a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">of them right you have to experience a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.109" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">few of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:13.510" style="s2">few people could object to me saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:16.330" style="s2">that you know Joseph Smith had a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.510" end="00:40:18.430" style="s2">colorful life or if we take you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.330" end="00:40:20.770" style="s2">Prophet Muhammad that he had a colorful</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.430" end="00:40:23.620" style="s2">life or that Jesus had a colorful life</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.770" end="00:40:25.060" style="s2">and if they didn&#39;t have these unusual</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.620" end="00:40:26.920" style="s2">lives where they were like you know</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">that when they get free crane said they</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.270" end="00:47:03.599" style="s2">just in drank so well again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.369" style="s2">not even saying that you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s even worse maybe they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.369" end="00:47:23.130" style="s2">even they don&#39;t even drink maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:25.559" style="s2">they&#39;re just depressed okay okay you</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.130" end="00:47:27.390" style="s2">know much about Weinstein&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.559" end="00:47:29.339" style="s2">doubt growth obligations therein you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.390" end="00:47:31.940" style="s2">have any comments you don&#39;t mind also</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.339" end="00:47:34.170" style="s2">explaining it to those who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.940" end="00:47:36.210" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly worth watching i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.170" end="00:47:38.819" style="s2">sure i&#39;ll be doing justice to eric&#39;s lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.210" end="00:47:40.770" style="s2">i think he is very much worth watching</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:42.450" style="s2">on this topic and googling it the claim</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.770" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">would be that our institutions were made</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.450" end="00:47:46.410" style="s2">on the premise of growth so when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">enter one of our institutions be it an</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.410" end="00:47:50.490" style="s2">educational institution an economic</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:52.589" style="s2">institution you were given an entry</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.490" end="00:47:53.460" style="s2">position and you are told look this</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.589" end="00:47:55.349" style="s2">isn&#39;t forever</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.460" end="00:47:57.480" style="s2">your subordinate right now and yes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.349" end="00:47:59.339" style="s2">kind of exploiting you but this is where</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.480" end="00:48:02.339" style="s2">you learn the ropes and one day you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.339" end="00:48:04.380" style="s2">gonna be like me this is a liar when</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.339" end="00:48:06.599" style="s2">told to grad students today it was not a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.380" end="00:48:08.849" style="s2">lie when told to grad students in 1940</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.599" end="00:48:11.099" style="s2">1940 a grad student could expect maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.849" end="00:48:12.780" style="s2">to be a professor today they&#39;re deluding</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.099" end="00:48:15.450" style="s2">themselves if they expect to become a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.780" end="00:48:18.089" style="s2">professor right the ratio is so</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.450" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">obscurely like lopsided there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.089" end="00:48:22.760" style="s2">such an overproduction of them so what</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:24.930" style="s2">happens if you have a society where</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.760" end="00:48:26.280" style="s2">literally all the institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:28.799" style="s2">these kind of embedded growth</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.280" end="00:48:30.869" style="s2">obligations where they are promising you</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.799" end="00:48:32.250" style="s2">you know it kind of sucks right now but</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.869" end="00:48:33.720" style="s2">you&#39;re buying into the system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.250" end="00:48:35.880" style="s2">gonna have beautiful returns you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.720" end="00:48:38.309" style="s2">gonna have a big retirement you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.880" end="00:48:42.030" style="s2">get promoted you know you go for this</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.309" end="00:48:44.220" style="s2">education and so on like if the growth</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.030" end="00:48:46.290" style="s2">stops you might actually have supreme</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.220" end="00:48:48.450" style="s2">social problems in completely different</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.290" end="00:48:52.650" style="s2">systems all hitting at the bat at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.450" end="00:48:55.170" style="s2">same time now very happy to be corrected</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.650" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">by others but this is my again attempt i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.170" end="00:48:59.549" style="s2">encourage everyone to go check out eric</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:02.140" style="s2">weinstein his interviews on the portal</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.549" end="00:49:03.549" style="s2">are wonderful it&#39;s the one it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.140" end="00:49:06.190" style="s2">sure I really enjoy watching himself</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.549" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">very much recommended and I would also</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.190" end="00:49:10.359" style="s2">make an explicit comparison here to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:12.220" style="s2">peter Turin&#39;s elite overproduction</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.359" end="00:49:14.470" style="s2">thesis where i think actually what peter</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.220" end="00:49:16.930" style="s2">church&#39;s thesis shines is if you apply</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.470" end="00:49:19.089" style="s2">the theory of the overproduction it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:20.980" style="s2">actually fits to a tee what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.089" end="00:49:23.740" style="s2">in the academic system and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.980" end="00:49:25.630" style="s2">very similar prognosis to the one eric</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.740" end="00:49:27.490" style="s2">weinstein would propose exists there and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.630" end="00:49:29.559" style="s2">then also i would you know mention</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.490" end="00:49:32.140" style="s2">empire theory which is a subset of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.559" end="00:49:34.150" style="s2">great founder theory where i also write</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.140" end="00:49:36.490" style="s2">on a similar dynamic it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.150" end="00:49:39.190" style="s2">centralized declining Empire is the type</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.490" end="00:49:40.900" style="s2">of society where I use Empire in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.190" end="00:49:42.760" style="s2">technical sense not in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.900" end="00:49:46.059" style="s2">the Roman Empire the British Empire for</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.760" end="00:49:47.559" style="s2">just as own of coordination maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.059" end="00:49:49.720" style="s2">change that terminology it was a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.559" end="00:49:50.680" style="s2">bit game theory inspired but like right</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.720" end="00:49:52.539" style="s2">now I think you have to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.680" end="00:49:54.789" style="s2">careful with how you name your method</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.539" end="00:49:56.730" style="s2">your your pseudo theoretical concepts</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.789" end="00:49:59.980" style="s2">right you have to be careful about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.730" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">and do you have a reaction to one since</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.980" end="00:50:03.970" style="s2">theory do you disagree with them in any</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">meaningful ways what do you think he</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.970" end="00:50:10.539" style="s2">misunderstands mmm this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">question um what&#39;s always very important</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.539" end="00:50:13.569" style="s2">to talk to people who have very</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:16.539" style="s2">developed theoretical frameworks and do</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.569" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">them justice if I significantly disagree</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.539" end="00:50:21.640" style="s2">with Weinstein&#39;s probably I believe much</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:23.829" style="s2">more in tacit knowledge so it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.640" end="00:50:26.049" style="s2">resource-based focus and view of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.829" end="00:50:28.450" style="s2">economy but rather tacit knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.049" end="00:50:30.369" style="s2">intellectual dark matter essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.450" end="00:50:33.569" style="s2">the failure to transmit that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.369" end="00:50:36.250" style="s2">is being upstream of economic limits</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.569" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">right and he might view it more like no</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.250" end="00:50:39.940" style="s2">it&#39;s the failure to discover new things</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:41.470" style="s2">I&#39;m like no no no I think we&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.940" end="00:50:43.779" style="s2">forgetting how to do some of the old</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.470" end="00:50:45.819" style="s2">things perhaps not where we have like</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.779" end="00:50:48.819" style="s2">physical artifacts like this microphone</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.819" end="00:50:50.829" style="s2">right not yet though sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.819" end="00:50:52.180" style="s2">it took it took quite a while for the us</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.829" end="00:50:54.490" style="s2">to figure out how to put a man into</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.180" end="00:50:59.019" style="s2">space and arguably it wasn&#39;t the US but</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.490" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">a South African entrepreneur and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.019" end="00:51:03.730" style="s2">social technology right the social</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:06.190" style="s2">technology stuff I think might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.730" end="00:51:08.170" style="s2">breaking and I also think not all of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.190" end="00:51:10.329" style="s2">institutions were truly predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.170" end="00:51:11.799" style="s2">the embedded growth obligation so there</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.329" end="00:51:14.750" style="s2">might be a technical disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.799" end="00:51:21.349" style="s2">between us what share our institution</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.750" end="00:51:28.450" style="s2">have this feature great key would you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.349" end="00:51:33.170" style="s2">like to ask your question hi mo right</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.450" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">thank you for speaking to these topics</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.170" end="00:51:42.369" style="s2">and my question isn&#39;t very well</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:45.019" style="s2">articulated but I would think that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.369" end="00:51:47.470" style="s2">growth aspect kind of plays into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.019" end="00:51:52.099" style="s2">question um I wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.470" end="00:51:55.849" style="s2">your observations on on violence um when</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.099" end="00:52:00.829" style="s2">you previously were talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.849" end="00:52:04.970" style="s2">energy as a resource or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.829" end="00:52:07.190" style="s2">domestic occasion piece of it I just</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.970" end="00:52:10.039" style="s2">wanted to ask you how you differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.190" end="00:52:14.140" style="s2">or how you see differentiation between</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.039" end="00:52:17.210" style="s2">like offensive violence and defensive</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.140" end="00:52:22.359" style="s2">violence and how it&#39;s related to human</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.210" end="00:52:22.359" style="s2">nature and ethical actions and culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.559" end="00:52:30.799" style="s2">it&#39;s super difficult right it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.029" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">difficult because you know it&#39;s there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.799" end="00:52:36.380" style="s2">something in humanity there is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:40.519" style="s2">in how we are that causes us to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.380" end="00:52:42.920" style="s2">violence over and over again and we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.519" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">repulsed by it and we hate it but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.920" end="00:52:47.539" style="s2">also love it otherwise our video games</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:49.039" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be as violent as they are our</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.539" end="00:52:50.839" style="s2">movies wouldn&#39;t be as violent as they</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.039" end="00:52:57.289" style="s2">are or Mis wouldn&#39;t be as violent as</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.839" end="00:52:58.940" style="s2">they are right and I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.289" end="00:53:01.730" style="s2">how that works and I also think the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.940" end="00:53:06.259" style="s2">question of aggression it&#39;s always so</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.730" end="00:53:08.390" style="s2">it&#39;s so convoluted there are we could</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.259" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">try to figure out in the primordial</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.390" end="00:53:15.109" style="s2">sense who is the first mover of violence</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:17.420" style="s2">but very soon those calculations become</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.109" end="00:53:19.460" style="s2">so complicated that it&#39;s not clear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.420" end="00:53:21.589" style="s2">very useful to figure out who started it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.460" end="00:53:23.269" style="s2">right perhaps at one point we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.589" end="00:53:24.769" style="s2">like just look at us like look around</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.269" end="00:53:27.049" style="s2">and be like okay this is like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.769" end="00:53:27.830" style="s2">preschoolers like you know beating each</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.049" end="00:53:30.620" style="s2">other up</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.830" end="00:53:34.100" style="s2">I don&#39;t care who started it right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.620" end="00:53:36.050" style="s2">planet of preschoolers right and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.100" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">could say stop but then like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.050" end="00:53:39.560" style="s2">you know if you have to lost him in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:41.150" style="s2">classroom to make them stop I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.560" end="00:53:42.680" style="s2">maybe they were maybe they were happier</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.150" end="00:53:46.310" style="s2">out in the grass and in the trees with</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.310" end="00:53:51.380" style="s2">each other those bruises</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.950" end="00:53:52.790" style="s2">so I would say that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.380" end="00:53:54.710" style="s2">interesting books on this I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.790" end="00:53:59.710" style="s2">possibly recommend without fully</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.710" end="00:54:02.630" style="s2">endorsing let me see if I can find it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.710" end="00:54:04.910" style="s2">like there&#39;s an anthropological book I</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.430" end="00:54:11.030" style="s2">think that&#39;s like a very ideological one</p>

<p begin="00:55:25.130" end="00:55:32.810" style="s2">gonna share it so he&#39;s talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:37.940" style="s2">Japanese society how the reward seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.810" end="00:55:40.970" style="s2">be and maybe you can help engine energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.940" end="00:55:44.900" style="s2">return on or the reward seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.970" end="00:55:47.480" style="s2">prestige rather than like money itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.900" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">is that some kind of resource as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.480" end="00:55:53.300" style="s2">but maybe we&#39;re losing or don&#39;t have as</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2">much of in the u.s. well it&#39;s possible I</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.300" end="00:55:59.450" style="s2">think that in the 1950s for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:56:01.850" style="s2">right the salaries of the CEO class were</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.450" end="00:56:04.130" style="s2">notably lower and company spirit was</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.850" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">notably higher you do realize that like</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.130" end="00:56:08.930" style="s2">IBM in the 1930s people who just get</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:12.080" style="s2">together and sing songs about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.930" end="00:56:13.370" style="s2">beloved beloved president of IBM like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.080" end="00:56:15.620" style="s2">you can find this song it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.370" end="00:56:17.840" style="s2">actually like funny right and they would</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.620" end="00:56:20.090" style="s2">have pictures of like the CEO of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.840" end="00:56:21.710" style="s2">company like everywhere like today this</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.090" end="00:56:24.080" style="s2">almost feels like you know is this kim</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.710" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">jeong-hoon or something no no this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.080" end="00:56:27.830" style="s2">just what these big companies would like</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:29.720" style="s2">so in such a world</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.830" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">well maybe the CEO doesn&#39;t require a</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.720" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">salary and doesn&#39;t require quite as much</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:37.310" style="s2">because they&#39;re already getting paid in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:39.080" style="s2">status and you know maybe companies are</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.310" end="00:56:42.410" style="s2">a little bit more like cults than they</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.080" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">would be today so you know Japan I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.410" end="00:56:45.290" style="s2">is definitely an example of this you</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.760" end="00:56:47.630" style="s2">dedicate yourself to it the company</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.290" end="00:56:49.640" style="s2">become who takes care of you the salary</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.630" end="00:56:51.770" style="s2">differential isn&#39;t great but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.640" end="00:56:54.020" style="s2">deference differential is very great and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.770" end="00:56:56.600" style="s2">I think people can be motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.020" end="00:56:59.180" style="s2">social goods at least as much as they</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.600" end="00:57:01.220" style="s2">can be by material goods arguably a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.180" end="00:57:02.630" style="s2">of consumerism is now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.220" end="00:57:04.700" style="s2">negative side of consumerism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.630" end="00:57:06.170" style="s2">wasteful it&#39;s like you know producing</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.700" end="00:57:08.330" style="s2">substitute goods where you have these</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.170" end="00:57:10.010" style="s2">material markers they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.330" end="00:57:13.460" style="s2">bring you a happiness but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.010" end="00:57:15.500" style="s2">here&#39;s the positive side of it humans</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.460" end="00:57:17.930" style="s2">are so social that we just neglect</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.500" end="00:57:20.120" style="s2">physical fundamentals all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.930" end="00:57:22.460" style="s2">if you kind of convince us to fetishize</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.120" end="00:57:25.250" style="s2">physical things we will take care of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.460" end="00:57:27.320" style="s2">even of physical things if only to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.250" end="00:57:30.020" style="s2">physical things be a token of our social</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.320" end="00:57:32.840" style="s2">games so if you make it so that like</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.020" end="00:57:34.940" style="s2">nice fast car is a status</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.840" end="00:57:37.430" style="s2">goldeneyes fast plane is a status symbol</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.940" end="00:57:39.470" style="s2">then we will do such an unnatural thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.430" end="00:57:42.170" style="s2">as to learn how to like build the car</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.470" end="00:57:44.690" style="s2">and build the plumb so it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.170" end="00:57:50.150" style="s2">if human nature is perhaps been like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.690" end="00:57:52.940" style="s2">know maybe consumerism was like maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.150" end="00:57:55.610" style="s2">was an over response and a doubling down</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.940" end="00:57:58.970" style="s2">on actually something failing desires</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.610" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">not being projected properly where our</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.970" end="00:58:03.320" style="s2">desire to engage with the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:06.020" style="s2">was lessening and we tried to keep touch</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.320" end="00:58:08.780" style="s2">with physical reality by fetishizing</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.020" end="00:58:10.220" style="s2">objects and for a while this work but</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.780" end="00:58:12.080" style="s2">now we&#39;ve even lost touch with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.220" end="00:58:14.060" style="s2">objects we don&#39;t want to even consume</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.080" end="00:58:14.990" style="s2">anymore and it&#39;s not because we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.060" end="00:58:16.670" style="s2">become enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.990" end="00:58:19.820" style="s2">but it&#39;s because we&#39;ve like become even</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.670" end="00:58:21.740" style="s2">more unenlightened you know maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.820" end="00:58:23.630" style="s2">design of Karen or something could be an</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.740" end="00:58:27.530" style="s2">interesting book about that like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.630" end="00:58:29.960" style="s2">know awesome great</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.530" end="00:58:32.060" style="s2">so we&#39;re wrapping up here at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.960" end="00:58:34.610" style="s2">the hour are there any final words final</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.060" end="00:58:35.090" style="s2">thoughts you want to leave us with yes I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.610" end="00:58:36.320" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.090" end="00:58:38.570" style="s2">ultimately promise I would talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.320" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">something about pre foundings and what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.570" end="00:58:42.380" style="s2">would cite here is I certainly wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.900" style="s2">endorse all in every one of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.380" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">historical figures we all have issues</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.900" end="00:58:48.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re often pursuing values that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.060" end="00:58:52.040" style="s2">would disagree with and that many in our</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.680" end="00:58:53.870" style="s2">society would disagree with but I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.040" end="00:58:56.330" style="s2">consider the case of Justinian and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.870" end="00:58:58.520" style="s2">Eastern Roman Emperor who assembled the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.330" end="00:59:00.400" style="s2">team of the very greatest experts he</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.520" end="00:59:02.900" style="s2">could find in all domains from</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.400" end="00:59:05.390" style="s2">accounting to civil administration to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.900" end="00:59:07.850" style="s2">scholarship to law and to military</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.390" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">matters single-handedly turning around</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.850" end="00:59:12.770" style="s2">the faith of the Eastern Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:15.110" style="s2">right so the Greek dominated corner</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.770" end="00:59:17.630" style="s2">Greek speaking part you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.110" end="00:59:20.090" style="s2">reconquering southern Spain North Africa</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.630" end="00:59:23.170" style="s2">and Italy back into the empire arguably</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.090" end="00:59:26.300" style="s2">Rome didn&#39;t fell didn&#39;t fall until</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.170" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">Constantinople was gone like that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.300" end="00:59:31.550" style="s2">example of individual impact another</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.980" style="s2">case I would say is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.550" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">there&#39;s the refounding of Charlemagne in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.980" end="00:59:38.360" style="s2">his era where undoubtedly he reforms</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:40.700" style="s2">what&#39;s basically a tribal structure and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.360" end="00:59:44.060" style="s2">changes it into a proper feudal</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.700" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">structure now again tribal versus feudal</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.060" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">I think today people aren&#39;t very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:48.980" style="s2">sympathize</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">either of those but the fact is that was</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.980" end="00:59:53.960" style="s2">a new civilization new society built and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.470" style="s2">created out of this ruins of an old one</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.960" end="00:59:58.430" style="s2">and then finally I would also give</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.470" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">Augustus and again the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.430" end="01:00:03.230" style="s2">sticking to Western history isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">because seat ramses ii would be super</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.230" end="01:00:07.970" style="s2">good to talk about or some chinese</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:09.289" style="s2">emperor wouldn&#39;t be a great person to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.970" end="01:00:11.480" style="s2">talk about but it&#39;s because these are</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.289" end="01:00:13.609" style="s2">our cultural touchstones right people</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.480" end="01:00:15.259" style="s2">might know of justinian of the Eastern</p>
