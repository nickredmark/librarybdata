<p begin="00:00:17.180" end="00:00:19.870" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.220" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.190" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">I guess we&#39;re in Vancouver Wow all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:43.489" style="s2">that is daunting so I hope you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">indulge me here for a second</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.489" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">Jordan and Sam have given me the honor</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">of moderating this debate or discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">depending on how you view it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:57.150" style="s2">that actually creates a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.010" style="s2">responsibility and I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.150" end="00:00:59.159" style="s2">about my responsibilities and how I see</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.010" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.159" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">and my respite sense of how you all have</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:06.300" style="s2">responsibilities in this as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">I suspect that what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">tonight is actually historical which</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily make it good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">lots of bad history it could be good</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">though and that&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping will</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">happen so the reason I say I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">historical is that we are existing in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">moment where all of the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">have helped us make sense are breaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">down the university systems are breaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:36.690" style="s2">down journalism is breaking down and at</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">that same moment we have a network of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.690" end="00:01:42.120" style="s2">people who are trying to make sense in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">an alternative way and I have to say I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.120" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">think beating the odds for the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem that network is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">entirely in agreement with itself about</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">some significant issues and Sam and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:54.870" style="s2">Jordan have some differences that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:58.050" style="s2">proved very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.870" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">so what could happen tonight is we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.050" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">have some sort of a failure where things</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">get even more muddled we could tread</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">water where nothing gets clear maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">would be entertaining maybe it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:12.269" style="s2">but best-case scenario is that we figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">out how to make sense of things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.269" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">have gotten in our way before and if</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">that happens then you all will leave</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">here and as you talk in your various</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">networks you will have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">about in what way we upgraded our</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">software so that we could talk more</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">deeply about difficult issues so to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:36.120" style="s2">end we would ask the King not film</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">tonight&#39;s discussion and broadcast it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we want to hide this in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">fact we encourage you to discuss it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">we would like to have all of us feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">maximally free to speak here to try out</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">positions that we haven&#39;t tried out</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:55.579" style="s2">before in the hopes that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:55.579" style="s2">somewhere new all right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.430" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">I think with that we will just put Sam</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.379" end="00:03:09.709" style="s2">and Jordan to it and see if we can head</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:20.450" style="s2">towards some of the discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.709" end="00:03:24.489" style="s2">have proved difficult in the past I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.450" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">think I&#39;ll just start by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.489" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">when we first had the idea to do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.950" style="s2">now some months ago I&#39;m getting a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.480" end="00:03:34.730" style="s2">reverb here so if you can dial down</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.950" end="00:03:36.980" style="s2">there&#39;s little feedback when Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.730" end="00:03:40.579" style="s2">I first decided to do an event together</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.980" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">it was after we did those somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.579" end="00:03:46.700" style="s2">ill-fated podcasts and I joked that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">would probably need a safe word for this</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.700" end="00:03:53.889" style="s2">event so that safe word as will come as</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:53.889" style="s2">no surprise is lobster</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:05.490" style="s2">so you&#39;ll know things are dire when one</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">of us says that but you know I just want</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.490" end="00:04:11.460" style="s2">to express my motive for for helping to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">stage these events and because I you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.460" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">know I I reached out to Jordan and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:19.920" style="s2">really was born of seeing him in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">conversation with people other than</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.920" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">myself I saw him do a podcast with Joe</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">Rogan I saw him speak to Dave Rubin as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">I&#39;m speak with Brett on on Rogen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:33.960" style="s2">podcast and I had so much admiration for</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">him in those conversations it&#39;s 90</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.960" end="00:04:37.950" style="s2">percent of what he said in those</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:41.820" style="s2">conversations struck me as really wise</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.950" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">and useful and well-intentioned and 10</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:46.170" style="s2">percent didn&#39;t and but I noticed that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:48.210" style="s2">was close</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.170" end="00:04:49.890" style="s2">clear to me that that you&#39;ve seen these</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.210" end="00:04:52.350" style="s2">successful conversations with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.890" end="00:04:55.430" style="s2">people who I respect I began to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:58.740" style="s2">that you know I might be the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.430" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">I think I I think I am the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.740" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:09.750" style="s2">well before you applaud maybe I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:12.460" style="s2">mean that quite the way you took it I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.750" end="00:05:15.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a good sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.460" end="00:05:19.419" style="s2">problem for Jordan to have because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.160" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">what happens on those 10% moments and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.419" end="00:05:24.759" style="s2">and what doesn&#39;t happen that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:26.440" style="s2">made our conversation so hard and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.759" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">think we there is stuff to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.440" end="00:05:30.310" style="s2">between us so I look forward to doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.050" style="s2">that and thank you Jordan for agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.310" end="00:05:33.160" style="s2">to do this it&#39;s an honor to share the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.050" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">stage with you and needless to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.160" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">having Brett as a moderator as a almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:42.340" style="s2">obscene underestimation of the role he</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:43.599" style="s2">should be playing on any stage because</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:44.979" style="s2">he as you know he&#39;s been on my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.599" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">and that was one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.979" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve ever had so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">for doing this</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.980" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.350" end="00:06:10.010" style="s2">all right so I&#39;m gonna jump right into</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">it I think here so look this is I put up</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.010" end="00:06:14.360" style="s2">a poll a couple of days ago to find out</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:16.040" style="s2">what people broadly speaking might want</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.360" end="00:06:17.390" style="s2">us to discuss and I&#39;ve been taking a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.040" end="00:06:19.370" style="s2">look at that and I took a lot of notes</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.390" end="00:06:21.140" style="s2">which is why I have my computer here by</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.370" end="00:06:24.140" style="s2">the way on my phone it&#39;s not to check my</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.140" end="00:06:26.510" style="s2">email well the debates going on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.140" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">discussion I thought what I might do is</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.510" end="00:06:31.490" style="s2">just lay out some places that I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.310" end="00:06:33.590" style="s2">Sam and I agree and because there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.490" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">of places we agree and so and then I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.590" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">want to figure out where we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been trying to sort out and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">then I want to see if we can hash it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:44.570" style="s2">a little bit and and move forward on</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:46.910" style="s2">that a bit so I&#39;m going to lay out see</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.570" end="00:06:49.160" style="s2">one of the things that Carl Rogers said</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.910" end="00:06:50.750" style="s2">this psychic psychologist was that one</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.160" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">good way to have a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.750" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">someone is to tell them what you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:58.340" style="s2">they think until they think that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:06:59.720" style="s2">you said reflects what they said but</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:07:01.040" style="s2">look this is a really useful thing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.720" end="00:07:03.020" style="s2">know if you&#39;re ever having a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.040" end="00:07:04.640" style="s2">with an intimate partner for example is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.020" end="00:07:06.050" style="s2">that you have to put their argument back</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.640" end="00:07:07.700" style="s2">to them in terms they agree with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.050" end="00:07:11.480" style="s2">very difficult so I&#39;m going to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">that and so so the first thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.480" end="00:07:18.830" style="s2">think I think that partly what&#39;s driving</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">you if this is accurate is that you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.830" end="00:07:24.220" style="s2">to ground a structure of ethics in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:26.870" style="s2">something solid and and and there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.220" end="00:07:28.850" style="s2">there&#39;s two things you want to avoid two</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.870" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">catastrophes let&#39;s say one is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.850" end="00:07:32.840" style="s2">catastrophe that you identified with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">religious fundamentalism and the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.840" end="00:07:36.440" style="s2">is the catastrophe that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.640" style="s2">with moral relativism that is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:41.530" style="s2">reasonable yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.640" end="00:07:41.530" style="s2">okay good good okay well</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s crucially it&#39;s crucially</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.139" end="00:07:50.460" style="s2">important that we get this right now so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.650" style="s2">be and that&#39;s something that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.460" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">really agree on because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.650" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">conceptualized that slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:58.379" style="s2">than you and that might be relevant but</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:08:00.599" style="s2">I think of that as a pathology of order</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.379" end="00:08:02.009" style="s2">and a pathology of chaos so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.599" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">terminology is slightly different but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.009" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">think we&#39;re working on the same axis so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">so so that&#39;s the first thing and then in</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:13.889" style="s2">order to do that it seems to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">your first priority then maybe your</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.889" end="00:08:19.099" style="s2">second priority is something like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:23.009" style="s2">know you see undo suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.099" end="00:08:24.750" style="s2">plenty of it and you would think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.009" end="00:08:28.770" style="s2">things would be better if that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.750" end="00:08:30.990" style="s2">the case and that this morality whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.770" end="00:08:33.329" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be is at least going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">part ground itself in part on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.329" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">presupposition that the less undo</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">suffering in the world the better so is</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:43.260" style="s2">that also reasonable yeah I would just</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.890" end="00:08:45.899" style="s2">add to that the the positive side of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.260" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">continuum as well so as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.899" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">phrase I use though the word I use for</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:52.620" style="s2">this is well-being yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">and I know from having I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.620" end="00:08:55.860" style="s2">spoke about this on my podcast but from</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:08:58.170" style="s2">having seen you in other interviews I I</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.860" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">think you think that phrase doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.170" end="00:09:03.899" style="s2">capture everything one could reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">want but I think it does a mattress I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.899" end="00:09:08.790" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an elastic suitcase term</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:10.829" style="s2">for a reason and it&#39;s it&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.790" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">reading your book I realize there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.829" end="00:09:16.140" style="s2">point of contact here because you use</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:17.880" style="s2">the word beam capital B beam with as</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.140" end="00:09:22.709" style="s2">though it were imbued with significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.880" end="00:09:24.570" style="s2">gravitas and so for me and I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.709" end="00:09:28.110" style="s2">you that&#39;s an appropriate use of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.570" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">and for me well-being is simply just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.110" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">positive side of being you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:33.959" style="s2">the negative side the suffering we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:37.290" style="s2">to mitigate but I think I think however</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.959" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">good consciousness can be in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.290" end="00:09:42.540" style="s2">universe that the well-being for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:44.250" style="s2">subsumes all of those possibilities okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.540" end="00:09:46.620" style="s2">well so what so I focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.250" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">suffering element I think as I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.620" end="00:09:50.069" style="s2">in my own work because I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:51.750" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to zero in on in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.069" end="00:09:53.220" style="s2">like I think it&#39;s easier for people and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.750" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">I think you lay out the argument in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.220" end="00:09:55.170" style="s2">moral landscape kind of like this I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:57.779" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.170" end="00:09:59.399" style="s2">it&#39;s easier perhaps to gain initial</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.779" end="00:10:02.100" style="s2">agreement between people on what might</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.399" end="00:10:03.870" style="s2">constitute a generalized ethic to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.100" end="00:10:05.399" style="s2">concentrate on what we don&#39;t want yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.870" end="00:10:07.290" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that what we do want is</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.399" end="00:10:09.060" style="s2">unimportant but it seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.290" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">harder to get a grip on we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.060" end="00:10:11.790" style="s2">our swift&#39;s we don&#39;t want the Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:14.550" style="s2">Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.790" end="00:10:16.260" style="s2">so and and there are those and I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.550" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">add to just closing the door to moral</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.260" end="00:10:20.600" style="s2">relativism here those who do want</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:22.470" style="s2">outwits are wrong to want auschwitz</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:25.170" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s only happened because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.470" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">some people did want now it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.170" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">victims side but the perpetrator side</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">and so crucially for me is the claim</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:37.019" style="s2">that I&#39;m a realist I&#39;m a moral realist</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">and what realism means is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.019" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">there that there are right and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:42.420" style="s2">answers to questions of this kind and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:43.529" style="s2">and and you can not know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.420" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">missing in fact we almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.529" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing on</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:50.040" style="s2">questions of human value and that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">our job is to discover just how good</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.040" end="00:10:55.800" style="s2">life can be and just what variables are</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">making it needlessly horrible and to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.800" end="00:11:06.269" style="s2">mitigate all of that and live in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">better and better world ok ok ok so</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.269" end="00:11:11.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a lot of points</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">of agreement so I also believe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.810" end="00:11:18.149" style="s2">there is a catastrophe of of arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:20.040" style="s2">moral injunction and that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.149" end="00:11:22.920" style="s2">catastrophe of moral relativism and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.040" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">that that has to be dealt with and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.920" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2">there are genuine differences between</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">the proper way of behaving more lien and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.380" end="00:11:33.269" style="s2">the improper way of behaving morally and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">I think that they are grounded in human</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.269" end="00:11:37.199" style="s2">universals even though there&#39;s a wide</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:39.630" style="s2">amount of variation so that that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.199" end="00:11:41.300" style="s2">of points of agreement right so we know</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.630" end="00:11:44.970" style="s2">that there&#39;s two things we want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.300" end="00:11:46.949" style="s2">we conceptually speaking which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.970" end="00:11:49.050" style="s2">moral relativism and this kind of moral</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.949" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">absolutism that&#39;s grounded in an</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.050" end="00:11:53.339" style="s2">arbitrary statement of facts that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:54.779" style="s2">identify with religious fundamentalism I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.339" end="00:11:56.699" style="s2">would identify that with fundal it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.779" end="00:11:58.529" style="s2">fundamentalism more generally not not</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.699" end="00:12:00.510" style="s2">with religious fundamentalism per se</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.529" end="00:12:02.459" style="s2">because I see it also having happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.510" end="00:12:04.949" style="s2">in secular states let&#39;s say like not too</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.459" end="00:12:07.050" style="s2">many or so it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.949" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">religious fundamentalism per se that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.050" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">crucial to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">argument no it&#39;s not it&#39;s a so that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:14.340" style="s2">to close the loop on that the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:16.440" style="s2">reason why I would focus on religion in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.340" end="00:12:20.030" style="s2">particular there is that religion is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.440" end="00:12:23.310" style="s2">only language game where in</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.030" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">fundamentalism and of dogmatism where</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.310" end="00:12:28.140" style="s2">dogmatism is not a pejorative concept</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.410" end="00:12:31.260" style="s2">the dogma is a good word in specifically</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.140" end="00:12:33.540" style="s2">within Catholicism and the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.260" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">you must believe things on faith that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.540" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">in the absence of compelling evidence it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:39.420" style="s2">would otherwise cause a rational person</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">to believe it that you know religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.420" end="00:12:42.060" style="s2">context is considered a feature not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:43.980" style="s2">bug</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.060" end="00:12:49.740" style="s2">elsewhere we recognize it to be a bug</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:51.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s why so it all right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.740" end="00:12:53.370" style="s2">is it reasonable to assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.390" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">associate we&#39;ve already established at</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.370" end="00:12:56.690" style="s2">least in principle that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:13:00.570" style="s2">association between the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.690" end="00:13:02.010" style="s2">regimes let&#39;s say and dogmatism yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.570" end="00:13:03.960" style="s2">the dogmatism that characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.010" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">religious belief what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.960" end="00:13:09.510" style="s2">although at least in principle the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:11.940" style="s2">secularists totalitarian states and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.510" end="00:13:13.860" style="s2">religious fundamentalist totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.940" end="00:13:15.480" style="s2">states do differ in one important regard</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.860" end="00:13:17.870" style="s2">which is that the religious types ground</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.480" end="00:13:20.550" style="s2">their axioms in God and the secular</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.870" end="00:13:21.530" style="s2">totalitarian types don&#39;t and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.550" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">got to be something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.530" end="00:13:26.820" style="s2">totalitarianism per se that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:28.410" style="s2">independent of that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.820" end="00:13:29.940" style="s2">religious belief in the matter that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.410" end="00:13:31.740" style="s2">just described but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.940" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">particularly associated with the belief</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.740" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">in God there&#39;s something that makes them</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a commonality between them and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:42.930" style="s2">do you have any sense of what that might</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:45.560" style="s2">be well I would I think one has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.930" end="00:13:49.620" style="s2">acknowledge that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.560" end="00:13:51.270" style="s2">uniquely pernicious at least potentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.620" end="00:13:54.060" style="s2">about religious beliefs because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.270" end="00:13:58.530" style="s2">they have the the otherworldly variable</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.060" end="00:13:59.940" style="s2">the supernatural variable the you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.530" end="00:14:02.030" style="s2">going to get everything you want after</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.940" end="00:14:06.690" style="s2">you die so this life doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.030" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">issue that right that allows for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.690" end="00:14:12.390" style="s2">misbehavior that is especially okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:14.460" style="s2">so it seems that so that the claim would</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.390" end="00:14:16.620" style="s2">be that if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.460" end="00:14:18.570" style="s2">put forward axiomatically your claim</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.620" end="00:14:21.770" style="s2">that God exists then you can use that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.570" end="00:14:23.779" style="s2">claim to justify whatever arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.770" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">atrocities your system might throw off</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.779" end="00:14:28.140" style="s2">yeah but the only point I was making</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">there is that not all dogmas are created</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:32.730" style="s2">equal but some dogmas are on their face</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:34.770" style="s2">more dangerous and more devices right</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.730" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">but what I&#39;m curious about specifically</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.770" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">is because it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:41.190" style="s2">dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:44.040" style="s2">Nazi Germany were as pernicious as any</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.190" end="00:14:45.779" style="s2">religious dogmas and and they may also</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.040" end="00:14:47.370" style="s2">share important features with your</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.779" end="00:14:49.620" style="s2">Nicias religious lives but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.370" end="00:14:53.149" style="s2">clear to me from your perspective what</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.620" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">those commonalities would be well so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.149" end="00:14:57.810" style="s2">mean in some ways your recapitulated in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:14:59.490" style="s2">an argument I&#39;ve made and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.810" end="00:15:01.649" style="s2">argument that I would make against you</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.490" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">were you to claim as you&#39;ve had you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.649" end="00:15:07.410" style="s2">elsewhere that that atheism is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:08.760" style="s2">responsible for the greatest atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.410" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">of the 20th century the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.760" end="00:15:15.149" style="s2">Stalinism and Nazism and fascism were</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:16.770" style="s2">expressions of atheism simply doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.149" end="00:15:18.510" style="s2">make any sense maybe in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.770" end="00:15:20.400" style="s2">fascism and Nazism it doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.510" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">sense because the fascists and the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.400" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">by and large were not even atheist emiru</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:26.550" style="s2">Hitler wasn&#39;t it a theist and he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.750" end="00:15:28.529" style="s2">talking about executing a divine plan</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.550" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">and he got lots of support from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.529" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">churches and the Vatican did nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:36.870" style="s2">stop them and fascism as you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:39.270" style="s2">coexisted quite happily with Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:41.970" style="s2">in Croatia and Portugal and Spain and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.270" end="00:15:44.279" style="s2">Italy so but even in the case of Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.970" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">what was so wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.279" end="00:15:49.110" style="s2">situation was where all the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:52.220" style="s2">which it&#39;s so resembled a religion you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.110" end="00:15:57.750" style="s2">had a personality cult you had dogmatism</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.220" end="00:15:59.940" style="s2">that held sway to a point where apostasy</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.750" end="00:16:02.760" style="s2">and blasphemy were killing offenses you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.940" end="00:16:06.900" style="s2">know the people who didn&#39;t toe the line</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.760" end="00:16:09.000" style="s2">were eradicated and you know so and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.900" end="00:16:12.660" style="s2">North Oh to take a more modern example</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.000" end="00:16:15.390" style="s2">North Korea is a religious cult it just</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.660" end="00:16:18.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen to be a one that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.390" end="00:16:21.270" style="s2">focused on the next life or you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.779" end="00:16:22.680" style="s2">supernatural claims so what we magic the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.270" end="00:16:25.110" style="s2">folk okay so what would be the defining</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.680" end="00:16:26.279" style="s2">characteristics of a religious total</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.110" end="00:16:27.480" style="s2">pterri movement that would make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.279" end="00:16:29.399" style="s2">different from a non-religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.480" end="00:16:31.019" style="s2">totalitarian movement because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.399" end="00:16:32.550" style="s2">aspects that are similar yeah they may</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.019" end="00:16:34.680" style="s2">be they&#39;re very similar but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.550" end="00:16:36.300" style="s2">is dogmatism the overarching problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.680" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">believing things strongly on bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.300" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">evidence and B and the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">dogmatism is so dangerous is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.760" end="00:16:49.140" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t allow us to revise our bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">ideas in real time through conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.140" end="00:16:53.820" style="s2">it is it that dog must have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:55.260" style="s2">enforced by force or the threat of force</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.820" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">because the moment someone has a better</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.260" end="00:17:00.209" style="s2">idea you have to shut it down in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:01.910" style="s2">to preserve your dog okay okay so so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.209" end="00:17:04.410" style="s2">commonality seems to be something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.910" end="00:17:06.110" style="s2">claims of absolute truth at some level</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.410" end="00:17:09.660" style="s2">that can&#39;t be that you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.110" end="00:17:10.919" style="s2">allowed to discuss yeah okay and so okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.660" end="00:17:12.329" style="s2">so that&#39;s another point of agreement</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.919" end="00:17:14.549" style="s2">then I would say because part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.329" end="00:17:15.959" style="s2">reason that I&#39;ve been let&#39;s say a free</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.549" end="00:17:16.980" style="s2">speech advocate although I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.959" end="00:17:19.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.980" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">it is because I think of free discourse</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.890" end="00:17:23.549" style="s2">like the discourse that we&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:25.770" style="s2">as the mechanism that corrects</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.549" end="00:17:28.350" style="s2">totalitarian excess or dogmatic excess</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.770" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">and so I also think that systems of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.350" end="00:17:33.299" style="s2">governance that are laying themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">out properly have to eval it have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.299" end="00:17:38.220" style="s2">elevate the process by which dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:40.200" style="s2">errors are corrected over the dogmas</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:41.730" style="s2">themselves which is why I think the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.200" end="00:17:44.010" style="s2">Americans are right say with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.730" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">their first amendment is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.010" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">free speech is the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.380" style="s2">dogmatic errors are rectified and so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">has to be put at the pinnacle of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.380" end="00:17:53.640" style="s2">hierarchy of values I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:55.980" style="s2">totally agree about the primacy of free</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.640" end="00:17:58.200" style="s2">speech okay okay good okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.980" end="00:18:01.599" style="s2">another fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.200" end="00:18:01.599" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.580" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">okay so then we could think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.020" end="00:18:09.460" style="s2">point that we should just lock in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:13.300" style="s2">games here it sounds like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.460" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">saying is that the reason to fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.300" end="00:18:18.550" style="s2">religious dogma is really on the dogma</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:20.890" style="s2">side and not the religion side which at</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.550" end="00:18:22.660" style="s2">least leaves open the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.890" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">something could exist over on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.660" end="00:18:26.560" style="s2">religion side that doesn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.140" style="s2">characteristic right that often they</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.560" end="00:18:31.420" style="s2">travel in tandem but the thing to fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.140" end="00:18:33.400" style="s2">is not the religious belief it is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.420" end="00:18:35.740" style="s2">dogmatic nature of the way it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:37.240" style="s2">well the other way to say that is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.740" end="00:18:40.270" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.240" end="00:18:41.770" style="s2">religion is the dogmatism if you get rid</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.270" end="00:18:43.600" style="s2">of the door I&#39;ve got no problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.770" end="00:18:46.030" style="s2">buildings and the music and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.600" end="00:18:47.470" style="s2">paintings and wait wait no that wait a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.030" end="00:18:49.480" style="s2">minute wait a minute wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.470" end="00:18:51.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not a trivial that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.480" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">trivial point and it&#39;s not just a joke</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.250" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">because the buildings and the music are</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:57.310" style="s2">very important parts of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:18:58.780" style="s2">process and so I know I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.310" end="00:19:00.580" style="s2">humorous element to that but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.780" end="00:19:03.430" style="s2">like Sam is throwing out the baby with</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.580" end="00:19:05.650" style="s2">the bathwater there and to go further</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.430" end="00:19:07.150" style="s2">than that I&#39;ve got no problem in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.650" end="00:19:09.220" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.150" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">phenomenology of spiritual experience so</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.220" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">so whatever experience someone like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:17.980" style="s2">Jesus had whoever he was historically or</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:19.480" style="s2">any of the other major arts and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.980" end="00:19:23.350" style="s2">patriarchs of the world&#39;s religions</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.480" end="00:19:25.420" style="s2">though that that phenomenology is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.350" end="00:19:26.770" style="s2">subjectively real I mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.420" end="00:19:27.970" style="s2">diverse I&#39;m not saying everyone&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.770" end="00:19:30.910" style="s2">the same experience but there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.970" end="00:19:33.700" style="s2">changes in consciousness that explain</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.910" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">both how religions have gotten founded</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.700" end="00:19:38.650" style="s2">by their their founders and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">experiences people have had in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.650" end="00:19:43.630" style="s2">presence of those people or by continued</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:46.030" style="s2">following their methodologies that seem</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.630" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2">to be confirming of the dogmas that got</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.030" end="00:19:52.270" style="s2">that grew up around those traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:55.380" style="s2">my issue is that whatever is true about</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.550" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">presents as a matter of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:08.470" style="s2">spiritually that truth has to be deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:10.660" style="s2">than accidents of culture and just mere</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.470" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">historical contingency is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.660" end="00:20:15.289" style="s2">somebody was born and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:18.039" style="s2">in Mesopotamia and not in China and got</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.289" end="00:20:21.019" style="s2">a different language game and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.039" end="00:20:22.580" style="s2">whatever is true there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.019" end="00:20:25.159" style="s2">understood in universal terms about the</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.159" end="00:20:29.690" style="s2">human mind okay so so another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:31.639" style="s2">that I wanted to just point out</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:34.779" style="s2">obliquely and then I want to return to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.639" end="00:20:36.649" style="s2">outlining maybe where we agree is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.779" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">one of the things that was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.649" end="00:20:42.919" style="s2">shocking to me I would say was the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:44.809" style="s2">my reading of what was originally Jane</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.919" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">Goodall&#39;s discovery about chimp behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.809" end="00:20:47.960" style="s2">you know because there is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.340" end="00:20:49.580" style="s2">was really rooted in Rousseau Ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.960" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">thinking that the reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.580" end="00:20:54.169" style="s2">committed atrocities in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:57.230" style="s2">their group identity let&#39;s say their</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.169" end="00:20:59.059" style="s2">tribal identity was because culture had</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.230" end="00:21:01.909" style="s2">corrupted us so it was this uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.059" end="00:21:04.789" style="s2">human thing but then of course Goodall</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.909" end="00:21:06.769" style="s2">showed in the 1970s that the chimps at</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.789" end="00:21:08.870" style="s2">Gombe I think that&#39;s been pronouncing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.769" end="00:21:10.789" style="s2">that correctly would go on raiding</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.870" end="00:21:13.070" style="s2">parties right and so there&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.789" end="00:21:14.659" style="s2">four or five adolescent chimps usually</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:16.669" style="s2">male sometimes with a female in there</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.659" end="00:21:19.100" style="s2">they would patrol the borders of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.669" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">territory if they found an interloper on</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.100" end="00:21:24.980" style="s2">the border near the border from another</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:27.649" style="s2">troop even if it was a member of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.980" end="00:21:29.539" style="s2">troop that had emigrated so to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.649" end="00:21:31.549" style="s2">that they that they had had some history</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.539" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">with they would tear them to pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.549" end="00:21:36.260" style="s2">of course that was shocking to Goodall</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:37.789" style="s2">but and and my understanding is she had</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.260" end="00:21:39.529" style="s2">some trepidation about publishing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.789" end="00:21:43.070" style="s2">although she did but then that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.529" end="00:21:45.320" style="s2">noted repeatedly in other forms of chimp</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.070" end="00:21:47.750" style="s2">behaviors so see I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.320" end="00:21:51.019" style="s2">interested in the Commission of atrocity</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.750" end="00:21:54.110" style="s2">in the service of belief and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.019" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">tempting to pin that say on on Dogma and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.110" end="00:21:57.620" style="s2">then to associate that with religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:00.950" style="s2">dogma I think that&#39;s all tempting but</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.620" end="00:22:02.919" style="s2">the fact that chimps do it shows that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.950" end="00:22:05.029" style="s2">can&#39;t be a consequence of something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.919" end="00:22:06.500" style="s2">religious belief unless you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.029" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">to say that the reason that chimps</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.500" end="00:22:11.299" style="s2">commit atrocity in the service of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:13.370" style="s2">troop and their territory is because</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.299" end="00:22:14.779" style="s2">chimps are religious and so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.370" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">religious and they don&#39;t really hold a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.779" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2">secular totalitarian viewpoint but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:22.190" style="s2">act out they still act out the atrocity</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.600" end="00:22:23.870" style="s2">element that&#39;s characteristic of human</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.190" end="00:22:25.380" style="s2">behavior and so to me that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.870" end="00:22:28.920" style="s2">problem deeper than one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.380" end="00:22:31.350" style="s2">mirror let&#39;s say surface statements</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.920" end="00:22:33.810" style="s2">surface statements yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.350" end="00:22:36.390" style="s2">obviously the problem of primate</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.810" end="00:22:39.660" style="s2">aggression which we&#39;ve inherited along</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.390" end="00:22:42.330" style="s2">with the chimps is deeper or at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.660" end="00:22:46.020" style="s2">different than the problem of religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.330" end="00:22:48.060" style="s2">violence or totalitarian political</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.020" end="00:22:51.450" style="s2">structure is that okay get the worst out</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.060" end="00:22:53.820" style="s2">of people so but we have we have these</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.450" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">primate capacities that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:22:57.000" style="s2">correct for and we&#39;re busily trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">correct for almost everything that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.000" end="00:23:01.110" style="s2">have been evolved to do and we&#39;re not we</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t like the state of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.110" end="00:23:04.620" style="s2">nature for good reason and virtually</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">everything that&#39;s good about human life</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.620" end="00:23:11.670" style="s2">is born of our I would argue culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:14.460" style="s2">based and and you know highly</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.670" end="00:23:17.370" style="s2">intelligent and necessary effort to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.460" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">mitigate what is in fact natural for us</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.370" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">and that immature there&#39;s nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.840" end="00:23:22.350" style="s2">natural than tribal violence would you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:25.380" style="s2">love this or that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.350" end="00:23:27.810" style="s2">James okay so so then it also seems like</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.380" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">we agree that the the core element of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.810" end="00:23:32.730" style="s2">tribal alliance which would have its</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:34.830" style="s2">roots say in the chimpanzee proclivity</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.730" end="00:23:36.360" style="s2">to or its analog in the chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.830" end="00:23:38.160" style="s2">proclivity to identify with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.360" end="00:23:40.260" style="s2">dominance hierarchy of the troop is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.160" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s a source of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.260" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">proclivity for human social aggression</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:47.370" style="s2">that&#39;s independent of it&#39;s at least an</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:49.530" style="s2">independent of any obvious religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.370" end="00:23:51.570" style="s2">substrate so there are other reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.530" end="00:23:52.650" style="s2">group belief and the commission of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.570" end="00:23:55.890" style="s2">atrocity that can&#39;t be directly</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.650" end="00:23:57.810" style="s2">attributed to to religious dogma yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.890" end="00:23:59.190" style="s2">mean as and what most worries me about</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.810" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">religion I would say that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.190" end="00:24:03.870" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:06.390" style="s2">can channel these primate urges in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.870" end="00:24:07.770" style="s2">unhappy ways so you can get tribal</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.390" end="00:24:09.450" style="s2">violence that gets amplified by</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.770" end="00:24:11.640" style="s2">religious dogmatism and that should</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.450" end="00:24:13.650" style="s2">trouble everyone but it&#39;s not unique to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.640" end="00:24:15.210" style="s2">religion it&#39;s also nationalism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.650" end="00:24:18.750" style="s2">racism and it&#39;s all other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.210" end="00:24:22.820" style="s2">dogmatism but what most worries me are</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.750" end="00:24:25.970" style="s2">those cases where clearly good people</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.820" end="00:24:30.060" style="s2">who are not necessarily captured by</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.970" end="00:24:34.070" style="s2">tribalism per se are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.060" end="00:24:35.640" style="s2">unthinkable based purely on religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.070" end="00:24:37.240" style="s2">doctrines that they believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.640" end="00:24:39.730" style="s2">wholeheartedly with with</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.240" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">good evidence so you have the person who</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.730" end="00:24:45.070" style="s2">joins Isis who wasn&#39;t even Muslim before</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:48.130" style="s2">they converted you know 16 months ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.070" end="00:24:51.549" style="s2">and they go all the way down the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.130" end="00:24:54.520" style="s2">hole to the the most doctrinaire most</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.549" end="00:24:55.779" style="s2">committed most uncompromising view of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.520" end="00:24:58.899" style="s2">just how you have to live in this world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.779" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to be Muslim and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.899" end="00:25:04.840" style="s2">join Isis based on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">salvation only goes one way</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.840" end="00:25:08.770" style="s2">and the dying and defends that the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:10.539" style="s2">true faith is the best thing that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.770" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">happen to you there&#39;s no question that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.539" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">they&#39;re individuals who have made that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:14.919" style="s2">journey in fact there are individuals by</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">the thousands who have made that journey</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.919" end="00:25:18.760" style="s2">and there are far more benign versions</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:20.890" style="s2">of that they&#39;re people who just waste</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.760" end="00:25:22.570" style="s2">their lives I would argue converting to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.890" end="00:25:24.730" style="s2">whatever the belief system is and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:26.950" style="s2">wasting a lot of time worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.730" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">hell or worrying about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">their child is gay and the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:34.059" style="s2">creator of the universe doesn&#39;t approve</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:37.270" style="s2">of that and so there all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.059" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">suffering that strike me as truly</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.270" end="00:25:45.340" style="s2">unnecessary born not of again ape-like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">urges but ideas that any rational person</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.340" end="00:25:52.059" style="s2">would if believed what would follow to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:54.520" style="s2">that that same terminus I mean if the</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.140" end="00:26:29.080" style="s2">take that claim apart for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.580" end="00:26:30.580" style="s2">because that&#39;s not your claim</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:43.929" style="s2">they make is worse than that because</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.700" end="00:26:46.929" style="s2">they claim that the Quran say or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.929" end="00:26:48.810" style="s2">Bible for that matter is the literal</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.670" end="00:26:58.510" style="s2">which means they conflate two things</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.070" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">like because you could imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.510" end="00:27:01.810" style="s2">situation where you had a book and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.810" end="00:27:05.650" style="s2">imaginative exercise where you had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:08.200" style="s2">book that had all the answers that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.650" end="00:27:09.730" style="s2">extraordinarily complicated and so that</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.650" end="00:27:24.090" style="s2">the fundamentalist claim is far worse</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.270" end="00:27:26.620" style="s2">it&#39;s that not only is there an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.090" end="00:27:28.330" style="s2">reality truth embedded in the book but</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.620" end="00:27:30.820" style="s2">that their particular take on that</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.720" end="00:33:23.330" style="s2">you would agree if one of the Ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">Commandments had been don&#39;t keep slaves</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.330" end="00:33:30.350" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s certainly one we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:31.910" style="s2">swap out for that one and and so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.350" end="00:33:33.350" style="s2">would have been much easier for</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:36.170" style="s2">Christians to have fought against</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.170" end="00:33:43.520" style="s2">Muslims frankly to fight against it now</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.550" end="00:33:44.870" style="s2">the problem is that there&#39;s a point I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.520" end="00:33:47.270" style="s2">made I think in my first book is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.870" end="00:33:49.610" style="s2">the the doors leading out of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.270" end="00:33:52.280" style="s2">of fundamentalism don&#39;t open from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.610" end="00:33:54.800" style="s2">inside they get bashed open from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.280" end="00:33:56.900" style="s2">outside and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s humanism and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.800" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">it&#39;s secularism and it&#39;s scientific</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.900" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">rationality that has exerted such</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.009" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">think homosexuality is acceptable right</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.799" end="00:34:32.490" style="s2">zero percent me you there&#39;s almost no</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:35.069" style="s2">question you can come up with where we</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.490" end="00:34:36.450" style="s2">could pull this this this society and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.069" end="00:34:40.619" style="s2">say you know I mean do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.450" end="00:34:44.009" style="s2">that the Lizard King is living in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.619" end="00:34:45.720" style="s2">Oval Office you know that you never get</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.579" end="00:35:00.029" style="s2">morally acceptable apparently you can</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.029" end="00:35:03.630" style="s2">shocking and it&#39;s not an accident right</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.039" end="00:35:05.130" style="s2">and it would be much easier if the book</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.630" end="00:35:07.799" style="s2">actually said actually you can love</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.380" end="00:35:15.150" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a reason that you keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.119" end="00:35:17.640" style="s2">finding yourself that at Islam which may</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.150" end="00:35:21.869" style="s2">be the slowest to update for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.640" end="00:35:25.559" style="s2">that may be ancient but that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.869" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">you that is useful well I can do it for</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.559" end="00:35:30.269" style="s2">Christianity I just I want to make the I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">want to make the point as cleanly and as</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.269" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">undistracted ly as possible but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:36.210" style="s2">it&#39;s admit it&#39;s true I have the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:37.859" style="s2">kinds of concerns about Christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.210" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">Mormonism or Scientology or anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.859" end="00:35:40.499" style="s2">else and they&#39;re all at the point is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:43.230" style="s2">they&#39;re all different and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.499" end="00:35:45.019" style="s2">reason to be because you know Islam to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.230" end="00:35:48.299" style="s2">take the case where it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.019" end="00:35:49.380" style="s2">Islam doesn&#39;t represent any impediment</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.299" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">to stem-cell research</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.380" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">right and because they just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">that that the the the fertilized ovum is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.359" end="00:35:59.190" style="s2">immediately and sold they wait waits 40</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">days or 80 days or 120 days depending on</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.190" end="00:36:03.720" style="s2">what hadith you believe so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:06.329" style="s2">that never came up when we were all</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.720" end="00:36:07.859" style="s2">complaining about how religion in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.329" end="00:36:10.109" style="s2">case Orthodox Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.859" end="00:36:11.249" style="s2">and in the States was posing an</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.109" end="00:36:14.130" style="s2">impediment to embryonic stem-cell</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.249" end="00:36:15.930" style="s2">research okay okay so I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.130" end="00:36:19.319" style="s2">you a clarifying question - yeah sure in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.930" end="00:36:21.390" style="s2">Pope&#39;s same level would you agree that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.319" end="00:36:24.920" style="s2">there are things written into these</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.390" end="00:36:27.210" style="s2">religious texts that are unambiguously</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.920" end="00:36:29.160" style="s2">unacceptable viewed through a modern</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.210" end="00:36:30.650" style="s2">lens and not because the texts are so</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.160" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">complicated that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.650" end="00:36:33.800" style="s2">misunderstood something but there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.180" end="00:36:37.070" style="s2">things that are just written in there</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.800" end="00:36:41.030" style="s2">that we now understand to be wrong okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.070" end="00:36:43.550" style="s2">so so the first thing the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.030" end="00:36:45.500" style="s2">would say is that we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.550" end="00:36:48.080" style="s2">careful about equating all the religious</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.500" end="00:36:50.210" style="s2">texts and I do actually think that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.080" end="00:36:54.170" style="s2">careful about that but that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.210" end="00:36:56.840" style="s2">we can have a discussion about so so</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.170" end="00:37:00.200" style="s2">because you know for a lot of my life I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.840" end="00:37:02.270" style="s2">was I would say more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.200" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">universal truths expressed in religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.270" end="00:37:06.410" style="s2">belief across different cultures but</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:08.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve become more and more aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.410" end="00:37:10.820" style="s2">important distinctions between the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.630" end="00:37:12.530" style="s2">religious cultures maybe in the last ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.820" end="00:37:14.390" style="s2">years so it isn&#39;t clear to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.530" end="00:37:17.780" style="s2">can just throw all religious dictum</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.390" end="00:37:19.850" style="s2">dicta in the same bucket and there maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.780" end="00:37:21.890" style="s2">there&#39;s complex reasons for that so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.850" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">know and one question which you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.890" end="00:37:28.070" style="s2">sent it Sam already is do you see a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:30.080" style="s2">hierarchy of unacceptability between</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.070" end="00:37:31.880" style="s2">different religious doctrines I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.080" end="00:37:34.670" style="s2">I would say act it okay fine fine fine</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.880" end="00:37:37.820" style="s2">so okay now but here here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.670" end="00:37:40.670" style="s2">interesting issue and and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.820" end="00:37:43.010" style="s2">starting to zero in on we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.670" end="00:37:44.810" style="s2">what we agree on a lot of it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.010" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">no answer Bret&#39;s question because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.810" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">think sorry sorry I answered the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:57.560" style="s2">half of it but the second part is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:58.970" style="s2">think that this is where I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.560" end="00:38:01.360" style="s2">sound like a postmodernist which I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.970" end="00:38:01.360" style="s2">really hate</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:12.470" style="s2">I would say sentence by sentence yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.290" end="00:38:16.920" style="s2">you&#39;re correct paragraph by paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.470" end="00:38:18.750" style="s2">perhaps but here&#39;s here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.920" end="00:38:21.210" style="s2">with complicated texts especially ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.750" end="00:38:24.329" style="s2">that actually constitute narratives so</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.210" end="00:38:26.760" style="s2">in imagine imagine this so you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.329" end="00:38:29.730" style="s2">you&#39;re at a movie and it&#39;s a movie with</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.760" end="00:38:31.859" style="s2">a twist at the end and so the entire</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.730" end="00:38:33.150" style="s2">movie is set up to make you think one</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.859" end="00:38:35.069" style="s2">particular way and to have one set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.150" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">experiences but when you put the twists</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.069" end="00:38:39.569" style="s2">in at the end it changes the entire</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:41.670" style="s2">structure and so this is the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.569" end="00:38:43.950" style="s2">complex problems that actually led to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.670" end="00:38:46.290" style="s2">the rise of postmodern interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.950" end="00:38:48.119" style="s2">of literature which is that if you take</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.290" end="00:38:50.790" style="s2">a complex narrative there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.119" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">number of ways of interpreting it and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.790" end="00:38:55.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t self-evident which of those are</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:58.530" style="s2">canonically correct and we can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.140" end="00:39:01.079" style="s2">that horrible issue later but but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.530" end="00:39:03.300" style="s2">good objection and it&#39;s true and what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.079" end="00:39:06.329" style="s2">does is it makes these sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.300" end="00:39:10.140" style="s2">quite complicated because in the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.329" end="00:39:11.700" style="s2">Bible is a series of books and they had</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">influence on one another and they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.700" end="00:39:15.780" style="s2">sequenced with a very complex editorial</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.150" style="s2">process and there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.780" end="00:39:20.819" style="s2">developmental narrative that links all</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.150" end="00:39:23.130" style="s2">the chapters together and what that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.819" end="00:39:25.890" style="s2">means this is at least I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.130" end="00:39:28.700" style="s2">speak from from the perspective or in</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.890" end="00:39:32.609" style="s2">terms of analysis of the Christian Bible</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.700" end="00:39:36.750" style="s2">what it means is that you have to read</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.609" end="00:39:39.000" style="s2">the beginning as if it&#39;s also influenced</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.750" end="00:39:40.559" style="s2">by the end which is what by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.000" end="00:39:43.940" style="s2">in case you think that I&#39;m weaseling</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.559" end="00:39:46.260" style="s2">around here and I&#39;m not is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.940" end="00:39:48.690" style="s2">exactly what you do every time you read</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.260" end="00:39:50.369" style="s2">any story any work of fiction you say</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.690" end="00:39:51.630" style="s2">well you&#39;re not claiming that the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.369" end="00:39:53.690" style="s2">is a work of fiction it&#39;s like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.630" end="00:39:56.010" style="s2">don&#39;t that&#39;s it that&#39;s just a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.690" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">objection that&#39;s not my point my point</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.010" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a narrative and everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">in a narrative is conditioned by all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:05.069" style="s2">rest of the things in the narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:06.690" style="s2">it is well known like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.069" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">screenwriter for example there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.690" end="00:40:10.140" style="s2">dictum remember who generated was one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:12.829" style="s2">the great Russians that if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.140" end="00:40:14.569" style="s2">rifle lying on a table in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.829" end="00:40:15.829" style="s2">first scene that it better be used by</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.569" end="00:40:17.059" style="s2">the end of the second scene or it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.829" end="00:40:19.609" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have been there at all so</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.059" end="00:40:20.839" style="s2">there&#39;s this coherence I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.609" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">the rifle in your answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.839" end="00:40:27.559" style="s2">question yeah I want to be used my point</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:29.539" style="s2">is is that it isn&#39;t reasonable to take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.559" end="00:40:31.729" style="s2">single sentence out of a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.539" end="00:40:34.339" style="s2">narrative and say that stands on its own</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.729" end="00:40:36.259" style="s2">or it&#39;s rarely reasonable because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.339" end="00:40:37.609" style="s2">have to interpret the word in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.259" end="00:40:39.079" style="s2">sentence and the sentence in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.609" end="00:40:41.029" style="s2">paragraph and the paragraph in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.079" end="00:40:43.069" style="s2">chapter and the chapter in the context</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.029" end="00:40:45.049" style="s2">of the entire book you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.069" end="00:40:47.269" style="s2">now you could object and reasonably so</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.049" end="00:40:50.719" style="s2">that there are some sentences that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.269" end="00:40:53.630" style="s2">so blatant that you can&#39;t use context to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.719" end="00:40:55.339" style="s2">to what paraphrase them let&#39;s say but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.630" end="00:40:57.140" style="s2">think you also have to give the devil</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.339" end="00:40:59.059" style="s2">let&#39;s do that the Christian Bible is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.140" end="00:41:00.739" style="s2">developmental narrative and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.059" end="00:41:03.739" style="s2">beginning has to be read in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.739" end="00:41:07.190" style="s2">end and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s is it a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.739" end="00:41:09.979" style="s2">fact so what does that do to Moses&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.190" end="00:41:13.099" style="s2">laws of war no this is not a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.979" end="00:41:15.259" style="s2">this is instructions about what to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.099" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">when you invade a foreign land if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.259" end="00:41:21.799" style="s2">intend to take over that land you kill</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:24.349" style="s2">every break right there are other rules</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.799" end="00:41:27.019" style="s2">in there about killing husbands and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.349" end="00:41:29.150" style="s2">taking the wives yeah this custom it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.019" end="00:41:31.039" style="s2">brutal document absolutely brutal and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.150" end="00:41:34.819" style="s2">my point would be I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.039" end="00:41:36.619" style="s2">reading that portion in light of the end</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.819" end="00:41:38.719" style="s2">even if you call the end of the New</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.619" end="00:41:40.819" style="s2">Testament I don&#39;t know that it changes</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.719" end="00:41:43.099" style="s2">Moses&#39;s laws of war and their</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.819" end="00:41:45.049" style="s2">acceptability well hypothetically if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.099" end="00:41:47.329" style="s2">take the New Testament seriously it does</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.049" end="00:41:49.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s a suit it&#39;s a document that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.329" end="00:41:50.779" style="s2">supersedes it and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.130" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">actually technical reasons doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.779" end="00:41:54.049" style="s2">supersede it on every point I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:57.079" style="s2">is a problem slavery is a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.049" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">straightforward case because clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.079" end="00:42:01.880" style="s2">the the bible thumpers of the south who</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">were defending slavery with reference to</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.880" end="00:42:05.479" style="s2">the text felt they were on firm ground</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.699" style="s2">and i would just I would invite anyone</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.479" end="00:42:09.619" style="s2">to read what the the New Testament and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.699" end="00:42:11.809" style="s2">the Old Testament say about slavery to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.619" end="00:42:14.329" style="s2">see that they were on fairly firm ground</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.809" end="00:42:15.969" style="s2">that the the balance of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.329" end="00:42:19.160" style="s2">honest reading was on the side of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.969" end="00:42:21.890" style="s2">clearly we can we can keep slaves right</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.160" end="00:42:24.500" style="s2">Jesus Jean Jesus never envisioned a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.890" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">world without slavery and he had ma</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.500" end="00:42:27.860" style="s2">slaves to serve their masters well and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:30.260" style="s2">to serve their Christian masters</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.860" end="00:42:31.340" style="s2">especially well English Protestants</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.260" end="00:42:32.840" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have agreed with that because</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.340" end="00:42:34.520" style="s2">like I said they were at the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.840" end="00:42:36.260" style="s2">of the fight against slave okay but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.520" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">think they&#39;re really influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.260" end="00:42:42.680" style="s2">something outside the text and this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:46.250" style="s2">begin is you&#39;re making this harder than</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.680" end="00:42:48.680" style="s2">it is and my concern is why well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.250" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">think I am because I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.680" end="00:42:53.540" style="s2">fundamental message in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">for example is that so that usually all</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.540" end="00:42:58.100" style="s2">that if we so-so Jews are in possession</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">of a book that has some diabolical</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.100" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">passages that would be better left out</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.850" end="00:43:08.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to offend it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:11.180" style="s2">it&#39;s in the Old Testament itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.990" end="00:43:13.850" style="s2">Jewish Bible there&#39;s there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.180" end="00:43:15.950" style="s2">seeds of the same tension so for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.850" end="00:43:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension and this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.950" end="00:43:19.610" style="s2">tension that&#39;s of interest to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.210" end="00:43:21.680" style="s2">because you you&#39;ve stated quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.610" end="00:43:23.300" style="s2">in your book in in the moral landscape</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.680" end="00:43:25.100" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to throw the baby</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.300" end="00:43:26.900" style="s2">out with the bathwater with regards at</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.100" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">least two religious phenomenology you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.900" end="00:43:32.690" style="s2">said that for example I still consider</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:34.700" style="s2">the world&#39;s religions to be mere</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.690" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">intellectual runes maintained at</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.700" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">enormous economic and social cost but</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:39.950" style="s2">now I understood that important</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:41.870" style="s2">psychological truths could be found in</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:43.700" style="s2">the rubble well I&#39;m trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.870" end="00:43:46.730" style="s2">important psychological truths in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.700" end="00:43:48.620" style="s2">rubble and so and so but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.730" end="00:43:50.780" style="s2">decide also if we agree about that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.620" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">are there important psychological truths</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.780" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">to be found in the rubble oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:58.580" style="s2">okay so with the problem with revelation</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:44:01.130" style="s2">this notion of revelation this notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.580" end="00:44:04.070" style="s2">that some books weren&#39;t written by smart</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.130" end="00:44:07.010" style="s2">people they were written by God allows</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.070" end="00:44:09.260" style="s2">you it confines you to take in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.010" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">text even though this text was cobbled</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.260" end="00:44:12.950" style="s2">together over centuries and some four</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:14.300" style="s2">whole centuries some books were in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.950" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">New Testament and then they got thrown</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.300" end="00:44:18.410" style="s2">out the centuries later and some books</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.900" style="s2">weren&#39;t in and then got put in so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.410" end="00:44:22.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an all too human process that got</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.900" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">us these books in the first place but</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:29.420" style="s2">once they were set the believers imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:30.740" style="s2">that you&#39;re stuck with every passage and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.420" end="00:44:33.210" style="s2">there are passages in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.740" end="00:44:35.700" style="s2">that tell you to stone a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.210" end="00:44:36.620" style="s2">or a woman who&#39;s not a virgin on her</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.700" end="00:44:38.670" style="s2">wedding night take her to her father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.620" end="00:44:41.070" style="s2">doorstep and stone her to death right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.670" end="00:44:42.690" style="s2">and where you can probably agree that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.070" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">those are wrong so yeah there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.690" end="00:44:45.810" style="s2">point for greed only you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.250" style="s2">read the book to the end to know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:51.660" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong you can get you can get that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.250" end="00:44:53.250" style="s2">from the paragraph yeah but that is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.660" end="00:44:55.070" style="s2">I said I didn&#39;t say you had to read the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.250" end="00:44:57.720" style="s2">end to the end of the book to those</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.070" end="00:44:59.820" style="s2">related to end you needed to read to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.720" end="00:45:01.380" style="s2">end of the book to contextualize those</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.820" end="00:45:03.540" style="s2">statements within the whole I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.380" end="00:45:06.390" style="s2">there&#39;s no ace culpa Terry there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.540" end="00:45:08.490" style="s2">extra context as to those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.390" end="00:45:09.990" style="s2">statements and that&#39;s there is in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.490" end="00:45:11.640" style="s2">Old Testament there&#39;s a real there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.990" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">real tension and this is I think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.640" end="00:45:14.100" style="s2">tension that would be of interest to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.020" style="s2">is there&#39;s a tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.100" end="00:45:18.210" style="s2">dogmatic and the prophetic traditions</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.020" end="00:45:20.610" style="s2">and I think to the degree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.210" end="00:45:21.990" style="s2">interested in religious phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.610" end="00:45:24.030" style="s2">you find yourself on the side of the</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.030" end="00:45:29.640" style="s2">tradition has implicitly in it what</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.640" end="00:45:34.890" style="s2">of those dogmatic crew those cruelly</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.970" end="00:45:37.770" style="s2">dogmatic rules you see that emerge all</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.890" end="00:45:39.450" style="s2">the time and well arguably in</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.050" end="00:46:43.720" style="s2">well and the revelation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.740" end="00:46:45.400" style="s2">yeah yeah you&#39;re kidding well let that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.720" end="00:46:47.890" style="s2">so that&#39;s a really good objection but</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.400" end="00:46:50.290" style="s2">you know like when I did my lectures on</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.890" end="00:46:52.210" style="s2">the Bible last year I said they provided</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.290" end="00:46:53.470" style="s2">a psychological take on the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.210" end="00:46:56.500" style="s2">lectures and that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.470" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">attempt to maintain here because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.500" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">believe that I&#39;m qualified to make</p>

<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:07.510" style="s2">but you know that that that that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.530" end="00:47:08.830" style="s2">scene that&#39;s that&#39;s delimited out at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.510" end="00:47:11.530" style="s2">end of Revelation so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.830" end="00:47:15.400" style="s2">interesting book read psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.530" end="00:47:17.320" style="s2">because what it anything this is we</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.400" end="00:47:19.030" style="s2">should talk about well let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.320" end="00:47:20.650" style="s2">just let me just address that only take</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.030" end="00:47:23.140" style="s2">a minute to do it and I&#39;ll try to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.650" end="00:47:24.910" style="s2">succinct so there&#39;s an idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.140" end="00:47:26.859" style="s2">expressed in that book is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.910" end="00:47:29.619" style="s2">something like things are always falling</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.859" end="00:47:31.270" style="s2">apart in a fundamental manner it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.619" end="00:47:33.970" style="s2">it&#39;s built into the strut there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.270" end="00:47:36.010" style="s2">apocalyptic element to human life we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.970" end="00:47:38.619" style="s2">fail in small ways and we fail in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.010" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">catastrophic ways and everything that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.619" end="00:47:43.030" style="s2">have we lose and we die so there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:44.859" style="s2">and societies come to an end there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.030" end="00:47:46.839" style="s2">apocalyptic element built into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.859" end="00:47:49.780" style="s2">structure of human reality and part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.839" end="00:47:51.160" style="s2">part of what&#39;s revealed in that strange</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.780" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">book at the end which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.160" end="00:47:55.630" style="s2">hallucinogenic nightmare in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:57.640" style="s2">is that the hero is born at the darkest</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.640" end="00:48:03.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s a psychological truth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.369" end="00:48:05.230" style="s2">very very apt because at the darkest</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.339" end="00:48:07.869" style="s2">point this is also why christ is born</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.230" end="00:48:09.700" style="s2">near near the darkest time of the year</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.869" end="00:48:11.530" style="s2">from from a from a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.700" end="00:48:13.660" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s an idea there that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.530" end="00:48:15.640" style="s2">when things fall apart that&#39;s the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.660" end="00:48:18.550" style="s2">for the birth of the hero and the hero</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.640" end="00:48:20.920" style="s2">in Revelation is also the place where</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.550" end="00:48:22.599" style="s2">free where we&#39;re truthful speech most</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.920" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">clearly manifests itself because in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.599" end="00:48:26.260" style="s2">Christian tradition Christ is identified</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:27.970" style="s2">with truthful speech and so the notion</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:09.930" style="s2">end and for Jesus Jesus to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.930" end="00:52:12.060" style="s2">Savior of it therefore if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.930" end="00:52:15.450" style="s2">you happen to be born a Hindu or born</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.060" end="00:52:17.490" style="s2">Muslim or born a Jew who doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:27.240" style="s2">a strange thing let&#39;s say that one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.080" end="00:52:29.970" style="s2">the things we already agreed on as far</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.240" end="00:52:33.350" style="s2">as I can tell is that the antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.970" end="00:52:35.609" style="s2">pathological dogmatism is is free</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.350" end="00:52:38.340" style="s2">truthful expression something like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.609" end="00:52:40.220" style="s2">is that yeah okay yeah well but one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.340" end="00:52:43.619" style="s2">the things I would say that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.220" end="00:52:45.780" style="s2">crucial to Christianity in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.619" end="00:52:48.090" style="s2">the notion that the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.780" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">redeeming is exactly that and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.090" end="00:52:53.400" style="s2">matter so it&#39;s a universal truth now if</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:55.320" style="s2">we both agree on that the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.400" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">free expression of truthful speech is</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.320" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">the antidote let&#39;s say both denialism</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:01.800" style="s2">and to totalitarianism then the notion</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:04.200" style="s2">that that might be embodied in something</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.800" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">like the word which is truly I think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.200" end="00:53:10.050" style="s2">deepest of Christian ideas is that why</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:12.690" style="s2">is how is that not the same claim now</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.050" end="00:53:13.710" style="s2">let me elaborate it more a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.690" end="00:53:16.140" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.710" end="00:53:18.510" style="s2">or completely so here here&#39;s the strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.140" end="00:53:20.369" style="s2">thing first of all I agree with you by</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.510" end="00:53:23.490" style="s2">the way about the danger of flying off</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.369" end="00:53:24.300" style="s2">the text right about as you move away</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.490" end="00:53:25.890" style="s2">from the text</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.300" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">your interpretation gets less and less</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.890" end="00:53:29.579" style="s2">constrained and I think it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:31.740" style="s2">same danger as move of moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.579" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">the facts which is I think why you want</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.740" end="00:53:35.940" style="s2">to ground values and facts so I get that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.930" end="00:53:38.040" style="s2">argument I think it&#39;s accurate but here</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.940" end="00:53:41.550" style="s2">but here&#39;s here&#39;s something strange is</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.040" end="00:53:43.559" style="s2">that this notion that redemptive that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.550" end="00:53:46.470" style="s2">Redemption is to be found in truthful</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.559" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">speech is actually embodied in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.470" end="00:53:50.970" style="s2">mythology let&#39;s say as a personality and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">not as an idea it&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.970" end="00:53:55.140" style="s2">that you embody and act out it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.910" style="s2">just an idea and that&#39;s why there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.140" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">emphasis on the idea of the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.910" end="00:54:01.619" style="s2">of the word in flesh it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:04.140" style="s2">sophisticated idea I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.619" end="00:54:05.970" style="s2">insanely sophisticated idea so and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.140" end="00:54:10.140" style="s2">will and there&#39;s one more thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.970" end="00:54:11.790" style="s2">okay so look you you you&#39;ve made the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.140" end="00:54:12.809" style="s2">case and I hope we can really get to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.790" end="00:54:14.309" style="s2">this because this is the really tough</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.809" end="00:54:16.859" style="s2">part of our discussion I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.309" end="00:54:20.280" style="s2">you want to ground the world of values</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.859" end="00:54:21.960" style="s2">in something that&#39;s true we could say</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.280" end="00:54:24.990" style="s2">objectively true but let&#39;s just say true</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.960" end="00:54:28.859" style="s2">for a minute and I share that desire but</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:30.630" style="s2">but the problem is is that I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.859" end="00:54:33.869" style="s2">and you actually state this in your book</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.630" end="00:54:35.640" style="s2">I can&#39;t see how you can interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.869" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">world of facts without an a priori</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.640" end="00:54:40.230" style="s2">interpretive structure and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:41.790" style="s2">an old philosophical claim it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.230" end="00:54:44.280" style="s2">unique to me it&#39;s it&#39;s the claim of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.790" end="00:54:46.770" style="s2">conte for example that you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.280" end="00:54:48.660" style="s2">directly from the fact to the value</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.770" end="00:54:50.430" style="s2">because there&#39;s an interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.660" end="00:54:52.920" style="s2">framework that mediates between you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.430" end="00:54:54.210" style="s2">the facts and so first of all I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.920" end="00:54:56.760" style="s2">to know if you accept that proposition</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.210" end="00:54:59.099" style="s2">and then the second question would be if</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.760" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">you do accept the proposition then</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.099" end="00:55:03.750" style="s2">what&#39;s your understanding of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:05.640" style="s2">of the interpretive framework because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.750" end="00:55:08.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s best understood at least in</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.640" end="00:55:11.400" style="s2">part as a personality or as a story for</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.490" end="00:55:16.710" style="s2">that matter so well I think our</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.400" end="00:55:18.150" style="s2">intuition of truth the the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.710" end="00:55:20.819" style="s2">that there&#39;s a difference between fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.150" end="00:55:23.700" style="s2">and fiction or fact and fantasy the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.819" end="00:55:25.870" style="s2">intuition that we are in we live in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.700" end="00:55:28.680" style="s2">relationship to a common reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.870" end="00:55:30.520" style="s2">which our understanding can converge</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.680" end="00:55:33.070" style="s2">provided we&#39;re looking in the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.520" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">direction with the same tools I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.070" end="00:55:40.590" style="s2">that is certainly deeper than religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:43.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not best captured by stories it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.590" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">it even if it even if you could as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.720" end="00:55:48.840" style="s2">matter of historical fact point to its</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:52.060" style="s2">roots in story and myth and religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.840" end="00:55:54.370" style="s2">that&#39;s not an argument that it&#39;s now in</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.060" end="00:55:57.220" style="s2">the 21st century best captured by story</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.370" end="00:56:00.340" style="s2">and myth and religion I think it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.220" end="00:56:04.270" style="s2">a fundamental intuition to which our</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.340" end="00:56:06.970" style="s2">sanity both personally and inter</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.270" end="00:56:11.530" style="s2">subjectively is anchored I mean to lose</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.970" end="00:56:15.000" style="s2">a sense of objective reality is to lose</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.530" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">the the platform on which you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.000" end="00:56:19.600" style="s2">communicate with anyone and or</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:21.850" style="s2">rationally expect anything to happen a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.600" end="00:56:24.130" style="s2">moment from now to think that your</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.850" end="00:56:25.660" style="s2">memory represents something about a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.130" end="00:56:28.660" style="s2">prior state of the world and your</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.660" end="00:56:31.270" style="s2">beliefs represent something about a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.660" end="00:56:33.310" style="s2">possible state in the future all of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.270" end="00:56:36.040" style="s2">is anchored to a sense that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.310" end="00:56:38.380" style="s2">difference between knowing something</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.040" end="00:56:39.910" style="s2">really and just imagining it</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.380" end="00:56:41.800" style="s2">right there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.910" end="00:56:44.140" style="s2">perception and hallucination and all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.800" end="00:56:48.760" style="s2">these distinctions are born of this this</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.140" end="00:56:55.110" style="s2">intuition I think we do have clearly we</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.760" end="00:56:55.110" style="s2">have fundamental intuitions which are</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.350" end="00:57:01.030" style="s2">either impossible to analyze or can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.510" end="00:57:03.190" style="s2">analyzed with respect to only other</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.030" end="00:57:06.910" style="s2">intuitions which we did which we deem</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.190" end="00:57:08.800" style="s2">more rudimentary with upon which</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.910" end="00:57:10.690" style="s2">everything else we do as a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.800" end="00:57:13.630" style="s2">knowledge gathering and sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.690" end="00:57:16.150" style="s2">built so the intuition that 2+2 makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.630" end="00:57:19.270" style="s2">for right you know you at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.150" end="00:57:22.330" style="s2">learn basic arithmetic and you learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.270" end="00:57:24.910" style="s2">what addition is and it&#39;s demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.330" end="00:57:26.860" style="s2">to you with objects and you show it</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.910" end="00:57:28.210" style="s2">you&#39;re shown you take two apples and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.860" end="00:57:32.320" style="s2">take two more apples and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.210" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">four apples look just count them the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.320" end="00:57:37.150" style="s2">intuition that that can be generalized</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:38.420" style="s2">to any four objects right that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.150" end="00:57:42.310" style="s2">just a fact about</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.420" end="00:57:46.130" style="s2">right this is something that we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.310" end="00:57:47.900" style="s2">clearly designed to have there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.130" end="00:57:49.700" style="s2">places where it might break down right</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.900" end="00:57:51.500" style="s2">they might break down and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.700" end="00:57:54.920" style="s2">quantum level it might break down and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.500" end="00:57:57.470" style="s2">areas where our intuitions fail we</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.920" end="00:57:59.210" style="s2">recognize those failures in science and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.470" end="00:58:01.910" style="s2">mathematics by recourse to other</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.210" end="00:58:04.130" style="s2">intuitions which again are unanalyzed</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.910" end="00:58:05.630" style="s2">able but so there is just this fact that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.130" end="00:58:08.120" style="s2">we do pull ourselves up by our</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.630" end="00:58:09.770" style="s2">bootstraps hmm and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.120" end="00:58:11.300" style="s2">embarrassing okay so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.770" end="00:58:13.610" style="s2">difference between what&#39;s that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.300" end="00:58:16.820" style="s2">not trying to trap you here seriously</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.610" end="00:58:19.820" style="s2">not so so there might be mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.820" end="00:58:22.130" style="s2">intuitions a priori let&#39;s say Kant</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.820" end="00:58:24.800" style="s2">identified time and spaces in a prior</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.130" end="00:58:26.930" style="s2">intuitions but I think there&#39;s a third</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.800" end="00:58:29.390" style="s2">category of a prior intuitions that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.930" end="00:58:30.860" style="s2">in fact stories or their personalities</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.390" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">or stories so let me give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.860" end="00:58:38.180" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna do a quick rereading of the</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.180" end="00:58:42.410" style="s2">about GE moore&#39;s argument of infinite</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.220" end="00:58:43.640" style="s2">regress if you claim that something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.410" end="00:58:45.770" style="s2">good and you equate it with something</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.640" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">you can also ask infinitely why the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.770" end="00:58:50.120" style="s2">thing you&#39;re equating it with is good</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">now it seems to me that the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.120" end="00:58:54.710" style="s2">step out of that argument and correct me</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:57.650" style="s2">if I&#39;m wrong here is you tell this you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.710" end="00:58:59.600" style="s2">tell us you tell a story I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.650" end="00:59:01.640" style="s2">to be smart about that you tell two</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.600" end="00:59:03.020" style="s2">stories you tell a story about someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.640" end="00:59:05.840" style="s2">who has an absolutely terrible life</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.020" end="00:59:07.130" style="s2">there in a in a jungle where nature is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.840" end="00:59:08.630" style="s2">trying to kill them all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.130" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">well they&#39;re trying to be killed by</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.630" end="00:59:11.810" style="s2">nature while nature is trying to kill</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:13.700" style="s2">them all the time horrible barbaric</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.810" end="00:59:16.030" style="s2">thugs are making their life miserable in</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.700" end="00:59:20.090" style="s2">every possible way okay so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.030" end="00:59:22.340" style="s2">poll let&#39;s say and then another poll you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.090" end="00:59:23.780" style="s2">identify and these are hypotheticals so</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.340" end="00:59:24.950" style="s2">I guess they&#39;re fictions that&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.780" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">of thinking about it even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.950" end="00:59:29.300" style="s2">extracted from real situations they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:30.650" style="s2">there they&#39;re met have fictions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.300" end="00:59:32.630" style="s2">meta truths that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.650" end="00:59:34.190" style="s2">thinking about it you contrast a good</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.630" end="00:59:36.530" style="s2">life and you know that&#39;s a life where</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.190" end="00:59:38.840" style="s2">the person has enough to eat and enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.530" end="00:59:40.130" style="s2">shelter and you know they have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.840" end="00:59:42.410" style="s2">things that you would expect people to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.130" end="00:59:44.900" style="s2">want you say this is a bad life and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.410" end="00:59:47.150" style="s2">say this is a good life and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.900" end="00:59:48.740" style="s2">you say that&#39;s and then you make a side</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.150" end="00:59:51.010" style="s2">move which I would say is that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.740" end="00:59:52.810" style="s2">objectively verifiable fact</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.010" end="00:59:55.300" style="s2">I would say I don&#39;t think it is an</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.810" end="00:59:57.970" style="s2">objectively verifiable fact I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.300" end="00:59:59.320" style="s2">a fundamental moral claim and I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.970" end="01:00:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where you put your stake in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.320" end="01:00:04.150" style="s2">ground and I would say when I read that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.360" end="01:00:06.910" style="s2">I thought well if you take your jungle</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.150" end="01:00:10.210" style="s2">story which you&#39;ve extracted from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.910" end="01:00:11.890" style="s2">bunch of Horrors and compiled and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.210" end="01:00:13.900" style="s2">take your positive story which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.890" end="01:00:17.710" style="s2">extracted from a bunch of horrors or a</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.900" end="01:00:20.050" style="s2">bunch of quasi utopias let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.710" end="01:00:23.290" style="s2">compiled you&#39;re two-thirds of the way to</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.050" end="01:00:25.330" style="s2">a landscape of Hell in heaven right well</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.290" end="01:00:26.980" style="s2">so then why not continue the abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.330" end="01:00:29.020" style="s2">and say look what we&#39;re really trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.980" end="01:00:30.580" style="s2">avoid here is hell</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.020" end="01:00:32.530" style="s2">oh yeah we&#39;re really trying to move</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.580" end="01:00:33.910" style="s2">towards this heaven yeah but oh yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.530" end="01:00:36.070" style="s2">well no as soon as we do that you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.910" end="01:00:44.350" style="s2">name it just landscape no but my name</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.070" end="01:00:51.310" style="s2">for hell is it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.350" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">because like we&#39;re talking about this at</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.310" end="01:00:56.050" style="s2">dinner we&#39;re talking about this at</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">dinner and how that would be the overlap</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.050" end="01:01:00.730" style="s2">or lack of overlap between our audiences</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:03.150" style="s2">and so like I just heard from your</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.730" end="01:01:04.890" style="s2">audience there and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.150" end="01:01:06.840" style="s2">you might have heard from the odd</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.890" end="01:01:10.800" style="s2">convert but but what&#39;s amazing to me is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.840" end="01:01:20.730" style="s2">so like I have to do some work to figure</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.800" end="01:01:22.500" style="s2">out what point they think you made and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.730" end="01:01:24.270" style="s2">said if you&#39;re gonna produce a fiction</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.500" end="01:01:28.020" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t go right to the end okay so</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.270" end="01:01:30.420" style="s2">did produce a fiction it&#39;s you you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.020" end="01:01:32.520" style="s2">tell stories by way of communicating</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.420" end="01:01:35.220" style="s2">certain ideas I mean that&#39;s obviously so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.520" end="01:01:38.790" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying stories aren&#39;t incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.220" end="01:01:40.590" style="s2">powerful and useful and inevitable right</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.790" end="01:01:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like we we you wait I think you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.590" end="01:01:44.310" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying you might not be</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.630" end="01:01:46.350" style="s2">saying that they&#39;re that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.310" end="01:01:48.900" style="s2">no they&#39;re not inevitable but you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.350" end="01:01:50.850" style="s2">debating their utility and power because</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.900" end="01:01:53.820" style="s2">you know you said that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.850" end="01:01:55.590" style="s2">this story as an intermediate now we</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.820" end="01:01:57.120" style="s2">have a few doors open here which I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.590" end="01:01:58.650" style="s2">we should okay we should extract the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.120" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">most out of these areas that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.650" end="01:02:05.130" style="s2">touched and not run on something else oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:07.050" style="s2">okay I I think there&#39;s two talked about</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.130" end="01:02:10.830" style="s2">the utility of story right which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.050" end="01:02:12.420" style="s2">obviously a fact about the world about</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.830" end="01:02:14.340" style="s2">human psychology that you&#39;re reading a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.420" end="01:02:16.380" style="s2">lot into and more into that I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.340" end="01:02:19.350" style="s2">right and the people we just heard from</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.380" end="01:02:21.930" style="s2">love that you well maybe I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.350" end="01:02:25.040" style="s2">more into it than you are but you talk a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.930" end="01:02:27.330" style="s2">lot about the primacy of stories and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.040" end="01:02:30.150" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get me to admit that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.330" end="01:02:33.710" style="s2">they are that I even I helplessly resort</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.150" end="01:02:36.270" style="s2">to storytelling to make my points right</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.710" end="01:02:37.980" style="s2">well you think I think this is a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.270" end="01:02:39.060" style="s2">place for us to it and I don&#39;t want us</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.980" end="01:02:41.370" style="s2">to get bogged down but I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.060" end="01:02:43.950" style="s2">good place for us to touch this topic of</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.370" end="01:02:46.170" style="s2">the distinction between literal and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.950" end="01:02:47.730" style="s2">metaphorical truth what you I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.170" end="01:02:50.760" style="s2">might want to introduce it but I because</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.730" end="01:02:53.390" style="s2">that in my mind that covers this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.760" end="01:02:57.330" style="s2">different emphasis on stories okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.390" end="01:03:00.000" style="s2">briefly but we are we are at we are at</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.330" end="01:03:03.240" style="s2">60 minutes and we had read to go an hour</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.000" end="01:03:05.120" style="s2">and 15 before we start QA so I agree</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.240" end="01:03:08.580" style="s2">that metaphorical truth is relevant here</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.120" end="01:03:10.920" style="s2">metaphorical truth is my argument that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.580" end="01:03:13.290" style="s2">there are some things which are</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.920" end="01:03:14.700" style="s2">literally false but if you behave as if</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.290" end="01:03:16.410" style="s2">they were true you come out</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.700" end="01:03:17.849" style="s2">ahead of where you would if you behaved</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.410" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">according to the fact that they are</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.849" end="01:03:22.530" style="s2">false and so that these things hover in</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:27.500" style="s2">a kind of intermediate space to call</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.530" end="01:03:30.390" style="s2">them false is incorrect right and I hear</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.500" end="01:03:32.550" style="s2">Jordan wanted to call them true because</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.390" end="01:03:34.530" style="s2">they&#39;re so useful right but you also</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.550" end="01:03:36.750" style="s2">call look this is what happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.530" end="01:03:38.520" style="s2">moral landscape I think tell me that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.750" end="01:03:40.680" style="s2">tell me why I&#39;m wrong because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.520" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">trying to understand it see I think you</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.680" end="01:03:46.380" style="s2">dealt with GE Moore&#39;s problem of</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:47.940" style="s2">infinite regress by by staking a moral</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.380" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">proposition and your moral proposition</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.940" end="01:03:52.920" style="s2">was look here&#39;s a way things can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:55.290" style="s2">horrible and here&#39;s the way things can</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.920" end="01:03:57.119" style="s2">be good can we accept that this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.290" end="01:03:59.160" style="s2">horrible and this is good and that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.119" end="01:04:02.849" style="s2">should move towards good and if the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.160" end="01:04:04.320" style="s2">answer is yes we can accept that then we</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.849" end="01:04:06.450" style="s2">can proceed and maybe we can even</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.320" end="01:04:08.609" style="s2">proceed with extracting values from</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.450" end="01:04:11.339" style="s2">facts but we have to accept that a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.609" end="01:04:13.079" style="s2">priori presupposition first and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.339" end="01:04:15.510" style="s2">insist that we have to accept it because</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.079" end="01:04:17.099" style="s2">it&#39;s objectively true and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.510" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly so so the limit is get</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.099" end="01:04:22.950" style="s2">that proposition clear so my argument is</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.500" end="01:04:26.490" style="s2">that the worst possible misery for</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.950" end="01:04:29.550" style="s2">everyone is bad that&#39;s hell okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.490" end="01:04:32.220" style="s2">so so hell is is the religious version</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.550" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">of that but I&#39;m just you can forget</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.220" end="01:04:35.130" style="s2">about religion or whether there&#39;s a God</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.230" style="s2">or anything else that we live in a</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.230" end="01:04:43.079" style="s2">of experience I&#39;m asking you to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.599" end="01:04:45.650" style="s2">a universe where every conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.079" end="01:04:49.020" style="s2">every mind that can have an experience</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.109" end="01:05:02.220" style="s2">much as it possibly can for as long as</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.910" end="01:05:05.130" style="s2">it can now that includes human beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.220" end="01:05:07.470" style="s2">includes animals and includes the future</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.130" end="01:05:10.619" style="s2">AI that we might build that can suffer</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.470" end="01:05:15.510" style="s2">it includes beings that we&#39;ll never know</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.619" end="01:05:19.290" style="s2">about right so my argument is that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.510" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">if anything is bad that&#39;s bad okay we</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.290" end="01:05:22.779" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree that the hell is bad if</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:26.019" style="s2">the word bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.779" end="01:05:29.169" style="s2">is going to mean anything that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.019" end="01:05:31.779" style="s2">you can&#39;t say that&#39;s fine but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.169" end="01:05:33.999" style="s2">factual no it is it&#39;s a factory it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.779" end="01:05:35.769" style="s2">claim about so I would argue to you and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.999" end="01:05:37.419" style="s2">again if this it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to impart</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.769" end="01:05:39.249" style="s2">this intuition if someone doesn&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.419" end="01:05:42.039" style="s2">it but if someone doesn&#39;t share this</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.249" end="01:05:44.380" style="s2">intuition I have no way of interpreting</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.039" end="01:05:46.839" style="s2">any other other word that comes out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.380" end="01:05:48.849" style="s2">their mouth after they admit they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.839" end="01:05:50.169" style="s2">share this so episode just imagine</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.849" end="01:05:54.819" style="s2">someone saying and that doesn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.169" end="01:05:59.559" style="s2">a factual claim so again you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.819" end="01:06:00.459" style="s2">gonna get stuck here and I think give us</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.559" end="01:06:02.619" style="s2">give us one more minute</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.459" end="01:06:04.359" style="s2">okay one more minute because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.619" end="01:06:07.209" style="s2">think we&#39;ll get stuck here every claim</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.359" end="01:06:10.239" style="s2">every claim we make about anything at a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.209" end="01:06:12.249" style="s2">certain point if you trace all the tools</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.239" end="01:06:14.229" style="s2">were using down to you know Turtles all</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.249" end="01:06:16.539" style="s2">the way down to something that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.229" end="01:06:18.039" style="s2">explain and justify right this is true</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.539" end="01:06:21.549" style="s2">of physics it&#39;s true of mathematics I</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.039" end="01:06:23.289" style="s2">just said it was true of arithmetic good</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.549" end="01:06:24.519" style="s2">ole proved it&#39;s true of arithmetic I</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.289" end="01:06:26.859" style="s2">mean there&#39;s that we have intuitions of</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.519" end="01:06:30.789" style="s2">truth that can&#39;t be cashed out by</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.859" end="01:06:33.880" style="s2">recourse to the system itself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.789" end="01:06:36.549" style="s2">true morally I would argue in this sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.880" end="01:06:38.409" style="s2">that yes the worst possible misery for</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.549" end="01:06:42.369" style="s2">everyone is bad and if you&#39;re gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.409" end="01:06:45.130" style="s2">well okay well who knows maybe it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.369" end="01:06:47.319" style="s2">what I had what does that mean what a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.130" end="01:06:52.209" style="s2">bad means bad again you guys are gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.319" end="01:06:53.799" style="s2">get stuck okay what does bad I really I</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.209" end="01:06:55.959" style="s2">really think that we&#39;re gonna go down a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.799" end="01:06:58.209" style="s2">rabbit hole here okay this is a crucial</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.959" end="01:06:59.140" style="s2">issue that should absolutely why you get</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.209" end="01:07:01.989" style="s2">stuck</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.140" end="01:07:04.059" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re putting our we have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.989" end="01:07:06.309" style="s2">mutiny here we&#39;re at war with our</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.059" end="01:07:10.299" style="s2">moderator yes give us two more minutes</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.309" end="01:07:12.489" style="s2">because okay all so so so let me but let</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.299" end="01:07:14.289" style="s2">what I mean honestly by the way I have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.489" end="01:07:17.890" style="s2">prediction that in here two minutes we</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.289" end="01:07:19.589" style="s2">won&#39;t be any further okay let&#39;s bet I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.890" end="01:07:21.700" style="s2">bet you a bet you a dollar</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.589" end="01:07:23.650" style="s2">you&#39;re literally playing devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.700" end="01:07:28.150" style="s2">advocate here because you don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.650" end="01:07:30.549" style="s2">that it&#39;s that hell might be good no of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.150" end="01:07:34.119" style="s2">course okay I didn&#39;t say that so you</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.549" end="01:07:36.220" style="s2">agree that it&#39;s bad this isn&#39;t I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.119" end="01:07:39.009" style="s2">argue that anything you would if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.220" end="01:07:41.440" style="s2">going to use the word bad and good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.009" end="01:07:44.289" style="s2">or better and worse or anything any make</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.440" end="01:07:46.720" style="s2">any value judgment about anything it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.289" end="01:07:48.190" style="s2">will implicit in those judgments will be</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.720" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">an acknowledgment whether you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.190" end="01:07:52.210" style="s2">to acknowledge it or not when I put the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">question to you that the worst possible</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.210" end="01:07:58.569" style="s2">misery for everyone is bad you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:00.609" style="s2">the word bad unless you&#39;re disagreeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.569" end="01:08:03.609" style="s2">in the least about that okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.609" end="01:08:05.890" style="s2">built into your good and bad in with</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.609" end="01:08:08.170" style="s2">respect to every other situation in life</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.890" end="01:08:09.789" style="s2">fine you know like you know if you if</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.170" end="01:08:12.130" style="s2">you&#39;re going home tomorrow and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.789" end="01:08:15.569" style="s2">you know a bus drives by and cuts your</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.130" end="01:08:18.429" style="s2">hand off and you say well that was bad</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.569" end="01:08:20.619" style="s2">it only makes sense with reference to</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.429" end="01:08:22.810" style="s2">this underlying claim well it would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.619" end="01:08:24.670" style="s2">worse if the other hand got cut off too</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.810" end="01:08:26.109" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s hands got cut off you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.670" end="01:08:28.779" style="s2">beating a dead horse here man I agree</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.109" end="01:08:31.270" style="s2">with you so I&#39;m saying that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.779" end="01:08:32.650" style="s2">assumes this whether they whether they</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.270" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">claim to or not</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.650" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">okay okay and so and so to say and this</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:40.150" style="s2">is this is how I bring GE Moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:41.859" style="s2">argument to end yeah he says his</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.150" end="01:08:44.350" style="s2">argument depends on it being</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.859" end="01:08:49.389" style="s2">intelligible at that point to say well</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.350" end="01:08:52.299" style="s2">is that really bad is it really bad okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.389" end="01:08:54.569" style="s2">well what would really bad be if if the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.299" end="01:08:57.219" style="s2">worst possible misery for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.569" end="01:09:00.069" style="s2">didn&#39;t get you there right that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.219" end="01:09:02.290" style="s2">no there&#39;s no other space to occupy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.069" end="01:09:04.299" style="s2">also not disputing the utility of your</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.290" end="01:09:06.250" style="s2">move to bring GE Moore&#39;s infinite</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.299" end="01:09:07.330" style="s2">regress to an end I&#39;m disputing</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.250" end="01:09:09.460" style="s2">something very specific</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.330" end="01:09:11.710" style="s2">I&#39;m disputing the issue that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.460" end="01:09:12.489" style="s2">factual claim that&#39;s all well you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.710" end="01:09:14.589" style="s2">is bad</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.489" end="01:09:16.749" style="s2">is we should avoid it it brings mores</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.589" end="01:09:18.549" style="s2">infinite regress to an end all of that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.749" end="01:09:22.269" style="s2">agree it&#39;s deeper than a factual claim</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.549" end="01:09:24.999" style="s2">it&#39;s just a claim about the is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.269" end="01:09:28.029" style="s2">claim that is required to make any value</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.999" end="01:09:30.219" style="s2">judgment intelligible right any value</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.029" end="01:09:31.960" style="s2">judgment so it&#39;s like it&#39;s not an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.219" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">not an arithmetic all claim so an</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.960" end="01:09:38.980" style="s2">aeromedical claim about addition in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:41.109" style="s2">case is is now you could say you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.980" end="01:09:43.210" style="s2">say the same thing you could say when I</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.109" end="01:09:45.779" style="s2">say two plus two makes four you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.210" end="01:09:48.219" style="s2">say but is that a factual claim and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.779" end="01:09:49.960" style="s2">there&#39;s some way of jiggering the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.219" end="01:09:51.069" style="s2">you talk about facts with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.960" end="01:09:52.480" style="s2">mathematics where I could say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.069" end="01:09:54.130" style="s2">not a factual claim but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.480" end="01:09:56.230" style="s2">arithmetic alene it&#39;s a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.130" end="01:09:59.530" style="s2">claim well I&#39;m also not trying to just</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.230" end="01:10:02.380" style="s2">don&#39;t see you need to eyes or yep</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.530" end="01:10:05.380" style="s2">fine what I&#39;m trying to do is to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.380" end="01:10:06.820" style="s2">I&#39;m really trying to do we need see the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.380" end="01:10:09.309" style="s2">the the problem I have with your</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.820" end="01:10:12.249" style="s2">argument and this isn&#39;t I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.309" end="01:10:13.809" style="s2">that you&#39;re wrong I see what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.249" end="01:10:16.360" style="s2">doing and I see why you&#39;re doing it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.809" end="01:10:18.340" style="s2">as far as I can tell it&#39;s laudable but</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.360" end="01:10:19.449" style="s2">for the problem is is that as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.340" end="01:10:20.980" style="s2">can tell there&#39;s problems it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.449" end="01:10:22.690" style="s2">solve and there&#39;s other problems that</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.980" end="01:10:25.539" style="s2">leaves on address that don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.690" end="01:10:27.880" style="s2">unsolved or unaddressed and so and one</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.539" end="01:10:30.219" style="s2">of the problems is this problem of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.880" end="01:10:32.380" style="s2">intermediary interpretive structure and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.219" end="01:10:34.570" style="s2">you you already said we need intuitions</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.380" end="01:10:36.579" style="s2">to guide our our interrelationship with</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.570" end="01:10:38.739" style="s2">facts because we&#39;ve already agreed on</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.579" end="01:10:40.780" style="s2">that so the question is what are the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.739" end="01:10:43.030" style="s2">nature of these intuitions and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.780" end="01:10:45.219" style="s2">saying some of those intuitions take the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.030" end="01:10:46.570" style="s2">place of stories take the form of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.219" end="01:10:48.760" style="s2">stories but even more than that</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.570" end="01:10:50.860" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna go after the hell thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.760" end="01:10:52.929" style="s2">again okay because you said well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.860" end="01:10:54.909" style="s2">bad and you made sure that I also agree</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.929" end="01:10:56.949" style="s2">with that which I do I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.909" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">and then it&#39;s a point of profound</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.949" end="01:11:00.820" style="s2">agreement between you and I like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:03.130" style="s2">spent my entire life trying to</p>

<p begin="01:11:03.130" end="01:11:07.269" style="s2">things they could possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.170" end="01:11:09.789" style="s2">in the service of their dogmatic beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.269" end="01:11:11.949" style="s2">and so I think that that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.789" end="01:11:14.289" style="s2">seriously and I&#39;m no fan of moral</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.949" end="01:11:16.869" style="s2">relativism so we&#39;re on this we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.289" end="01:11:18.969" style="s2">same page there now but what I noticed</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.869" end="01:11:21.159" style="s2">it in when you wrote the moral landscape</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.969" end="01:11:24.280" style="s2">is you you tell it and I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.159" end="01:11:25.870" style="s2">trap you you you tell a story about</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.280" end="01:11:27.670" style="s2">it looks to me like it&#39;s a story about</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.870" end="01:11:29.410" style="s2">heaven versus hell essentially let me</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.670" end="01:11:31.540" style="s2">use that language momentarily but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.410" end="01:11:34.270" style="s2">also a story about good versus evil and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.540" end="01:11:38.380" style="s2">this is why it&#39;s because the question is</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.270" end="01:11:41.530" style="s2">what&#39;s bad about Hell now you say the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.380" end="01:11:45.460" style="s2">suffering it&#39;s like fair enough man true</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.530" end="01:11:49.290" style="s2">enough but not true but not true enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.460" end="01:11:52.690" style="s2">so in what&#39;s what&#39;s also bad about Hell</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.290" end="01:11:54.550" style="s2">in addition to the suffering the actions</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.690" end="01:11:56.740" style="s2">that put you there the malevolence that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.550" end="01:11:58.600" style="s2">generates okay with that that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.740" end="01:12:00.670" style="s2">the suffering so I mean oh no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.600" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same as the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.670" end="01:12:04.630" style="s2">suffering it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the having</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:06.910" style="s2">your hand cut off it&#39;s the pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.630" end="01:12:10.690" style="s2">that&#39;s derived by the person who cut it</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.910" end="01:12:13.030" style="s2">off that&#39;s more so but that&#39;s part of my</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.690" end="01:12:15.280" style="s2">picture well but wait it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.030" end="01:12:17.530" style="s2">the distinction the distinction is</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.280" end="01:12:19.080" style="s2">important but also my my depiction but</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.530" end="01:12:21.570" style="s2">Jordan my picture of the moral landscape</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:25.570" style="s2">includes all of this it includes</p>

<p begin="01:14:17.570" end="01:14:23.120" style="s2">start with you Sam let&#39;s swap out the</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.840" end="01:14:26.960" style="s2">idea of metaphorical truth for something</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.120" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">a little harder headed heuristics right</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.960" end="01:14:31.580" style="s2">we have heuristics we use them to</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:34.370" style="s2">perceive the world they&#39;re often highly</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.580" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">reliable in fact almost everything that</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.370" end="01:14:39.770" style="s2">you believe that lets you operate has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.520" end="01:14:42.350" style="s2">be a heuristic of some kind I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.770" end="01:14:44.390" style="s2">you decided to learn to drive and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.350" end="01:14:46.820" style="s2">got into the car and they said okay well</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.390" end="01:14:48.980" style="s2">it&#39;s all quarks out there right you need</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.980" end="01:14:52.940" style="s2">each other not useful right not useful</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.870" end="01:14:54.560" style="s2">right what you need are some heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.940" end="01:14:56.390" style="s2">in which you can stipulate that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.560" end="01:14:57.650" style="s2">something called a vehicle out there and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.390" end="01:14:58.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be overly precise</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.650" end="01:15:01.700" style="s2">about what it is and you learn to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.970" end="01:15:03.680" style="s2">it okay the heuristics vary a lot in</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.700" end="01:15:06.710" style="s2">quality some of them are really good the</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.680" end="01:15:09.350" style="s2">periodic tables are really good okay the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.710" end="01:15:12.520" style="s2">idea of gravitational potential energy</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.350" end="01:15:15.260" style="s2">is kind of crappy right if I have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.520" end="01:15:17.060" style="s2">phone on a table here I can tell you how</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.260" end="01:15:18.620" style="s2">much potential energy it has by</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.620" end="01:15:22.220" style="s2">the ground but if I&#39;ve got a whole one</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.630" end="01:15:23.480" style="s2">depth on one side of the table and</p>

<p begin="01:15:23.780" end="01:15:27.490" style="s2">I can&#39;t calculate it because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.250" end="01:15:29.750" style="s2">crappy heuristic works well enough in</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.490" end="01:15:33.830" style="s2">regular stuff right now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.750" end="01:15:37.130" style="s2">question what if these religious texts</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.830" end="01:15:39.500" style="s2">are heuristics through which most people</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.130" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">simplify calculations that they are in</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.500" end="01:15:43.340" style="s2">no position to do based on the limited</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:44.870" style="s2">amount that they are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.340" end="01:15:46.370" style="s2">perceiving the amount that they</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.370" end="01:15:50.810" style="s2">play so they&#39;re deploying these</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.960" end="01:15:54.080" style="s2">heuristics maybe to redo</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.810" end="01:15:56.680" style="s2">things that degrade well-being if it</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:59.180" style="s2">were true that religious heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.680" end="01:16:02.240" style="s2">increased well-being by allowing people</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.180" end="01:16:04.010" style="s2">to actually on average operate in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.240" end="01:16:06.050" style="s2">world in a way that that increased</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.010" end="01:16:08.690" style="s2">well-being what would you say about them</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.050" end="01:16:11.570" style="s2">that well I would worry much less about</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.690" end="01:16:13.400" style="s2">them obviously and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.570" end="01:16:15.950" style="s2">treat all religions equally and their</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.400" end="01:16:18.590" style="s2">religions I literally never think about</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.950" end="01:16:21.260" style="s2">because I&#39;m not seeing the daily</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.590" end="01:16:24.460" style="s2">casualties of those belief systems so</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.260" end="01:16:26.720" style="s2">but you say that as people get away from</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.460" end="01:16:28.370" style="s2">fundamental versions of these things and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.720" end="01:16:30.380" style="s2">I&#39;m not advocating for fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.370" end="01:16:32.120" style="s2">here which you say yourself as people</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.380" end="01:16:34.040" style="s2">get away from the fundamental versions</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.120" end="01:16:36.710" style="s2">of these things things tend to go</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.040" end="01:16:40.460" style="s2">haywire and so in its in essence what</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.710" end="01:16:42.680" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is well we tend to go</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.460" end="01:16:44.180" style="s2">haywire in what sense well I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.680" end="01:16:46.400" style="s2">was in term multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.180" end="01:16:48.530" style="s2">interpretations right well yeah but so</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:50.150" style="s2">people are in that&#39;s the researchers</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.530" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">better or heuristics and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.150" end="01:16:55.960" style="s2">pressure is some of these heuristics are</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:58.130" style="s2">obviously so bad that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.960" end="01:17:01.340" style="s2">civilizational pressure to find better</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.130" end="01:17:03.290" style="s2">interpretations and but you said that</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.340" end="01:17:03.740" style="s2">the fundamentalists have an advantage</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.290" end="01:17:06.020" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.740" end="01:17:10.490" style="s2">what is that advantage because if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.020" end="01:17:11.990" style="s2">just go back to the text and say listen</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.490" end="01:17:14.900" style="s2">I just want to I want to understand what</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.990" end="01:17:17.380" style="s2">these words mean right you get at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.900" end="01:17:22.100" style="s2">first pass the literal interpretation</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.980" end="01:17:59.150" style="s2">but but the basic point is to say that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.450" end="01:18:01.190" style="s2">the fundamentalists have an advantage is</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.150" end="01:18:03.920" style="s2">to acknowledge something funky</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.190" end="01:18:05.330" style="s2">about those stories which I&#39;m claiming</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.920" end="01:18:08.060" style="s2">are going to be some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.330" end="01:18:09.860" style="s2">evolutionary heuristic for living a life</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.060" end="01:18:11.540" style="s2">though that mayhem defensible they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.860" end="01:18:14.930" style="s2">you know they have an event it&#39;s not an</p>

<p begin="01:18:35.000" end="01:18:39.350" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s totally straightforward it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.190" end="01:18:41.660" style="s2">like the advantages listen that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.350" end="01:18:44.030" style="s2">people spend a lot of time lying to you</p>

<p begin="01:19:00.590" end="01:19:06.410" style="s2">just it&#39;s clear when it says sacrifice a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.590" end="01:19:08.270" style="s2">goat goat means goat right like you</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.410" end="01:19:09.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do something else to make</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.270" end="01:19:11.960" style="s2">goat means having nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.980" end="01:19:15.560" style="s2">goat right and so that it&#39;s it&#39;s an ace</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.960" end="01:19:18.230" style="s2">it&#39;s an asymmetric war of if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.560" end="01:19:20.750" style="s2">gonna try to make your dogmas more and</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.230" end="01:19:23.120" style="s2">more palatable by importing stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.750" end="01:19:25.220" style="s2">clearly was never even in the worldview</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.120" end="01:19:27.770" style="s2">of anyone who birthed these religions</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.220" end="01:19:31.010" style="s2">you&#39;re playing you&#39;re not doing that</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.770" end="01:19:33.350" style="s2">because you want to live even more by</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.010" end="01:19:36.110" style="s2">God&#39;s Word no you found some of God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.350" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">words unacceptable right and that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.110" end="01:19:39.590" style="s2">every spunda Mentalist can sniff that</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:41.450" style="s2">out and they&#39;re right to sniff it out</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.590" end="01:19:45.320" style="s2">because in fact either it is in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.450" end="01:19:47.750" style="s2">motivation okay good so I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.320" end="01:19:49.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a tenuous kind of agreement</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.750" end="01:19:51.560" style="s2">that there might be some kind of utility</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.820" end="01:19:53.990" style="s2">that that utility might be morally</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.560" end="01:19:56.030" style="s2">questionable sometimes but that there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.990" end="01:19:57.980" style="s2">some reason that people would resort to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.030" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">a fundamental simple interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.980" end="01:20:01.670" style="s2">because as they depart from that</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:03.290" style="s2">interpretation things get more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.670" end="01:20:05.120" style="s2">and it creates some kind of disadvantage</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.290" end="01:20:06.680" style="s2">well the part of the problem with that</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.120" end="01:20:08.540" style="s2">would be that as you move away from the</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.680" end="01:20:09.950" style="s2">text you you fractionate the moral</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.540" end="01:20:12.920" style="s2">belief system and you end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.950" end="01:20:13.880" style="s2">nihilistic situation so as you move away</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.920" end="01:20:15.710" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.880" end="01:20:17.780" style="s2">avant ism you move towards the parallel</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.710" end="01:20:19.909" style="s2">danger which is moral relativism and</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.780" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">nihilism and so hopefully you can find</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.909" end="01:20:23.270" style="s2">some balance so let me ask you know I</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:25.909" style="s2">want to ask you a question</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.270" end="01:20:28.040" style="s2">oh yes okay and also what time do we</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.909" end="01:20:31.070" style="s2">actually start this party it&#39;s 10:00 I</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.040" end="01:20:32.679" style="s2">just missed the time card but I think we</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.070" end="01:20:35.719" style="s2">have another couple of minutes okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.679" end="01:20:39.050" style="s2">so there&#39;s no objective reality at a</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.719" end="01:20:40.520" style="s2">time I think hahaha actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.050" end="01:20:47.420" style="s2">pretty good conversation we could have</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.520" end="01:20:51.199" style="s2">but so here&#39;s my question for you is if</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.420" end="01:20:55.909" style="s2">we agree that there is some way in which</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.199" end="01:20:58.010" style="s2">religious texts carry some kind of value</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.909" end="01:20:59.989" style="s2">because they allow people to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.010" end="01:21:02.540" style="s2">how to navigate their lives in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.989" end="01:21:03.949" style="s2">might reduce suffering reduce the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.540" end="01:21:08.060" style="s2">complexity of the choices that they have</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.949" end="01:21:09.949" style="s2">to make presumably you will agree that</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.060" end="01:21:11.750" style="s2">that would be consistent with an</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.949" end="01:21:15.260" style="s2">evolutionary interpretation that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.750" end="01:21:17.510" style="s2">fact that the stories themselves are yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.260" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">functional would provide an advantage to</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.510" end="01:21:22.880" style="s2">those who were deploying them yes so</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:25.850" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem isn&#39;t it then also</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.880" end="01:21:28.010" style="s2">true that those stories are responsive</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.850" end="01:21:30.199" style="s2">to past environments and so the claim</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.010" end="01:21:32.420" style="s2">that these things might be timeless</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.199" end="01:21:36.620" style="s2">would be suspect and yes that you would</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.420" end="01:21:38.480" style="s2">expect a spectrum of durability some</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.620" end="01:21:42.199" style="s2">stories would be right in a brief moment</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.480" end="01:21:43.100" style="s2">as okay oh that&#39;s true oh that&#39;s true so</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.199" end="01:21:44.989" style="s2">far so good</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.100" end="01:21:48.020" style="s2">well so far so good this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.989" end="01:21:51.020" style="s2">actually I think quite excellent then</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.020" end="01:21:53.480" style="s2">because what we have is a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.020" end="01:21:56.090" style="s2">that there is something to these belief</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.480" end="01:21:58.340" style="s2">systems that has to do with practical</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.090" end="01:22:00.380" style="s2">realities in the past and we also have</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.340" end="01:22:02.810" style="s2">an acknowledgment that we cannot trust</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.380" end="01:22:05.780" style="s2">in these things based on simple faith</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.810" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">because even if they are can be certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.780" end="01:22:10.340" style="s2">to have worked at some point in the past</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:16.150" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what their relevance is to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.340" end="01:22:16.150" style="s2">the present right okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.579" end="01:22:20.150" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.739" end="01:22:28.300" style="s2">that&#39;s and I would say that&#39;s that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.739" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">things about that that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.300" end="01:22:35.020" style="s2">we&#39;re having this discussion and you see</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.560" end="01:22:38.920" style="s2">what happens in the most profound of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.020" end="01:22:41.560" style="s2">such texts is the idea that the process</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.920" end="01:22:44.290" style="s2">by which your knowledge is updated has</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.560" end="01:22:47.469" style="s2">to occupy a position in the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.290" end="01:22:50.920" style="s2">values that supersedes your reliance or</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.469" end="01:22:52.900" style="s2">Dogma is the fundamental claim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.920" end="01:22:54.700" style="s2">why for example in Christianity the</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.900" end="01:22:56.739" style="s2">notion is is that the word is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.700" end="01:22:58.540" style="s2">highest of values and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.739" end="01:23:00.340" style="s2">embodied word and that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.540" end="01:23:02.380" style="s2">mediates between order and chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.340" end="01:23:04.150" style="s2">everything else has to be subject to</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.380" end="01:23:05.920" style="s2">that and I would say that&#39;s not a claim</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.150" end="01:23:07.180" style="s2">that&#39;s unique to Christianity so for</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.920" end="01:23:09.280" style="s2">example okay no I think I think we I</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.180" end="01:23:10.810" style="s2">think because we&#39;re we were being told</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.280" end="01:23:12.850" style="s2">we&#39;re out of time here so I want to give</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.810" end="01:23:16.020" style="s2">Sam his reaction to that as well and</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.850" end="01:23:16.020" style="s2">then we&#39;ll move on to Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.730" end="01:23:23.620" style="s2">well I&#39;m tempted to just ask Jordan a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.969" end="01:23:25.090" style="s2">question here this it&#39;s hard to know</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.620" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">what to save for tomorrow night but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.090" end="01:23:28.540" style="s2">feel like we&#39;ve got 3,000 people sitting</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:36.390" style="s2">here who would really like an answer to</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.540" end="01:23:39.400" style="s2">this question you say you believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.390" end="01:23:43.060" style="s2">you have been no I say I act as if he</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.400" end="01:23:46.480" style="s2">exists you say what I say I act as if he</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.060" end="01:23:49.560" style="s2">exists so a much more precise claim okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.480" end="01:23:53.620" style="s2">so then what what but in this case what</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.560" end="01:23:55.960" style="s2">fits it so you act as though God exists</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.620" end="01:23:59.170" style="s2">and in addition I&#39;ve heard you say that</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.960" end="01:24:02.770" style="s2">I act as though God exists that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.170" end="01:24:05.820" style="s2">realize so far it&#39;s a yes yes we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.770" end="01:24:05.820" style="s2">that the night is young</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.860" end="01:24:09.040" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.090" end="01:24:14.690" style="s2">so in that sense I&#39;m not really an</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.590" end="01:24:18.920" style="s2">atheist I&#39;ve heard you say this so that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.690" end="01:24:21.469" style="s2">some of you is well if I were really an</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.920" end="01:24:23.179" style="s2">atheist I would be far more poorly</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.469" end="01:24:24.920" style="s2">behaved than in fact I am right I would</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.179" end="01:24:26.630" style="s2">be like we&#39;re Skolnick off committing</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.920" end="01:24:28.070" style="s2">murders and and assuming there was</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.630" end="01:24:31.400" style="s2">nothing wrong with more it would be more</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.070" end="01:24:34.760" style="s2">likely yes yeah okay so so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.400" end="01:24:37.429" style="s2">distinction no more likely what was that</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.760" end="01:24:39.289" style="s2">that&#39;s a big distinction that you would</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.429" end="01:24:40.909" style="s2">is very different than it would be more</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.289" end="01:24:42.170" style="s2">likely taking the safety off the gun</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.909" end="01:24:45.050" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing you&#39;re shooting</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.170" end="01:24:47.079" style="s2">it right yes the temptations laid open</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.050" end="01:24:51.380" style="s2">to Raskolnikov would be more at hand</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.079" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">okay just as they were to him so what in</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.380" end="01:24:58.039" style="s2">that so you know in what sense do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.840" end="01:25:02.659" style="s2">mean well what is the God that you act</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.039" end="01:25:05.119" style="s2">as though he she it exists and what is</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.659" end="01:25:07.670" style="s2">that what what is the God shaped thing I</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.119" end="01:25:11.659" style="s2">must have in my life to prevent me from</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.670" end="01:25:13.400" style="s2">being a quote real atheist well okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.659" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">first of all I have to point out that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.400" end="01:25:16.489" style="s2">there&#39;s no possible way I can answer</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:18.770" style="s2">both those questions in two minutes</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.489" end="01:25:20.570" style="s2">well it&#39;s the same question I mean what</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.770" end="01:25:22.579" style="s2">is it like what what do you mean by God</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.570" end="01:25:26.630" style="s2">okay well I&#39;m going to tell you some of</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.579" end="01:25:28.039" style="s2">the things that I mean by God we do have</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.630" end="01:25:31.780" style="s2">to get the questions we&#39;re gonna do this</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.039" end="01:25:34.760" style="s2">tomorrow maybe this is where we start</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.780" end="01:25:36.829" style="s2">well that was a pretty resentment now it</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.760" end="01:25:38.929" style="s2">seems like that constitutes an audience</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.829" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">question wouldn&#39;t you say I tell you</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.929" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">what I tell you what let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.960" end="01:25:50.310" style="s2">let&#39;s do this but let&#39;s be deliberate</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.690" end="01:25:54.510" style="s2">about time okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.310" end="01:25:56.130" style="s2">okay okay well I&#39;m going to read some</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.510" end="01:25:57.990" style="s2">things that I wrote because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.130" end="01:26:00.000" style="s2">complicated that I&#39;m not sure that I can</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.990" end="01:26:03.390" style="s2">just spin it off the top of my head and</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.000" end="01:26:04.980" style="s2">so you&#39;ll have to excuse me so and what</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.390" end="01:26:07.440" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do is sort of paint a</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.980" end="01:26:10.050" style="s2">picture by by by highlighting different</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.440" end="01:26:12.450" style="s2">things so now I already made one point</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.050" end="01:26:14.250" style="s2">here I mean I made the point that part</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.450" end="01:26:16.740" style="s2">of the conception of God that underlies</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.250" end="01:26:20.130" style="s2">the Western ethos is the notion that</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.740" end="01:26:22.680" style="s2">whatever God is is expressed in truth</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.130" end="01:26:24.870" style="s2">the truthful speech that rectifies</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.680" end="01:26:27.420" style="s2">pathological hierarchies and that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.870" end="01:26:29.670" style="s2">all it does it also confronts the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.420" end="01:26:31.410" style="s2">of being itself and generates habitable</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.670" end="01:26:33.510" style="s2">order that&#39;s a that&#39;s the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.410" end="01:26:35.850" style="s2">proposition and that that&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.510" end="01:26:38.010" style="s2">conceptualized as at least one element</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.850" end="01:26:39.870" style="s2">of God and so I would think about it as</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.010" end="01:26:41.940" style="s2">a transcendent reality that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.870" end="01:26:43.920" style="s2">observable across the longest of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.940" end="01:26:47.000" style="s2">timeframes the longest of iterated time</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.920" end="01:26:49.620" style="s2">frames to your point so so okay so</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.000" end="01:26:51.720" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s some propositions and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.620" end="01:26:53.700" style="s2">they&#39;re complicated and they need to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.720" end="01:26:55.560" style="s2">unpacked so I&#39;m just gonna read them and</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.700" end="01:26:59.370" style="s2">you that&#39;ll have to do for the time</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.560" end="01:27:01.440" style="s2">being so God is how we imaginatively and</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.370" end="01:27:03.780" style="s2">collectively represent the existence and</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.440" end="01:27:05.730" style="s2">action of consciousness across time as</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.780" end="01:27:08.130" style="s2">the most real aspects of existence</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.730" end="01:27:10.040" style="s2">manifest themselves across the longest</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.130" end="01:27:12.390" style="s2">of timeframes but are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.040" end="01:27:14.580" style="s2">apprehensible as objects in the here and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.390" end="01:27:16.290" style="s2">now so what that means in some sense is</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.580" end="01:27:18.000" style="s2">that you have conceptions of reality</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.290" end="01:27:19.230" style="s2">built into your biological and</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.000" end="01:27:21.990" style="s2">metaphysical structure that a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.230" end="01:27:24.090" style="s2">consequence of processes of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.990" end="01:27:27.270" style="s2">that that occurred over unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.090" end="01:27:29.880" style="s2">vast expanses of time and that structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.270" end="01:27:31.680" style="s2">your perception of reality in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.880" end="01:27:33.120" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be structured if you only</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.680" end="01:27:35.070" style="s2">lived for the amount of time that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.120" end="01:27:37.350" style="s2">going to live and that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.070" end="01:27:39.570" style="s2">the problem of deriving values from</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.350" end="01:27:41.820" style="s2">facts because you&#39;re evanescent and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.570" end="01:27:44.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t derive the right values from</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.820" end="01:27:46.530" style="s2">the facts that portray themselves to you</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:48.690" style="s2">in your lifespan which is why you have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.530" end="01:27:51.480" style="s2">biological structure that&#39;s like 3.5</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.690" end="01:27:53.550" style="s2">billion years old so God is that which</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.480" end="01:27:55.860" style="s2">eternally dies and is reborn in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.550" end="01:27:57.280" style="s2">pursuit of higher being and truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.860" end="01:27:59.470" style="s2">a fundamental element of here</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.280" end="01:28:01.420" style="s2">mythology God is the highest value in</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.470" end="01:28:03.580" style="s2">the hierarchy of values that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.420" end="01:28:06.100" style="s2">way of looking at it God is what calls</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.580" end="01:28:08.440" style="s2">and what responds in the eternal call to</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.100" end="01:28:11.260" style="s2">adventure God is the voice of conscience</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.440" end="01:28:14.380" style="s2">God is the source of judgment and mercy</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.260" end="01:28:17.050" style="s2">and guilt God is the future to which we</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.380" end="01:28:19.060" style="s2">make sacrifices and something akin to</p>

<p begin="01:29:04.240" end="01:29:07.990" style="s2">something like the notion of God the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.770" end="01:29:09.790" style="s2">Father it&#39;s also the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.990" end="01:29:12.670" style="s2">makes women men attractive to women</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.790" end="01:29:14.740" style="s2">because men women peel off the top of</p>

<p begin="01:29:14.740" end="01:29:18.610" style="s2">should be at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.850" end="01:29:20.320" style="s2">and the answer right now is tyranny as</p>

<p begin="01:29:20.320" end="01:29:24.460" style="s2">answer is something more like the</p>

<p begin="01:30:31.159" end="01:30:36.830" style="s2">can possibly hear anyone&#39;s prayer is</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.159" end="01:30:38.510" style="s2">much less answer them right and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.830" end="01:30:40.820" style="s2">talked is I&#39;m wondering what percentage</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.510" end="01:30:42.290" style="s2">of religious people who would say oh</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.820" end="01:30:45.320" style="s2">yeah I believe in God and it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.290" end="01:30:47.000" style="s2">important thing in my life what</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.320" end="01:30:48.800" style="s2">percentage of those religious people do</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.000" end="01:30:50.900" style="s2">you think have in mind a God of the sort</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.800" end="01:30:52.670" style="s2">you just described I don&#39;t know Sam it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.900" end="01:30:55.130" style="s2">a good question because when I go talk</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.670" end="01:30:57.020" style="s2">to people would I when I talk to people</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.130" end="01:30:59.780" style="s2">online and use exactly this terminology</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.020" end="01:31:01.280" style="s2">millions of people listen so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.780" end="01:31:03.230" style="s2">obvious which what percentage of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.280" end="01:31:04.969" style="s2">people see it this way it&#39;s maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.230" end="01:31:06.830" style="s2">they have the intuitions but they</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.969" end="01:31:08.929" style="s2">haven&#39;t been articulated well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.830" end="01:31:13.719" style="s2">this is this is the problem this is what</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.929" end="01:31:18.199" style="s2">worries me about this so yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.719" end="01:31:20.389" style="s2">you could do the same thing with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.199" end="01:31:22.130" style="s2">idea of ghosts right so so people</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.389" end="01:31:24.620" style="s2">traditionally have believed in ghosts</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.130" end="01:31:26.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an archetype you might say</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.620" end="01:31:29.090" style="s2">the ghost survival of death is certainly</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.780" end="01:31:31.159" style="s2">in archetypes and we know what most</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.090" end="01:31:34.520" style="s2">people most of the time mean when they</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.159" end="01:31:36.860" style="s2">say they believe in ghosts and I say I</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.520" end="01:31:39.350" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in ghosts and you say no</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.860" end="01:31:42.620" style="s2">no you you do believe in ghosts ghosts</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.350" end="01:31:46.190" style="s2">are your relationship to the unseen</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.620" end="01:31:47.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a ghost so you have a new</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.190" end="01:31:50.510" style="s2">definition of ghost that you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.840" end="01:31:51.800" style="s2">in the place provided which I have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.510" end="01:31:54.260" style="s2">say well of course I have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.800" end="01:31:55.790" style="s2">to the unseen so yeah I guess I do</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.260" end="01:32:02.360" style="s2">believe in ghosts you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.790" end="01:32:05.300" style="s2">win that argument but that simply isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.360" end="01:32:07.730" style="s2">what most people mean by a ghost mostly</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.300" end="01:32:09.950" style="s2">you mean use that simplified argument</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.730" end="01:32:11.780" style="s2">vote you might consent but ghost as an</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.950" end="01:32:13.490" style="s2">analogy for the proposition that I just</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.780" end="01:32:14.720" style="s2">put forces what I see you do I mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.490" end="01:32:16.880" style="s2">maybe you have more to say on the topic</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.720" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">of God but this is what I hear you doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.880" end="01:32:22.280" style="s2">with God you have defined the God that</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:23.690" style="s2">most people believe in and we know this</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.280" end="01:32:25.880" style="s2">is the God that most people I was asked</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.690" end="01:32:29.690" style="s2">what God I believed in yes no man I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.880" end="01:32:33.050" style="s2">asking you what percentage yes but you</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.690" end="01:32:35.630" style="s2">you by shifting the the definition you</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.050" end="01:32:38.210" style="s2">have robbed the the noun the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.630" end="01:32:40.370" style="s2">noun of its traditional meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.210" end="01:32:43.700" style="s2">you&#39;re giving you&#39;re imparting to people</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.370" end="01:32:45.950" style="s2">yes wait a second wait a second I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.700" end="01:32:48.380" style="s2">so she mean by traditional meaning look</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.950" end="01:32:50.300" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the one of the elemental</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.380" end="01:32:51.620" style="s2">claims in the old testament is that</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.300" end="01:32:53.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not even supposed to utter the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.620" end="01:32:55.820" style="s2">name of God because by defining it too</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.960" end="01:32:57.680" style="s2">tightly you lose its essence and so</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.820" end="01:33:00.020" style="s2">let&#39;s not be talking about what the</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.680" end="01:33:01.910" style="s2">classical definition of God is here okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.020" end="01:33:04.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a historical non-starter okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.910" end="01:33:06.950" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty hold on I can I check in</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.280" end="01:33:10.960" style="s2">with the audience is the audience all</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.950" end="01:33:13.460" style="s2">right with us continuing down this road</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.960" end="01:33:15.530" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.460" end="01:33:18.680" style="s2">tonight can I jump in your sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.530" end="01:33:20.450" style="s2">your Q&amp;A so yeah that it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.680" end="01:33:21.380" style="s2">expense of Q&amp;A that&#39;s that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.450" end="01:33:30.080" style="s2">giving up but I think it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.380" end="01:33:32.930" style="s2">worth it so let me say Sam I do not</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.080" end="01:33:34.340" style="s2">believe in a supernatural God but the</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.930" end="01:33:38.750" style="s2">God that I&#39;ve heard Jordan just</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.340" end="01:33:41.210" style="s2">described I do not have any difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.750" end="01:33:43.070" style="s2">understanding why he might care if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.210" end="01:33:46.490" style="s2">masturbate and I also don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.070" end="01:33:51.770" style="s2">trouble figuring out how he might answer</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.490" end="01:33:54.320" style="s2">prayers well well tell me more then well</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.770" end="01:33:55.850" style="s2">I I can tell you I can tell you I can</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.320" end="01:33:59.750" style="s2">tell you how a prayer might be answered</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.850" end="01:34:02.450" style="s2">okay these are no specifics so so it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.750" end="01:34:04.670" style="s2">be interesting so I&#39;m not Jordan we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.450" end="01:34:07.520" style="s2">not talked about this if I heard an</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.670" end="01:34:09.650" style="s2">answer from him that actually would</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.520" end="01:34:11.540" style="s2">satisfy me as to what the mechanism of</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.650" end="01:34:13.490" style="s2">action might be that that&#39;d be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.540" end="01:34:16.400" style="s2">interesting and if he can tell me what I</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.490" end="01:34:18.260" style="s2">heard I think it would it would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.400" end="01:34:20.600" style="s2">that that we&#39;re not just making up</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.260" end="01:34:23.330" style="s2">stories you can so you might like this</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.600" end="01:34:26.000" style="s2">you may be doing but well it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.330" end="01:34:27.980" style="s2">okay so imagine that okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.000" end="01:34:30.860" style="s2">imagine that hellish situation that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.980" end="01:34:32.450" style="s2">laid out okay but but let&#39;s let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.860" end="01:34:34.280" style="s2">the extra twist in it because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.450" end="01:34:36.200" style="s2">things that we both decided I think was</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.280" end="01:34:38.660" style="s2">that you also have to build in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.200" end="01:34:40.460" style="s2">intent into that so let&#39;s say the hell</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.660" end="01:34:42.430" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.460" end="01:34:45.380" style="s2">victim of the terrible massacres that</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.430" end="01:34:47.960" style="s2">you you laid out in the jungle story but</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.380" end="01:34:50.210" style="s2">a perpetrator okay so someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.960" end="01:34:53.540" style="s2">actually acted in a malevolent manner</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.210" end="01:34:54.890" style="s2">truly malevolent manner okay or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.540" end="01:34:56.450" style="s2">perhaps who wouldn&#39;t have to take that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.890" end="01:34:58.730" style="s2">extreme case we could say well perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.450" end="01:35:00.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve decided that any of you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.730" end="01:35:03.140" style="s2">decided that you&#39;ve seriously done</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.140" end="01:35:04.580" style="s2">something wrong okay and that you you</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.140" end="01:35:05.350" style="s2">want to get away from Hell you want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.580" end="01:35:08.030" style="s2">make things better</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.350" end="01:35:12.020" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s here&#39;s an exercise you</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.030" end="01:35:15.650" style="s2">can try so what you do is is as you sit</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.020" end="01:35:18.980" style="s2">on the edge of your bed and you say okay</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.650" end="01:35:20.390" style="s2">what I did was wrong and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.980" end="01:35:22.340" style="s2">really believe this right so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.390" end="01:35:24.110" style="s2">thought about it&#39;s killing you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.340" end="01:35:26.249" style="s2">killing you it&#39;s now you&#39;re penitent and</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.110" end="01:35:27.989" style="s2">you&#39;re confessing let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.249" end="01:35:31.349" style="s2">and you&#39;re confessing to yourself as</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.989" end="01:35:34.409" style="s2">much as to anyone and you say I really</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.349" end="01:35:35.880" style="s2">want to know what I did wrong and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.409" end="01:35:38.070" style="s2">really want to know what I could do to</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.880" end="01:35:41.190" style="s2">put it right and I&#39;m willing to accept</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.070" end="01:35:44.880" style="s2">any answer that will manifest itself to</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.190" end="01:35:46.530" style="s2">me try that see what happens well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.880" end="01:35:47.880" style="s2">a prayer that will be answered and it</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.530" end="01:35:49.229" style="s2">won&#39;t be answered in the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.880" end="01:35:52.530" style="s2">want it to be answered I can bloody well</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.229" end="01:35:54.090" style="s2">tell you that okay but but that what are</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.530" end="01:35:55.679" style="s2">you communicating with are you</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.090" end="01:35:58.050" style="s2">communicating with will you know that</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.679" end="01:36:01.349" style="s2">that is something that that is a process</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.050" end="01:36:04.460" style="s2">that I&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.349" end="01:36:07.349" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t require any supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.460" end="01:36:10.619" style="s2">explanation and it certainly it</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.349" end="01:36:13.320" style="s2">certainly doesn&#39;t require that many</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.619" end="01:36:14.460" style="s2">imagine that any of our books were</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.320" end="01:36:16.499" style="s2">dictated by the creator of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.460" end="01:36:18.809" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say that it acquired any secret</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.499" end="01:36:21.030" style="s2">nobody nor didn&#39;t require the my concern</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.809" end="01:36:24.300" style="s2">I was asked to provide an instance of</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.030" end="01:36:26.369" style="s2">prayer that worked and that&#39;s what I did</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.300" end="01:36:30.119" style="s2">but neither than that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.369" end="01:36:32.130" style="s2">fully understandable in terms of human</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.119" end="01:36:33.599" style="s2">psychology it&#39;s not understandable</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.130" end="01:36:34.829" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know where the answer</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.599" end="01:36:36.570" style="s2">comes from well we don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.829" end="01:36:40.889" style="s2">anything comes from that&#39;s true yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.570" end="01:36:43.949" style="s2">okay so yeah but that doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.889" end="01:36:46.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t open the door one thing we can</p>

<p begin="01:36:46.710" end="01:36:50.880" style="s2">whoever wrote the Bible didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.659" end="01:36:53.219" style="s2">either and there&#39;s many other things he</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.880" end="01:36:55.559" style="s2">or she didn&#39;t know like everything else</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.219" end="01:36:57.179" style="s2">we know scientifically right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.559" end="01:36:58.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not so obvious whether people know</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.179" end="01:37:01.139" style="s2">when they don&#39;t no one even knew the</p>

<p begin="01:37:01.139" end="01:37:05.820" style="s2">so yeah but as much as we do about how</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.869" end="01:37:07.590" style="s2">the brain was involved in it but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.820" end="01:37:10.320" style="s2">already we&#39;ve already established in</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.590" end="01:37:12.329" style="s2">some tenuous way that things that nobody</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.320" end="01:37:13.920" style="s2">understands could have evolved into</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.329" end="01:37:16.229" style="s2">these stories in some way that would be</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.920" end="01:37:17.789" style="s2">useful but nobody knew what they were</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.229" end="01:37:20.340" style="s2">writing when they wrote it right but the</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.789" end="01:37:22.019" style="s2">problem is that you can so again with</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.340" end="01:37:25.380" style="s2">this has been focused through the lens</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.019" end="01:37:26.070" style="s2">of your attachment to Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.380" end="01:37:29.039" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.070" end="01:37:30.960" style="s2">but the Hinduism Hinduism is a</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.039" end="01:37:34.739" style="s2">completely different set of stories</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.960" end="01:37:37.409" style="s2">right now and many of them the logic the</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.739" end="01:37:38.960" style="s2">emotional logic the psychological import</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.409" end="01:37:42.440" style="s2">many of them have the</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.960" end="01:37:44.840" style="s2">opposite valence from any Christian</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.440" end="01:37:45.980" style="s2">story you would tell the like for</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.840" end="01:37:48.560" style="s2">instance the whole notion of good and</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.980" end="01:37:50.360" style="s2">evil yeah right which has such primacy I</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.560" end="01:37:52.880" style="s2">mean you talk about religion being</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.360" end="01:37:54.739" style="s2">deeper than ethics because ethics just</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.880" end="01:37:56.510" style="s2">deals with right and wrong and religion</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.739" end="01:38:00.110" style="s2">deals with good and evil right at</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.510" end="01:38:04.310" style="s2">bedrock okay good and evil do not have</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.110" end="01:38:06.230" style="s2">the same meaning in the East Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.310" end="01:38:07.880" style="s2">and Hinduism do something very different</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.230" end="01:38:10.820" style="s2">with living I&#39;m willing to accept your</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.880" end="01:38:14.480" style="s2">definitions of good and evil for truth</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.820" end="01:38:17.150" style="s2">is just not even evil is just ignorance</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.480" end="01:38:19.010" style="s2">on some level it&#39;s just evil is just you</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.150" end="01:38:20.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t met any real evil people if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.010" end="01:38:22.219" style="s2">believe that well okay so then all the</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.900" end="01:38:24.590" style="s2">Hindus and Buddhists are wrong about</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.219" end="01:38:26.510" style="s2">this that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a possible</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.590" end="01:38:28.730" style="s2">claim I&#39;m just saying that there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.510" end="01:38:32.270" style="s2">over a billion people who have a</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.730" end="01:38:34.790" style="s2">religious system of stories from which</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.270" end="01:38:36.950" style="s2">they derive all kinds of meaning yep to</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.790" end="01:38:40.060" style="s2">which they&#39;re mightily attached to where</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.950" end="01:38:43.460" style="s2">we could play the same game of</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.060" end="01:38:48.590" style="s2">archetypal interpretation and valuing</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.460" end="01:38:50.300" style="s2">and yet you that the the cash value with</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.590" end="01:38:52.280" style="s2">respect to good and evil is is</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.300" end="01:38:53.989" style="s2">irreconcilable with what you get</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.280" end="01:38:56.030" style="s2">Christianity look well but it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.989" end="01:39:01.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be interoperable right</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.030" end="01:39:04.310" style="s2">well but but in a reality presumably</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.090" end="01:39:07.570" style="s2">Hinduism is also useful that&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.310" end="01:39:10.820" style="s2">heuristic as to be for Hindus and if</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.570" end="01:39:13.100" style="s2">Hinduism as a matter of doctrine and as</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.820" end="01:39:16.580" style="s2">a matter of the interpretations of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.100" end="01:39:19.210" style="s2">heuristics by the devout in both systems</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.580" end="01:39:24.050" style="s2">if Hinduism and Christianity are</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.210" end="01:39:26.719" style="s2">irreconcilable right then there must be</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.050" end="01:39:29.000" style="s2">a deeper level of reality that explains</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.719" end="01:39:31.880" style="s2">why they both work that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.000" end="01:39:35.960" style="s2">reducible to Christianity being true or</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.880" end="01:39:38.560" style="s2">Hinduism being true yeah that&#39;s a look</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.960" end="01:39:41.430" style="s2">Sam that&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.560" end="01:39:44.860" style="s2">nothing wrong with that objection like</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.430" end="01:39:47.860" style="s2">so this is one of the immense problems</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.860" end="01:39:49.690" style="s2">obviously that that actually leads down</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.860" end="01:39:53.110" style="s2">the road to the kind of nihilism that</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.690" end="01:39:55.090" style="s2">you were objecting to in in in the moral</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.110" end="01:39:57.400" style="s2">landscape it&#39;s like one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.090" end="01:39:59.500" style="s2">that Nietzsche said was it was it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.400" end="01:40:02.110" style="s2">much apropos to this is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.500" end="01:40:05.410" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to have your your belief</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.110" end="01:40:06.820" style="s2">system shattered by the observation that</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.410" end="01:40:08.560" style="s2">there are other belief systems that are</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.820" end="01:40:11.380" style="s2">in commencer that seem to have equal</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.560" end="01:40:12.760" style="s2">utility so that that&#39;s but it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.380" end="01:40:14.290" style="s2">worse is that once you make the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.760" end="01:40:16.720" style="s2">observation that there are other belief</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.290" end="01:40:18.460" style="s2">systems that that have equal utility</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.720" end="01:40:20.740" style="s2">then it can shatter your belief in</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.460" end="01:40:22.330" style="s2">belief systems themselves and then</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.740" end="01:40:24.340" style="s2">you&#39;re in the postmodern nihilist</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.330" end="01:40:26.290" style="s2">landscape and that&#39;s a big problem or</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.340" end="01:40:28.420" style="s2">you could just be in a more fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.290" end="01:40:30.400" style="s2">landscape that subsumes both of those</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.420" end="01:40:32.320" style="s2">losses that&#39;s fine let&#39;s hope that that</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:33.970" style="s2">can happen but that I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.320" end="01:40:36.760" style="s2">the landscape that I&#39;m trying to pursue</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.970" end="01:40:38.290" style="s2">now you said that this is that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.760" end="01:40:40.510" style="s2">approaching this safe from from a</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.290" end="01:40:42.280" style="s2">Christian perspective in this dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.510" end="01:40:43.540" style="s2">and to some degree that&#39;s true but there</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.280" end="01:40:46.570" style="s2">are reasons for that but I would also</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.540" end="01:40:49.270" style="s2">say I&#39;m also doing what you recommend</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.570" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">doing because in maps of meaning for</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.270" end="01:40:52.390" style="s2">example because you said well what about</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.040" end="01:40:55.240" style="s2">this problem of multiple interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.390" end="01:40:56.860" style="s2">of you can road maps of meaning what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.240" end="01:40:58.630" style="s2">that you wrote maps of meaning I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.860" end="01:41:06.340" style="s2">them all and sorry I must have missed</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.630" end="01:41:08.920" style="s2">sorry I must have missed but what I</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.340" end="01:41:10.780" style="s2">tried to do well I tried to address that</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.920" end="01:41:12.670" style="s2">problem seriously like it&#39;s a really big</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.780" end="01:41:13.870" style="s2">problem that it&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.670" end="01:41:16.450" style="s2">multiple interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.870" end="01:41:17.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the postmodern problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.450" end="01:41:20.470" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite number of potential</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.710" end="01:41:21.100" style="s2">interpretations okay so also what do we</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.470" end="01:41:22.900" style="s2">do about that</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.100" end="01:41:25.000" style="s2">and the answer is it&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.900" end="01:41:27.820" style="s2">allude to I&#39;m sorry in in the moral</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.000" end="01:41:29.410" style="s2">landscape and and it&#39;s part of the basis</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.820" end="01:41:32.230" style="s2">of your argument why these things need</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.410" end="01:41:34.120" style="s2">to be grounded in facts so because that</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.230" end="01:41:35.410" style="s2">is part of the the answer to the problem</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.120" end="01:41:38.230" style="s2">of an infinite number of interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.410" end="01:41:39.820" style="s2">in maps of meaning I tried to do what al</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.230" end="01:41:41.710" style="s2">Wilson recommended but this was before</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.820" end="01:41:46.120" style="s2">he wrote his book I tried to use a</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.710" end="01:41:47.770" style="s2">conciliation evil is systems I looked at</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.120" end="01:41:49.960" style="s2">Christianity I looked at evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.770" end="01:41:51.030" style="s2">biology I looked at philosophy I looked</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.960" end="01:41:53.070" style="s2">at neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.030" end="01:41:54.990" style="s2">and I looked at the literature on</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.070" end="01:41:57.030" style="s2">emotion and motivation and and in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.990" end="01:41:59.700" style="s2">literature on play that was very nicely</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.030" end="01:42:02.280" style="s2">delineated by Piaget and I tried to see</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.700" end="01:42:04.650" style="s2">where there was a pattern that repeated</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.280" end="01:42:06.180" style="s2">across all dimensions of evaluation</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.650" end="01:42:08.460" style="s2">which is exactly what you do for example</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.180" end="01:42:10.320" style="s2">when you use your five senses to detect</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.460" end="01:42:13.520" style="s2">something real in the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.320" end="01:42:16.440" style="s2">what Wilson recommended was a</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.520" end="01:42:20.090" style="s2">conciliation was if it manifests itself</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.440" end="01:42:22.620" style="s2">here and here and here and here and here</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.090" end="01:42:24.690" style="s2">six places and it&#39;s always the same</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.620" end="01:42:26.960" style="s2">pattern than the probability that that</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.690" end="01:42:29.850" style="s2">pattern exists independent of my</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.960" end="01:42:32.820" style="s2">delusional interpretation is radically</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.850" end="01:42:35.220" style="s2">decreased yeah my claim however is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.820" end="01:42:36.960" style="s2">many of these things don&#39;t repeat in</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.220" end="01:42:39.240" style="s2">fact they&#39;re they&#39;re flipped around</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.960" end="01:42:40.710" style="s2">completely based on different religious</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.240" end="01:42:42.330" style="s2">assumptions and different cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.710" end="01:42:46.050" style="s2">again I mean yeah I would just argue</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.330" end="01:42:47.580" style="s2">this is trying to dispense with those</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.050" end="01:42:50.040" style="s2">but I&#39;m just saying something something</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.580" end="01:42:51.810" style="s2">as fundamental as evil doesn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.040" end="01:42:53.430" style="s2">through all these cultures and all these</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.810" end="01:42:55.350" style="s2">religious traditions then how can you</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.430" end="01:42:56.490" style="s2">make the claim that everyone would agree</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.350" end="01:42:58.560" style="s2">with your description of what</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.490" end="01:43:01.140" style="s2">constitutes bad when we begin again</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.560" end="01:43:03.510" style="s2">landscape it would be it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.140" end="01:43:07.320" style="s2">just not it&#39;s not evil in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.510" end="01:43:09.060" style="s2">that it&#39;s there&#39;s better and worse</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.320" end="01:43:11.130" style="s2">there&#39;s better than words okay so can we</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.060" end="01:43:13.350" style="s2">can we have there&#39;s either universal</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.130" end="01:43:15.930" style="s2">moral intuitions or there are no is it</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.350" end="01:43:20.390" style="s2">yes no but you are some moral intuitions</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.930" end="01:43:23.940" style="s2">Universal yes no I would think that</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.390" end="01:43:25.710" style="s2">listen we are just human beings right</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.940" end="01:43:27.480" style="s2">we&#39;re human beings first before we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.710" end="01:43:29.460" style="s2">Hindu or Buddhist or Christian we can</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.480" end="01:43:31.740" style="s2">all get indoctrinated into the religion</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.460" end="01:43:33.390" style="s2">of our parents this is a an artifice</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.740" end="01:43:35.640" style="s2">that&#39;s laid on top of something far</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.390" end="01:43:38.220" style="s2">deeper that should be obvious so right</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.640" end="01:43:40.170" style="s2">so so I&#39;m trying to get down to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.220" end="01:43:43.080" style="s2">deeper okay so there may be so there may</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.170" end="01:43:45.840" style="s2">be some moral universals sure I think</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.080" end="01:43:49.260" style="s2">okay Jordan no but possible that there</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.840" end="01:43:51.750" style="s2">are some moral intuitions that are</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.260" end="01:43:53.700" style="s2">highly specific to particular traditions</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.750" end="01:43:55.830" style="s2">and wouldn&#39;t translate over to others</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.700" end="01:43:57.480" style="s2">yes oh it&#39;s a highly probable because</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.830" end="01:43:58.980" style="s2">there would be environment specific</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.480" end="01:44:01.680" style="s2">adaptations like the environment</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.980" end="01:44:03.930" style="s2">specific tool use of chimpanzees right</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.680" end="01:44:04.280" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s not even the environment</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.930" end="01:44:06.380" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.280" end="01:44:08.719" style="s2">the self-consistency of the belief</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.380" end="01:44:10.190" style="s2">pattern in question so I&#39;m sure I would</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.719" end="01:44:11.869" style="s2">put that in the broader environment it</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.190" end="01:44:13.159" style="s2">might be a consequence of the particular</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.869" end="01:44:14.539" style="s2">ease of that culture there would be</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.159" end="01:44:17.300" style="s2">things that look think about it like</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.539" end="01:44:18.949" style="s2">languages like many and that this is</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.300" end="01:44:20.510" style="s2">kind of an answer to the problem that</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.949" end="01:44:22.429" style="s2">you you laid out which is a real problem</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.510" end="01:44:24.559" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to deny the problem if</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.429" end="01:44:26.630" style="s2">you look at there&#39;s a lot of languages</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.559" end="01:44:28.400" style="s2">lots of languages look at how different</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.630" end="01:44:29.750" style="s2">they are it&#39;s like yeah at some levels</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.400" end="01:44:30.949" style="s2">of analysis they&#39;re fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.750" end="01:44:32.480" style="s2">different and at other levels of</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.949" end="01:44:33.440" style="s2">analysis they&#39;re fundamentally the same</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.480" end="01:44:35.270" style="s2">which is how we know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.440" end="01:44:37.309" style="s2">languages and you could say well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.270" end="01:44:41.059" style="s2">a very large number of stories it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.309" end="01:44:42.980" style="s2">yes there are but the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.059" end="01:44:44.719" style="s2">enough commonality across the class of</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.980" end="01:44:46.309" style="s2">stories the set of all possible stories</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.719" end="01:44:48.079" style="s2">so that we can identify what constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.309" end="01:44:49.940" style="s2">a story and I would say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.079" end="01:44:51.770" style="s2">enough commonality across the set of all</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.940" end="01:44:53.480" style="s2">possible good stories that we can say</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.770" end="01:44:54.800" style="s2">well here&#39;s a canonical good story which</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.480" end="01:44:56.539" style="s2">is by the way what you do at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.800" end="01:44:59.570" style="s2">beginning of the moral landscape because</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.539" end="01:45:01.429" style="s2">you say this is horrible this is good</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.570" end="01:45:04.099" style="s2">we should move from what&#39;s horrible to</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.429" end="01:45:06.440" style="s2">what&#39;s good say yes you&#39;re you&#39;ve you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.099" end="01:45:08.300" style="s2">taken a fragment of the universal story</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.440" end="01:45:10.520" style="s2">and you&#39;ve made it the axiom of your</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.300" end="01:45:13.789" style="s2">moral system which is what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.520" end="01:45:17.270" style="s2">it&#39;s but but the claim that that I think</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.789" end="01:45:21.380" style="s2">is not helpful even though I understand</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.270" end="01:45:25.400" style="s2">it is that that&#39;s purely a claim of like</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.380" end="01:45:28.820" style="s2">of unmediated fact it&#39;s like no there is</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.400" end="01:45:31.219" style="s2">no unpeople there is yes even facts</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.820" end="01:45:33.020" style="s2">aren&#39;t unmediated facts I mean you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.219" end="01:45:35.210" style="s2">right hand you can&#39;t judge something to</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.020" end="01:45:36.800" style="s2">be factual without presupposing the</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.210" end="01:45:39.590" style="s2">validity of certain intuitions like</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.800" end="01:45:41.840" style="s2">right that that causes precede events</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.590" end="01:45:45.320" style="s2">you know so our causes precede their</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.840" end="01:45:46.550" style="s2">effects and those intuitions could be</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.320" end="01:45:47.929" style="s2">wrong I mean we could live in a</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.550" end="01:45:49.730" style="s2">teleological universe where everything</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.929" end="01:45:52.070" style="s2">is getting pulled into the future by</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.730" end="01:45:53.780" style="s2">some kind of a tractor right and our</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.070" end="01:45:57.260" style="s2">notion of causation is totally backwards</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.780" end="01:45:59.809" style="s2">that remains to be discovered and we</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.260" end="01:46:03.349" style="s2">have we would use other intuitions to</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.809" end="01:46:04.909" style="s2">make that discovery so is it again you</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.349" end="01:46:08.329" style="s2">do pull yourself up by your bootstraps</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.909" end="01:46:10.849" style="s2">and that there&#39;s there&#39;s no branch of</p>

<p begin="01:46:10.849" end="01:46:15.409" style="s2">fundamental logic that can get away from</p>

<p begin="01:46:15.409" end="01:46:17.680" style="s2">place but given that</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.450" end="01:46:21.490" style="s2">picture that doesn&#39;t render all</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.680" end="01:46:23.770" style="s2">intuitions equally respectable</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.490" end="01:46:25.530" style="s2">absolutely someone says well I happen to</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.770" end="01:46:28.770" style="s2">have an intuition that that Joseph Smith</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.530" end="01:46:31.930" style="s2">saw those golden tablets and they were</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.770" end="01:46:33.430" style="s2">you know in Mormonism is true that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.930" end="01:46:33.940" style="s2">the sort of intuition we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.430" end="01:46:35.470" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.940" end="01:46:39.540" style="s2">your intuition doesn&#39;t look well rigged</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.470" end="01:46:44.440" style="s2">insight into history we could say a</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.540" end="01:46:45.790" style="s2">Brett&#39;s point is that like moral</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.440" end="01:46:47.950" style="s2">intuitions of the sort that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.790" end="01:46:50.320" style="s2">describing have different zones of</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.950" end="01:46:53.890" style="s2">relevance so there&#39;s some things that</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.320" end="01:46:56.560" style="s2">would only work as an intuition in very</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.890" end="01:46:58.660" style="s2">delimited areas of time and space let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.560" end="01:47:00.190" style="s2">say there&#39;s a hierarchy of moral</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.660" end="01:47:01.510" style="s2">intuitions and the more profound the</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.190" end="01:47:03.430" style="s2">intuition the more it works as a</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.510" end="01:47:06.130" style="s2">universal truth across contexts just</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.430" end="01:47:08.200" style="s2">like in a scientific truth so the</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.130" end="01:47:10.360" style="s2">scientific truth is more profound this</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.200" end="01:47:12.820" style="s2">is why the postmodernist readings of</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.360" end="01:47:15.010" style="s2">Thomas Kuhn are wrong is that the idea</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.820" end="01:47:17.200" style="s2">that protons are real is really</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.010" end="01:47:19.840" style="s2">fundamental because no matter what span</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.200" end="01:47:22.060" style="s2">of time and space that you pick you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.840" end="01:47:24.190" style="s2">going to encounter protons it works</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.060" end="01:47:25.990" style="s2">everywhere and then with moral</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.190" end="01:47:27.610" style="s2">intuitions let&#39;s say are morally</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.990" end="01:47:29.530" style="s2">priorities you have the same issue as</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.610" end="01:47:31.960" style="s2">some of them are so delimited that they</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.530" end="01:47:34.570" style="s2">only work here and now and those are</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.960" end="01:47:36.580" style="s2">sort of impulsive low-level intuitions a</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.570" end="01:47:38.830" style="s2">whim even but some of them are really</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.580" end="01:47:41.020" style="s2">really deep the ones for example the one</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.830" end="01:47:44.170" style="s2">that Orient&#39;s you to make the claim that</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.020" end="01:47:46.330" style="s2">you made in the moral landscape that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.170" end="01:47:48.130" style="s2">hellish story is bad and the heavenly</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.330" end="01:47:50.680" style="s2">story is good right I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.130" end="01:47:52.960" style="s2">one of the deepest most context</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.680" end="01:47:54.640" style="s2">independent moral intuitions which which</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.960" end="01:47:56.320" style="s2">is kind of the claim you make except you</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.640" end="01:47:57.970" style="s2">claimed it and again back to my</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.320" end="01:47:59.050" style="s2">fundamental concern here and in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.970" end="01:48:00.190" style="s2">difference with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.050" end="01:48:04.740" style="s2">difference in with how we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.190" end="01:48:07.990" style="s2">these things to call that thing God is</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.740" end="01:48:10.720" style="s2">fine that&#39;s a god I have no problem with</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.990" end="01:48:12.580" style="s2">right but that&#39;s not how most people</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.720" end="01:48:14.380" style="s2">most of the time are using the word and</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.580" end="01:48:16.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something misleading about that</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.380" end="01:48:18.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s that worries me yeah well if</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.900" end="01:48:21.530" style="s2">if the claim</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.800" end="01:48:23.750" style="s2">if the claim that you&#39;re making is that</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.530" end="01:48:25.730" style="s2">we&#39;re all deeply confused about the</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.750" end="01:48:30.200" style="s2">nature of divinity and ultimate reality</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.730" end="01:48:31.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yes another thing we</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.200" end="01:48:34.730" style="s2">agree on I also don&#39;t disagree</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.820" end="01:48:37.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t disagree look I&#39;ve never said</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.730" end="01:48:41.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve never made the claim that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.970" end="01:48:43.580" style="s2">talking about is like what other people</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.600" end="01:48:45.920" style="s2">are talking about I mean it is in some</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.580" end="01:48:47.390" style="s2">ways but I&#39;ve not made that claim so I</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.920" end="01:48:50.510" style="s2">don&#39;t see why that&#39;s a justifiable</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.390" end="01:48:53.930" style="s2">criticism it&#39;s like well no it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.510" end="01:48:57.080" style="s2">a criticism in the with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.930" end="01:48:59.240" style="s2">very likely effects of communicating in</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.080" end="01:49:00.560" style="s2">that way because I see the results of</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.240" end="01:49:02.060" style="s2">that communication it&#39;s a little bit I</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.560" end="01:49:03.320" style="s2">mean this is gonna sound more invidious</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.060" end="01:49:04.940" style="s2">than it is but they have the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.320" end="01:49:08.150" style="s2">thing that I get into a Deepak Chopra</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.940" end="01:49:10.040" style="s2">yeah Deepak and I agree about a lot I</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.150" end="01:49:13.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s more invidious than it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.040" end="01:49:15.110" style="s2">actually yeah well you&#39;re not wearing</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.250" end="01:49:17.270" style="s2">rhinestone book glasses with you if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.110" end="01:49:24.250" style="s2">graduate to that we&#39;ll have more of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.270" end="01:49:28.160" style="s2">problem but it&#39;s Deepak clearly wants to</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.250" end="01:49:30.580" style="s2">let his audience believe that everything</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.160" end="01:49:34.370" style="s2">they&#39;re into is on some level</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.580" end="01:49:37.310" style="s2">justifiable by his reading of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.370" end="01:49:39.470" style="s2">spookiness right so it&#39;s all so you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.310" end="01:49:41.750" style="s2">if you want to go out and just buy a lot</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.470" end="01:49:45.890" style="s2">of crystals and think they&#39;re gonna heal</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.750" end="01:49:48.380" style="s2">you it has something to do with really</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.890" end="01:49:51.620" style="s2">nothing like you know know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.380" end="01:49:53.780" style="s2">saying but I think Deepak could say if I</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.620" end="01:49:57.320" style="s2">if I got his back to the wall yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.780" end="01:49:59.540" style="s2">Deepak could say honestly say listen</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.320" end="01:50:01.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve never said anything about crystals</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.540" end="01:50:04.160" style="s2">right I&#39;m not selling crystals I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.520" end="01:50:06.710" style="s2">never said they work but it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.160" end="01:50:08.690" style="s2">way in which he&#39;s failing to make the</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.710" end="01:50:11.360" style="s2">clear differentiation defendant that the</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.690" end="01:50:15.140" style="s2">fact that it takes you 20 minutes to</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.360" end="01:50:18.140" style="s2">admit that there&#39;s that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.140" end="01:50:19.910" style="s2">Bible is filled with barbaric nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.140" end="01:50:24.980" style="s2">they&#39;re like it took me 20 minutes to</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.910" end="01:50:28.960" style="s2">admit these things matter these things</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.980" end="01:50:31.670" style="s2">matter and I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.960" end="01:50:35.840" style="s2">say that you injure if you&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="01:50:40.040" end="01:50:45.110" style="s2">with the with the bible thumpers in my</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.410" end="01:50:47.600" style="s2">country who think that Jesus is very</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.110" end="01:50:49.610" style="s2">likely coming back in their lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.600" end="01:50:51.350" style="s2">because he never died and he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.610" end="01:50:54.740" style="s2">judge the living and the dead and there</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.350" end="01:50:56.300" style="s2">will be a resurrection and Hellfire and</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.740" end="01:51:05.600" style="s2">all the rest if that&#39;s not the game</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.300" end="01:51:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;re playing at all on it why why are</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.600" end="01:51:10.190" style="s2">you why are you why are you all</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.820" end="01:51:11.900" style="s2">applauding about that it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.190" end="01:51:14.030" style="s2">what do you mean own it it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.900" end="01:51:15.740" style="s2">already made my claim it&#39;s like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.030" end="01:51:18.080" style="s2">playing a religious fundamentalist game</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.740" end="01:51:21.470" style="s2">so what&#39;s all the applause about so I</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.080" end="01:51:25.130" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that and own it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.470" end="01:51:27.830" style="s2">like I was just listen I was as clear as</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.130" end="01:51:30.170" style="s2">I possibly could be when I delineate it</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.830" end="01:51:33.560" style="s2">my answer to the question people say</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.170" end="01:51:36.710" style="s2">well what do you mean by God asked you</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.560" end="01:51:37.850" style="s2">if Jesus was one second answer but no</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.710" end="01:51:40.430" style="s2">well forget it</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.850" end="01:51:43.910" style="s2">Jordan Jordan Jordan women well I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.430" end="01:51:45.890" style="s2">we can actually this is one second I</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.910" end="01:51:48.470" style="s2">don&#39;t want to end on it I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.890" end="01:51:50.030" style="s2">end on a note of acrimony but someone</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.470" end="01:51:52.820" style="s2">once asked you whether you thought Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.030" end="01:51:54.800" style="s2">was literally resurrected and you said</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.820" end="01:51:57.920" style="s2">it would take me 40 hours to answer that</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.800" end="01:51:59.270" style="s2">question okay that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.920" end="01:52:01.220" style="s2">kind of thing I&#39;m responding to here you</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.270" end="01:52:03.590" style="s2">don&#39;t need to do that if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.220" end="01:52:05.450" style="s2">clear-cut answer to that question I</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.590" end="01:52:08.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have it clear down to a few bones</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.450" end="01:52:10.370" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t that that connects with</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.660" end="01:52:11.030" style="s2">many other things that we still have to</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.370" end="01:52:13.930" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.030" end="01:52:16.640" style="s2">yes definitely yeah because because that</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.930" end="01:52:20.030" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious in the biblical account</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.640" end="01:52:22.760" style="s2">that Christ was literally resurrected so</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.030" end="01:52:25.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not simple no no no no it don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.760" end="01:52:27.080" style="s2">if the question is do you think he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.340" end="01:52:28.580" style="s2">let us put it probabilistically I mean</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.080" end="01:52:30.140" style="s2">anything&#39;s possible I&#39;ll tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.580" end="01:52:31.790" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that he was physically</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.140" end="01:52:34.100" style="s2">resurrected I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.790" end="01:52:36.860" style="s2">even wait a second ID with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.100" end="01:52:38.600" style="s2">quantum mechanics the point is yes it</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.860" end="01:52:40.310" style="s2">would take me 40 hours to answer the</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.600" end="01:52:41.960" style="s2">question I didn&#39;t say that he was we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.310" end="01:52:50.090" style="s2">go ahead way how&#39;s this for an answer</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.960" end="01:52:54.710" style="s2">almost certainly not what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.090" end="01:52:56.960" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with that answer you want I</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.710" end="01:53:02.660" style="s2">think I think I know what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.960" end="01:53:04.280" style="s2">that answer it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.660" end="01:53:05.900" style="s2">answer and people have been giving that</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.280" end="01:53:07.840" style="s2">answer for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.900" end="01:53:10.520" style="s2">but the idea doesn&#39;t seem to go away</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.840" end="01:53:13.850" style="s2">okay and there&#39;s evidence of what</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.520" end="01:53:16.430" style="s2">exactly I don&#39;t know okay I can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.850" end="01:53:19.100" style="s2">one thing it&#39;s an evidence of all right</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.430" end="01:53:20.870" style="s2">a deep idea let this be the doorway to</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.100" end="01:53:23.330" style="s2">our next three-hour conversation sure</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.870" end="01:53:24.410" style="s2">they clearly weren&#39;t sure so we have we</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.330" end="01:53:26.540" style="s2">have ten minutes left</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.410" end="01:53:27.530" style="s2">okay well then let&#39;s answer that</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.540" end="01:53:30.470" style="s2">question in ten minutes</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.530" end="01:53:32.570" style="s2">so wait I want you to trust me here you</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.470" end="01:53:34.310" style="s2">for whatever reason decided I should</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.570" end="01:53:37.340" style="s2">moderate so I want you to trust me</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.310" end="01:53:38.570" style="s2">one thing you finish the Omens worse I</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.340" end="01:53:41.090" style="s2">really would like to answer that</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.570" end="01:53:43.310" style="s2">question like but I&#39;m trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.090" end="01:53:45.020" style="s2">out if people seem to think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.310" end="01:53:46.910" style="s2">trying to evade the question it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.020" end="01:53:48.860" style="s2">not evading the question I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.910" end="01:53:51.380" style="s2">figure it out it&#39;s a really people have</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.860" end="01:53:54.290" style="s2">been arguing about this for 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.380" end="01:53:56.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s not simple that&#39;s a simp</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.290" end="01:53:59.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a symptom of the effect of</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.750" end="01:54:02.600" style="s2">religious dogma tis &#39;m for 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.540" end="01:54:04.520" style="s2">no it&#39;s not okay it&#39;s hardly a symptom</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.600" end="01:54:07.480" style="s2">of that it&#39;s also partly a symptom of</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.520" end="01:54:09.740" style="s2">the idea the resurrection of Jesus is</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.480" end="01:54:12.080" style="s2">clearly an important question but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.740" end="01:54:13.580" style="s2">raised a much bigger and more pressing</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.080" end="01:54:15.440" style="s2">question for the audience which is</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.580" end="01:54:19.310" style="s2">whether or not God cares whether they</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.440" end="01:54:22.130" style="s2">masturbate so I actually think if we</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.310" end="01:54:24.920" style="s2">pursue that answer that we will actually</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.130" end="01:54:27.820" style="s2">wrap this up in a way that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.920" end="01:54:27.820" style="s2">end this on masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.900" end="01:54:37.920" style="s2">I think we owe it to them or - okay so</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.860" end="01:54:42.960" style="s2">well hey give me a little leisure that</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.920" end="01:54:45.870" style="s2">the floor is yours how did I end up here</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.960" end="01:54:47.510" style="s2">alright so here&#39;s here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.870" end="01:54:51.480" style="s2">let&#39;s just figure out if we can</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.510" end="01:54:54.210" style="s2">determine why God might care if you</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.480" end="01:54:56.490" style="s2">masturbate right so let&#39;s suppose that</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.210" end="01:54:59.310" style="s2">we have a story a heuristic of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.490" end="01:55:02.970" style="s2">that stands in for something and the</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.310" end="01:55:05.580" style="s2">story is God is watching he sees you</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.970" end="01:55:12.480" style="s2">always he doesn&#39;t want you masturbating</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.580" end="01:55:14.100" style="s2">so don&#39;t you dare what happens what</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.480" end="01:55:19.500" style="s2">happens yeah</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.100" end="01:55:22.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s rather ineffectual news</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.500" end="01:55:25.050" style="s2">idea yeah well I mean if you think that</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.440" end="01:55:27.000" style="s2">story I think some people from well no</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.050" end="01:55:28.950" style="s2">but I think the reality was was that you</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.000" end="01:55:30.480" style="s2">had people masturbating and feeling</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.950" end="01:55:33.000" style="s2">terrible about it and you had a whole</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.480" end="01:55:34.820" style="s2">layer of sexual neurosis that we got</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.000" end="01:55:37.020" style="s2">grafted on to human psychology</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.820" end="01:55:40.320" style="s2">unnecessarily okay so she Anna T has a</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.020" end="01:55:42.360" style="s2">certain technology of sexual hang-up</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.320" end="01:55:44.160" style="s2">array which which you know that the</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.360" end="01:55:45.660" style="s2">tantra --cz don&#39;t have so if i</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.160" end="01:55:48.240" style="s2">understand you correctly you are</p>

<p begin="02:02:02.230" end="02:02:06.130" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing special about pork</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.610" end="02:02:08.830" style="s2">necessarily or whatever the example is</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.130" end="02:02:11.050" style="s2">and once you get the actual variables in</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.830" end="02:02:12.670" style="s2">hand then the whole edifice comes</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.050" end="02:02:13.960" style="s2">crashing down and then you really just</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.670" end="02:02:16.090" style="s2">want to understand the variables that</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.960" end="02:02:17.890" style="s2">work look I don&#39;t know if I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.090" end="02:02:19.810" style="s2">if the whole edifice comes crashing down</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.890" end="02:02:21.790" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t clear to me that you want</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.810" end="02:02:23.590" style="s2">to claim that because one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.790" end="02:02:25.120" style="s2">you did say in the moral landscape and I</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.590" end="02:02:27.250" style="s2">think this is associated with your</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.120" end="02:02:29.110" style="s2">interest in spirituality is that there</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.250" end="02:02:32.110" style="s2">is some baby mixed in with the bathwater</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.110" end="02:02:34.360" style="s2">and the question is how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.110" end="02:02:36.400" style="s2">how do we distill that out yeah and the</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.360" end="02:02:38.860" style="s2">objections that you&#39;re raising are the</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.400" end="02:02:40.660" style="s2">objections that are look how difficult</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.860" end="02:02:42.550" style="s2">it is to do the distillation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.660" end="02:02:44.800" style="s2">yeah absolutely man and it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.550" end="02:02:46.690" style="s2">I&#39;m a foal of the Enlightenment I think</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.800" end="02:02:48.850" style="s2">you enlightenment types and I put Pinker</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.690" end="02:02:50.770" style="s2">in the same cab a radically overestimate</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.850" end="02:02:52.990" style="s2">the degree to that was that was a cause</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.770" end="02:02:55.660" style="s2">of sui it&#39;s like everyone was barbaric</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.990" end="02:02:57.490" style="s2">and superstitious until 1750 and some</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.660" end="02:02:59.140" style="s2">miracle occurred and now we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.490" end="02:03:00.469" style="s2">what we all became enlightened like</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.140" end="02:03:02.510" style="s2">there was a lengthy develop</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.469" end="02:03:04.849" style="s2">clearly all haven&#39;t them in with this</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.510" end="02:03:06.920" style="s2">hence hence two are complaining about</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.849" end="02:03:08.059" style="s2">the problem and most of the world most</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.920" end="02:03:10.670" style="s2">of the world hasn&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.059" end="02:03:12.650" style="s2">Enlightenment drew on some look no no</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.670" end="02:03:14.690" style="s2">fold the Enlightenment but I think that</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.650" end="02:03:16.460" style="s2">it had a lengthy developmental history</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.690" end="02:03:18.559" style="s2">that is Braddock Lee under played by the</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.460" end="02:03:20.239" style="s2">people who who grounded purely in</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.559" end="02:03:23.329" style="s2">rationality it&#39;s clearly still</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.239" end="02:03:29.179" style="s2">developing my point is we we should be</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.329" end="02:03:33.949" style="s2">able to agree that having a worldview</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.179" end="02:03:35.630" style="s2">guided by a continuous honest engagement</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.949" end="02:03:40.190" style="s2">with reality and so far as we can</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.630" end="02:03:45.249" style="s2">apprehend it is better than having a</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.190" end="02:03:48.349" style="s2">worldview solidified or anchored to</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.249" end="02:03:51.409" style="s2">unchanging ideas that were born of</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.349" end="02:03:53.119" style="s2">people who had none of our present tools</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.409" end="02:03:55.849" style="s2">none of our present insights into</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.119" end="02:03:57.829" style="s2">anything Paul it depends on it depends</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.849" end="02:03:59.539" style="s2">on the principles it depends on the</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.829" end="02:04:01.130" style="s2">principles like I would say there there</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.539" end="02:04:02.809" style="s2">are situations where that clearly</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.130" end="02:04:04.969" style="s2">applies but I think there are broad</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.809" end="02:04:07.280" style="s2">principles and again we should probably</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.969" end="02:04:09.499" style="s2">stop with this I think yep I&#39;m out there</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.280" end="02:04:10.789" style="s2">because I&#39;m I&#39;m starting to get tired</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.499" end="02:04:13.429" style="s2">I&#39;m sure everyone else in here is</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.789" end="02:04:16.579" style="s2">starting to get tired well I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.429" end="02:04:19.729" style="s2">to get tired anyways and I mean the the</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.579" end="02:04:21.260" style="s2">there are there are principles there are</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.729" end="02:04:24.050" style="s2">higher order principles of the sort that</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.260" end="02:04:25.670" style="s2">I described that you also appear to rely</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.050" end="02:04:27.829" style="s2">on in the moral landscape the idea of</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.670" end="02:04:31.309" style="s2">these profound moral intuitions yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.829" end="02:04:33.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I&#39;m after is what are</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.309" end="02:04:35.119" style="s2">these profound moral intuitions and what</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.440" end="02:04:37.760" style="s2">is their source and like I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.119" end="02:04:39.800" style="s2">perfectly willing to make the claim and</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.760" end="02:04:41.599" style="s2">have in fact in in detail that these</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.800" end="02:04:43.159" style="s2">moral intuitions see that this is a</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.599" end="02:04:45.349" style="s2">place where we differ a little bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.159" end="02:04:50.300" style="s2">like and maybe we can go here tomorrow</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.349" end="02:04:52.909" style="s2">night see it seems to me that that you</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.300" end="02:04:54.320" style="s2">for you for you in your argument is the</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.909" end="02:04:56.780" style="s2">facts are laying out there and you can</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.320" end="02:04:58.130" style="s2">extract out value from them and and we</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.780" end="02:05:01.219" style="s2">already described why you want to do</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.130" end="02:05:03.199" style="s2">that because you want to at least not</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.219" end="02:05:04.639" style="s2">move into the nihilistic direction and</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.199" end="02:05:07.789" style="s2">you want to ground them in some sort of</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.639" end="02:05:10.729" style="s2">reality it&#39;s like fair enough but the</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.789" end="02:05:12.619" style="s2">thing is is that the facts as they are</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.729" end="02:05:13.570" style="s2">have been around for a very very very</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.619" end="02:05:15.340" style="s2">very long time</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.570" end="02:05:17.530" style="s2">right let&#39;s say three and a half billion</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.340" end="02:05:19.990" style="s2">years the entire expanse of life and</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.530" end="02:05:22.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the operation of those facts on</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.990" end="02:05:25.510" style="s2">life that has produced the a priori</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.740" end="02:05:27.370" style="s2">implicit interpretive structures that</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.510" end="02:05:29.710" style="s2">guide our interaction with the facts and</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.370" end="02:05:31.330" style="s2">those a priori implicit structures that</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.710" end="02:05:34.390" style="s2">have emerged out of this evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.330" end="02:05:36.430" style="s2">course have a structure that mediates</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.390" end="02:05:40.960" style="s2">between us and the facts that cannot be</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.430" end="02:05:42.220" style="s2">derived from the facts at hand so so</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.960" end="02:05:44.560" style="s2">then the question is what is that</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.220" end="02:05:46.030" style="s2">structure and and it&#39;s in both of our</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.560" end="02:05:48.040" style="s2">interests to get that right yeah because</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.030" end="02:05:50.230" style="s2">you use that as the source of moral</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.040" end="02:05:53.170" style="s2">intuition it&#39;s like right agreed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.230" end="02:05:55.240" style="s2">the source of moral intuition so and and</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.170" end="02:05:56.560" style="s2">Clint clearly what we need to table this</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.240" end="02:05:58.540" style="s2">for tomorrow night but that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.560" end="02:06:01.360" style="s2">yeah guys I&#39;m just going to interrupt</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.540" end="02:06:03.460" style="s2">you guys let&#39;s give Jordan Peterson Sam</p>
