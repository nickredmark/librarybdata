<p begin="00:02:53.780" end="00:03:00.500" style="s2">experience so today I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:03.410" style="s2">that I want to talk about transformative</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.500" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">experience and the pivotal and really</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">brilliant work of La Paul on the notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">of transformative experience but before</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:13.310" style="s2">I do that we have to step back and talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:15.130" style="s2">a little bit about altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.310" end="00:03:17.000" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.130" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">by an altered state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.000" end="00:03:24.590" style="s2">what we mean by this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.010" end="00:03:25.610" style="s2">transformation and that I mean that gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.590" end="00:03:28.340" style="s2">us into one of the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.610" end="00:03:29.799" style="s2">problems David Chalmers famously called</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.340" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">it the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.799" end="00:03:34.310" style="s2">Arthur Schopenhauer called it the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:37.370" style="s2">not trying to explain consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.310" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">like trying to explain God right it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.370" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">one of the hardest problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.780" end="00:03:42.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to endeavor to do all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:46.670" style="s2">that although I&#39;m going to try and make</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.470" end="00:03:48.470" style="s2">use of some of the work that myself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.670" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">Anderson Todd and Richard Wu have put</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.470" end="00:03:55.030" style="s2">into trying to understand at least some</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:58.579" style="s2">of the important functions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.030" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">properties of consciousness and why</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.579" end="00:04:08.060" style="s2">altered states of consciousness can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:12.980" style="s2">so a40 of radical transformative</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.060" end="00:04:15.620" style="s2">experience so one way to do this is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.980" end="00:04:17.269" style="s2">look at two sort of questions we can ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.620" end="00:04:19.329" style="s2">ourselves one is what is consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.269" end="00:04:21.410" style="s2">how does something like consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.329" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">emerges Hort of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.410" end="00:04:26.660" style="s2">consciousness and a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:28.039" style="s2">doing a lot of work on that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.660" end="00:04:29.570" style="s2">can also ask questions about what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.039" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">function of consciousness what does</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:35.570" style="s2">consciousness do those aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:38.420" style="s2">question because you may be surprised to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.570" end="00:04:40.760" style="s2">hear that we don&#39;t have a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.420" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">on what consciousness does most people</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.760" end="00:04:45.470" style="s2">know that consciousness is a mystery but</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:47.650" style="s2">most people don&#39;t realize that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.470" end="00:04:50.480" style="s2">consciousness does is also a mystery I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.650" end="00:04:52.970" style="s2">mean think about it this way you love</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.480" end="00:04:54.350" style="s2">your consciousness and you identify with</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.970" end="00:04:55.910" style="s2">it you don&#39;t just and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.350" end="00:04:58.190" style="s2">your consciousness the way you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.910" end="00:05:00.290" style="s2">other things you know your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.190" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">by being conscious like if I ask you if</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.290" end="00:05:04.070" style="s2">you&#39;re conscious right now you are how</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:05.960" style="s2">did you do that you just are conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.070" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">and you know that you&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.960" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">knowing and being remember Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:17.260" style="s2">conformity and I are the same you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:19.700" style="s2">participate in your consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.260" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">and what would you what would you give</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.700" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">it up but what have I said to you you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:25.100" style="s2">could have unlimited power and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.990" style="s2">all you have to sacrifice is any</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">consciousness of it would you take the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.990" end="00:05:36.140" style="s2">deal of course not but what does it do</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:39.230" style="s2">well you say well well it&#39;s uh no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.140" end="00:05:40.750" style="s2">not obvious because you can do and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.230" end="00:05:45.290" style="s2">do most of your things without</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.750" end="00:05:47.630" style="s2">consciousness I have no understanding no</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.290" end="00:05:49.040" style="s2">conscious awareness I should say at some</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.630" end="00:05:51.470" style="s2">scientific understanding I have no</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.040" end="00:05:53.480" style="s2">conscious awareness of what my brain is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.470" end="00:05:59.210" style="s2">doing that is allowing me to generate</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.480" end="00:06:01.430" style="s2">speech do you you don&#39;t this complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.210" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">sophisticated thing that we still can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.430" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">get artificial intelligence to do well</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:09.350" style="s2">it&#39;s happening almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:12.410" style="s2">unconsciously what&#39;s my consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.350" end="00:06:13.880" style="s2">for what does it - so two really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.410" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">important questions how does something</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.880" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">as mysterious and strange arise out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.430" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">matter that&#39;s the nature question and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:26.270" style="s2">what does it do again I am NOT going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">presume or dare to try and answer these</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.270" end="00:06:30.050" style="s2">comprehensively I don&#39;t need that for</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing here because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.050" end="00:06:33.410" style="s2">trying to solve the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">consciousness I&#39;m trying to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.410" end="00:06:39.350" style="s2">hard problem of meaning one hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">at a time please but what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.350" end="00:06:42.980" style="s2">is show you how a convergence of work</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:44.660" style="s2">that some of the best work that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.980" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">done on consciousness points towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.660" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">something that will tell us why altered</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:50.070" style="s2">states of consciousness can be so</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:52.200" style="s2">valuable to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.070" end="00:06:54.390" style="s2">so what about one of the best accounts</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.200" end="00:07:04.440" style="s2">for the function of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.390" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">called the global workspace theory so</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.440" end="00:07:09.720" style="s2">the idea is that your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:13.290" style="s2">functions very much like that desktop of</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.290" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">have your desktop and then you have all</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.480" end="00:07:22.890" style="s2">your files right and what you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:24.570" style="s2">you can activate a file you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.890" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">that information into the desktop and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:28.320" style="s2">you can activate this file and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:29.940" style="s2">into the desktop and then these pieces</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:32.910" style="s2">of information can interact with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.940" end="00:07:36.930" style="s2">other and then you can broadcast back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.910" end="00:07:38.220" style="s2">any or all or just one file the changes</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.930" end="00:07:41.130" style="s2">you brought about that&#39;s how your</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.220" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">desktop works that&#39;s how you use it well</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">what&#39;s the analogy the analogy is here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:48.780" style="s2">all of your unconscious processing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:50.550" style="s2">your brain and what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.780" end="00:07:53.010" style="s2">retrieve it bring it into a space</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.550" end="00:07:55.200" style="s2">something like working memory you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.010" end="00:07:57.420" style="s2">activate it so that the pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.200" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">information can interact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.420" end="00:08:09.180" style="s2">and then you broadcast it back right to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:13.110" style="s2">any and all of the existing files why do</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.180" end="00:08:13.830" style="s2">you want to do that why do you do it on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.110" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">your computer</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">well you don&#39;t want all of your files</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:22.740" style="s2">active at the same time because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">disaster you want to be able and notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.740" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here you want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:29.150" style="s2">to select certain pieces of information</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">that are relevant bring them together</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.150" end="00:08:34.380" style="s2">transform them in a way that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">and then broadcasts that changes back</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.380" end="00:08:45.030" style="s2">that are needed so the global workspace</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:47.520" style="s2">theory says this is and it&#39;s gaining a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.030" end="00:08:50.280" style="s2">lot of empirical evidence to support it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.520" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">says this is what consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.280" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">functioning to do now this is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:59.130" style="s2">general so more specifically and so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:09:02.370" style="s2">theory is associated with bars and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.130" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">there was a paper by bars shanahan and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.370" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">bars</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.050" end="00:09:11.610" style="s2">that more specifically trying to answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:14.150" style="s2">the question about yeah but what what</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.610" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">why this machinery bars also published</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.150" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">an attempt to answer that question more</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">specifically in the Cambridge handbook</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:25.770" style="s2">of consciousness what it comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">is the idea that what what what this</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.770" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">architecture is helping to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">solve a problem that&#39;s called the frame</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:33.660" style="s2">problem now I&#39;m going to talk much later</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.740" style="s2">in specifically what the frame problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.660" end="00:09:36.630" style="s2">is to put a pin in it we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.740" end="00:09:40.200" style="s2">come back to it but the basic idea here</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.630" end="00:09:43.050" style="s2">is right what this is doing is helping</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.200" end="00:09:46.230" style="s2">you to zero in on relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.050" end="00:09:49.230" style="s2">and that&#39;s very very important because</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.230" end="00:09:51.060" style="s2">there are wait there I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.230" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">sort of three areas in which this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.060" end="00:09:56.190" style="s2">huge issue one is all of the information</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s available to me right now we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.190" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">to talk about this later</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:01.770" style="s2">but technically mathematically the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.880" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">amount of information is available in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.770" end="00:10:08.850" style="s2">this room is astronomically vast and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:11.130" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t make use of all of it I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.850" end="00:10:12.900" style="s2">get overwhelmed by it so part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.130" end="00:10:16.380" style="s2">have to do is select out of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.900" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">information what information I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.380" end="00:10:25.530" style="s2">to make use of I also have a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:27.660" style="s2">of information in my memory overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.530" end="00:10:31.290" style="s2">its vast and the possible ways it could</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.660" end="00:10:36.780" style="s2">be connected I have to select from some</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.290" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">of that and then I have to put those</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.780" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">pieces of information together in all</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">the ways I can put together the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">information and from out there and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:45.990" style="s2">information about here also vast and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:47.730" style="s2">overwhelming later on I&#39;m going to give</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.990" end="00:10:49.620" style="s2">you mathematical arguments about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.730" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">right now I just need you to get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.620" end="00:10:55.770" style="s2">intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:58.530" style="s2">so what consciousness is doing right is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.770" end="00:11:00.990" style="s2">it&#39;s helping these problems it&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.530" end="00:11:03.450" style="s2">you zero in on the relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.990" end="00:11:06.180" style="s2">the relevant of information from out</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.450" end="00:11:09.210" style="s2">there the relevant information from in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.180" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">here and the relevant information that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.210" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">will help put those pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:16.420" style="s2">information together for you in the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:19.329" style="s2">that it&#39;s needed just like you do</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.420" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">that you do that with your computer you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.329" end="00:11:23.560" style="s2">search through your memory you select</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:25.870" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant you bring it on to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.560" end="00:11:28.779" style="s2">desktop you put it together in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.870" end="00:11:33.310" style="s2">relevant manner right and then you use</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.779" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">it in a relevant way but we can&#39;t use a</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.260" end="00:11:47.410" style="s2">your consciousness this helps to explain</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.910" end="00:11:49.959" style="s2">why consciousness is so tightly</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.410" end="00:11:51.880" style="s2">associated with working memory and</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.880" end="00:12:02.949" style="s2">with intelligence okay so the core</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.589" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">function of consciousness seems to be to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.949" end="00:12:09.370" style="s2">help you realize become aware of</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.070" end="00:12:23.980" style="s2">back to this in more depth there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.199" end="00:12:26.290" style="s2">more neuro scientific and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.980" end="00:12:29.620" style="s2">account by people like Bohr and Seth</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.560" end="00:13:04.990" style="s2">but what does what is all of that doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.930" end="00:13:07.060" style="s2">the same thing right the Bohr and Saif</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.990" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">model is basically saying the function</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.060" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">of consciousness is to give you a</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.420" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">theory is not about the function of</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:39.980" style="s2">consciousness but of course he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.360" end="00:13:42.080" style="s2">to give a derived account of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:51.530" style="s2">piece of information in your brain is</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.750" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually complexification</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.840" end="00:14:21.470" style="s2">think there&#39;s much more to consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.550" end="00:17:46.190" style="s2">me and what does that mean for me well</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.640" end="00:17:47.990" style="s2">first of all I&#39;m picking out of all of</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.660" end="00:18:18.440" style="s2">overwhelmingly vast but you pick out on</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.140" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">some and then what you do also is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.440" end="00:18:22.940" style="s2">begin so you&#39;ve already selected and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">start to prioritize it and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.940" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">foreground some of it so for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.320" end="00:18:39.290" style="s2">presumably I&#39;m for grounded and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.470" end="00:18:41.180" style="s2">around me is back rounded and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.290" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve already seen it&#39;s going both ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.180" end="00:18:45.590" style="s2">remember that right and notice again</p>

<p begin="00:18:45.590" end="00:18:49.010" style="s2">through and then taking the features and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:50.270" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to foreground them and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.010" end="00:18:53.150" style="s2">I&#39;m going to ghost all those features</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:56.750" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna figure I&#39;m going to create a</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:17.500" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:30.350" style="s2">right and this also is feeding back and</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:41.320" style="s2">and framing problems and framing</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.320" end="00:19:58.270" style="s2">all through this series so you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.490" end="00:19:59.740" style="s2">very complex dynamical system at work so</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.270" end="00:20:01.330" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now is your</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.740" end="00:20:06.630" style="s2">consciousness is creating a salience</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.330" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">landscape some things are rising up</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.169" style="s2">and configured and then you&#39;re framing</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.250" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">problems around them and then things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.169" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">shifting and and your attention is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:22.990" style="s2">shifting around other things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:26.679" style="s2">becoming more Senya you&#39;ve got this</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.710" end="00:20:49.880" style="s2">right so part of what I&#39;m doing I get</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.710" end="00:21:01.909" style="s2">so I move around it I try to get into an</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.909" end="00:21:07.549" style="s2">I lose too much of the dish don&#39;t if I</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.210" end="00:23:50.060" style="s2">optimal gripping gets you into the</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.780" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this process of sizing up</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:27.310" style="s2">and that produces a presence landscape</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.080" end="00:24:36.160" style="s2">you get a whole bunch of a whole</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.140" end="00:24:46.040" style="s2">but that&#39;s not enough remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.910" end="00:24:47.920" style="s2">about with flow you need to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">two-year-old and they got the spoon and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.550" end="00:25:33.280" style="s2">right and what do they pick up the spoon</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:40.210" style="s2">they drop it before you pick it up they</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.280" end="00:25:44.429" style="s2">pick up and they and they do this over</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.210" end="00:25:48.850" style="s2">and over again why are they doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.429" end="00:25:51.970" style="s2">because they&#39;re trying to use their</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.679" end="00:26:00.490" style="s2">they doing why do they repeatedly grasp</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.790" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">doing it right now it&#39;s laying out right</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:36.970" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all of this is a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:39.820" style="s2">consciousness is helping you zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.970" end="00:26:43.090" style="s2">relevant information it&#39;s creating this</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.820" end="00:26:45.429" style="s2">textured salience landscape so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.090" end="00:26:47.260" style="s2">certain things stand up stand out for</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.179" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">then within that it&#39;s creating a</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:03.340" style="s2">salient are being Co identified right</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.040" end="00:27:06.490" style="s2">coupled together into an array a agent</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.490" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">also affording you and that&#39;s dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.679" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">because the affordances are constantly</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.970" end="00:27:23.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what consciousness is doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:35.310" style="s2">so if I were to transform my</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:38.010" style="s2">consciousness I&#39;m gonna be transforming</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.630" end="00:28:05.040" style="s2">dot problem I will have a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.230" style="s2">look on an altered state of</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.230" end="00:28:14.970" style="s2">in consciousness it&#39;s an insight of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.830" end="00:28:19.380" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s a it&#39;s a radical</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:33.060" style="s2">I&#39;ll try it and show you what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.810" end="00:28:34.700" style="s2">this by a systematic insight so this</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.060" end="00:28:38.750" style="s2">goes back to childhood development</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.700" end="00:28:41.250" style="s2">pivotal work of Piaget in psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.750" end="00:28:44.070" style="s2">this is picking up again on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.250" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">metaphors we were using we use wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.070" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">like enlightenment or wisdom is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:50.070" style="s2">waking up and there&#39;s another one wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">like as the child is to the adult the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.070" end="00:28:56.520" style="s2">adult is to the sage wisdom is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">growing up okay so you take a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.520" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">four-year-old and you do this you count</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:02.430" style="s2">up five candies one two three four five</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">you need a four-year-old because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.430" end="00:29:07.590" style="s2">can count they understand that five is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:09.810" style="s2">more than four it&#39;s less than six you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.590" end="00:29:12.540" style="s2">count it out right and then you count up</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.810" end="00:29:18.180" style="s2">five more candies one two three four</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.540" end="00:29:22.180" style="s2">five you show them that like this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.180" end="00:29:26.140" style="s2">you say which which row do you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.180" end="00:29:27.820" style="s2">and they reliably and you&#39;ve counted</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.140" end="00:29:29.170" style="s2">they know there&#39;s five here they knows</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.820" end="00:29:33.250" style="s2">what there&#39;s five here but they</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.170" end="00:29:36.010" style="s2">confidently pick this row and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.250" end="00:29:37.720" style="s2">thing all the kids do it and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.010" end="00:29:39.220" style="s2">mistake is related to a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.720" end="00:29:41.230" style="s2">other kinds of mistakes they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.220" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">they&#39;re not making just a single error</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.230" end="00:29:46.840" style="s2">look this is what made Piaget a great</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:48.190" style="s2">great scientist why he&#39;s a pivotal</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.840" end="00:29:50.200" style="s2">figure in trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.190" end="00:29:53.920" style="s2">development and think about Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.200" end="00:29:57.160" style="s2">and development see there&#39;d been lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.920" end="00:29:59.550" style="s2">IQ testing way before Piaget people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.160" end="00:30:02.340" style="s2">been testing kids our IQ for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.550" end="00:30:06.280" style="s2">they had been throwing away the errors</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.340" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">as garbage because what you paid</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.280" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">attention to was that what the kid got</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">right yeah success and Protestant work</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">ethic yeah yeah Piazza had this insight</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:22.140" style="s2">it is it but wait wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:26.560" style="s2">what if there&#39;s a pattern in the errors</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.140" end="00:30:29.410" style="s2">if the errors are systematic and not</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.560" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">random then that would mean that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.410" end="00:30:31.660" style="s2">are constraints</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:33.490" style="s2">remember constraints there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.660" end="00:30:38.800" style="s2">constraints operating in the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.490" end="00:30:41.140" style="s2">cognition and maybe we could understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.800" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">think about Aristotle again and biology</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.140" end="00:30:48.550" style="s2">cars Piaget was guess what a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:51.670" style="s2">maybe we could understand development in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.550" end="00:30:54.040" style="s2">terms of how those constraints are</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.670" end="00:30:56.890" style="s2">shifting and how they&#39;re how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.040" end="00:30:59.980" style="s2">shaping the kids sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.890" end="00:31:03.070" style="s2">interaction with the world and what he</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.980" end="00:31:05.860" style="s2">found was in fact that the errors are</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.070" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">systematic the kids are all of the kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.860" end="00:31:09.280" style="s2">are making this kind of error and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:11.680" style="s2">they&#39;re making a whole bunch of related</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.280" end="00:31:14.860" style="s2">errors there&#39;s a whole system of errors</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.680" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">and so that points to some underlying</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.860" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">set of constraints now what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:23.740" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here why is the kid</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:26.110" style="s2">picking the the lower row because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.740" end="00:31:30.040" style="s2">takes up more space think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.110" end="00:31:34.900" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve talked about here this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.040" end="00:31:38.030" style="s2">variable is super salient to them</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.900" end="00:31:38.870" style="s2">their salience landscape is only picking</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.030" end="00:31:41.830" style="s2">up on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.870" end="00:31:44.420" style="s2">now you I hope don&#39;t fall prey to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.830" end="00:31:46.550" style="s2">because you&#39;re also picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.420" end="00:31:49.490" style="s2">another variable at the same time you</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.550" end="00:31:52.250" style="s2">also make salient that the extra space</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.490" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">is non candy space and therefore is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.250" end="00:31:58.310" style="s2">not relevant but the kid doesn&#39;t pick up</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:32:01.130" style="s2">on that their salience landscape is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.310" end="00:32:03.380" style="s2">sizing that up and so they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.130" end="00:32:07.720" style="s2">the same affordance as you now notice</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:47.480" style="s2">let me try and explicate this problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.560" end="00:42:53.090" style="s2">further look why do you you reject your</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.970" end="00:43:35.410" style="s2">realness is something like the pattern</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.140" end="00:44:09.620" style="s2">with the rest of their life it tells you</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.589" end="00:44:22.490" style="s2">in fact the difference is so great that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.609" end="00:44:25.190" style="s2">instead of rejecting it you reject your</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.490" end="00:44:27.380" style="s2">everyday experience if you so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.190" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">that you use to reject the drink so look</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.380" end="00:44:31.069" style="s2">at the picture I use all of this and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:32.690" style="s2">reject the dream and then I have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.069" end="00:44:34.789" style="s2">higher state of consciousness again a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.690" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">single thing and I use this to reject</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.430" end="00:44:53.450" style="s2">the higher state of consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.350" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">temporary experience it does not go here</p>

<p begin="00:45:18.970" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">these experiences are traditionally</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">they&#39;re traditionally trans rational you</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2">or justification how is it that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.840" end="00:45:41.630" style="s2">temporary experience that you cut why</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:44.150" style="s2">what was it describe the experience I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:45.980" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t describe it well can you</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.980" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">can&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.170" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s no content it&#39;s temporary and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:58.900" style="s2">yet somehow it goes the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:46:02.750" style="s2">of most altered states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.900" end="00:46:04.790" style="s2">these states these so-called higher</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:25.460" style="s2">reject our everyday experience and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.520" end="00:46:28.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the core of the axial revolution</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.650" end="00:47:06.050" style="s2">how how do we tie this to this</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.470" end="00:47:07.970" style="s2">can we give an adequate enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.050" end="00:47:10.910" style="s2">explanation of these higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.970" end="00:47:13.700" style="s2">consciousness and we need to do one that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.910" end="00:47:16.250" style="s2">will help to explain why triggering them</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.700" end="00:47:16.910" style="s2">can be so transformative because here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.250" end="00:47:19.849" style="s2">the thing</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.849" end="00:47:25.369" style="s2">get better they&#39;re not making it up</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.750" end="00:47:27.800" style="s2">after they&#39;ve had these these higher</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.490" end="00:47:53.750" style="s2">to solve this problem we have to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.230" end="00:47:55.220" style="s2">some progress on it now we need actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.750" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">two explanations that need to be</p>

<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:16.250" style="s2">of these states why do people like when</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:48.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a descriptive account I need a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.180" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">prescriptive account I mean the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.420" end="00:48:51.150" style="s2">account is going to be largely</p>
