<p begin="00:00:02.480" end="00:00:06.720" style="s2">inspirations podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.160" end="00:00:09.600" style="s2">with professor dr yann bonifa and daniel</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:09.600" style="s2">schmachtenberger</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">thank you daniel thank you for being</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:15.679" style="s2">with us today</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">thanks for putting this together we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.679" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">a chance today to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">heart-based medicine during the board</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.039" end="00:00:25.599" style="s2">meeting and during the opening ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">and i just wonder what does heart-based</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.599" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">look like for you if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">describe it in your own terms</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">now the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">kind of sense that i have is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">people are called to a life path in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">healing professions because of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:53.440" style="s2">a care for the quality of experience of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.440" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">and the actual sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">of human life and human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">wanting to be in service to and devotion</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">so heart-based medicine would be where</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">entire system of medicine and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">were designed from and in service to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">that devotion and that sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">so heart based medicine is about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">sacred space for you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">yeah i mean we think about medicine</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">preventing and correcting illness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">promoting health</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">people&#39;s experience of life and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">they can do with their life</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">to affect the experience of others is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">sacred so then medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">what is in service to their capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">experience life fully and contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">life fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">beautiful in many ways this is where</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">medicine is coming from at least in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">part of the world in our cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">medicine was very much in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">the religious missions</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">and that was the understanding of health</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">care that was the understanding of care</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">and of elevating the potential of of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">ones we serve</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">is this something very specific to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">our cultures</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">or is this something that you see as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">like as a principle</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">beyond the kind of cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">religious backgrounds that we share</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">in western europe i think this might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">unifying a thing across cultures as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">there is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">medicine women and medicine men and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">shamans</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">and chinese medicine and ayurvedic</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">medicine led</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">early humans figuring out how do we care</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">for each other how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">care for ourselves how do we prevent</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">illness how do we fix illness</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">obviously the whole focus to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">would be not just self-preservation but</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">also care for each other so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s probably as unifying a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">thing as there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">yeah so care is the unifying principle</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">so it cares the unifying principle and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">see that all the talk in healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">about the importance of care and we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">it is delivered</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">what do you see as the current</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">the strongest obstacles i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">those those elements in our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">system in the way that we go about</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">healthcare what do you see as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">current obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">to deliver the kind of care that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">would perceive as</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">a secret</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">a lot actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m happy to unpack this but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">a lot of systemic factors</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">um there&#39;s obviously trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">dollars flowing through the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">global health care industrial complex or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">at large and pharmaceuticals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">industries and insurance industries</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">there&#39;s also all of the money in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">world flowing through</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:17.360" style="s2">things that affect health when we look</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:17.360" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">the burning of coal and oil and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">that does to the environment that then</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re embedded in and breathing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">drinking the water from when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">look at agriculture that depletes the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">topsoil or sprays glyphosate on all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">like upstream from someone being sick</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">and coming to the hospital is do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">actually have a civilization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">promoting health</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">and how many places do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">civilization that through</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">structures that create ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">psychological stress</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">and structures that actually again</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">expose us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">ubiquitous pollution and poor forms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">when you just think about that like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">the goal of almost every business is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">maximize the lifetime revenue of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">customer</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">and nothing does that better than</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">addiction obviously the the supply side</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">might be a multi-billion dollar company</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">relative to an individual consumer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">kind of asymmetric warfare in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">their capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">influence with commercial media you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">so many things</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">so if we wanted a society that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">promoting maximum health we would want</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">minimizing addiction everywhere which</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">any place where addiction was profitable</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">we would have a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">conflict we&#39;d have a perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">that type of market dynamic so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">you know i think there&#39;s a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">of perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s one place where there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">structural issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">i think that there are places where</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">out of caution because of malpractice</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">and whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">hospitals create policies there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">insurance guidelines that actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">allow doctors to do things that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">demonstrate certain kinds of care</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">i think that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">a medical school system where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">average amount of nutrition that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">taught</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">to a medical doctor is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">low relative to the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">nutrition and health</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">but similarly how much psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">should actually be taught so that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">doctor can actually really understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">the experience of the patient well and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">be able to relate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">work through that should be a much</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">bigger percentage of the training</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">that occurs i think we also have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">situation where</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually measure the felt</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">sense of love and care in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">that you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">cholesterol and blood pressure and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">you end up optimizing for the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">that you measure</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">i think mri machines are expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">they&#39;re important</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">so you make big hospitals that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">people go to as opposed to small county</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">clinics</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">and because there&#39;s economies of scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">but i think the economies of scale mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know your doctor your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">doctor doesn&#39;t know you you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">maybe hundreds or thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">and so i think again the economies of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">end up really damaging personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">connection and personal rapport</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">i think the most important diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">tool there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">is really detailed medical intake</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">and really having the time to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">through and pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">and then a continuity of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">think about that for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">the patient and there&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">requires a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">time being allocated so i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">of structural factors that are oriented</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">to things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">lowering liability and maximizing profit</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">and economies of scale all of which are</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">not optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">what supposedly the whole thing is in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">service to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">hmm thank you that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">can resonate very much with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">importance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">intake that is based on a deep listening</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">really being present with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">understanding where they&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">and seeing their disease through their</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">where you&#39;re talking about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">touching on many issues but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">touching on one of the points you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">raising</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">is that the person&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">experience of their disease</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">and how they feel and what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">their lives</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">is something that is worth exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">yet it is hard to measure</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">so the measures that we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">are they too crude or are they just is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">structurally impossible to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">well by by definition it is structurally</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">impossible to measure</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">subjective experience a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">means some needle move means it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">domain of the objective or third person</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">i can measure a neural correlate</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">i can measure a endocrine correlate</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">otherwise i have to actually listen to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">the person report their own experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">then of course we&#39;re going to have all</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">the biases that self-reporting has</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">and someone having reasons they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">want to say how miserable they are or</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">they want to exaggerate it for empathy</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">they have a limited vocabulary to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">express it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">so i do think that there is a need for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">lot of question asking of things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">measured in blood tests so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">deal with this approach so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">we know that when we talk to patients</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">that we find out things and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">there are biases so there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">preferences there&#39;s recall</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">things that affect this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">and a lot of the approaches that we take</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">in in everyday</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">routine clinics is trying to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">insert some objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">into this assessment seeing to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">degree can we rely on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">but in a way what we do is we take our</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">tests that we apply our observations</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">of that person that we call objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">observations</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">we take those as the reference point and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">whatever the patient says</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">is measured against that yet when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">then what we really want to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">want to improve on understanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">the subjective experience better</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">parts we can look at here</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">there&#39;s the way that someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.480" style="s2">affects their objective physiology right</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">so the whole domain of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.480" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">psychoneuroimmunology and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">stress affects health and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">better psychological disposition placebo</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">dynamics et cetera effect health</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">so we want to actually be able to work</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">with people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">subjective experience as part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">medicine that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">the other thing is that some people</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">might have a disease that can&#39;t be cured</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">and actually still have a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">subjective experience of life based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">their focus and their meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">versus having a totally ruined</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">experience of life so subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">experience is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">a terminal value in and of itself it so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">it is both useful for</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">supporting objective physiologic health</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">it is intrinsically valuable independent</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">of physiologic health um there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">of other reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">talk to a patient and ask them questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">though um</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">you and i were talking before that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.839" end="00:11:55.920" style="s2">modern allopathic medicine does a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">good job in places where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.920" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">understand the causation clearly</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">and generally that tends to be more in</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">the direction of things that were acute</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">like an acute injury it&#39;s pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">there was a puncture wound we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">sew up the puncture wound or</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">there was an acute infection and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">see what type of infection it is maybe</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">symptomology and we can trace causation</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">they have a lot of causes and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">make one more susceptible to the</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">more until eventually we cross a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">threshold and now we get symptomology</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">and a cluster of symptomology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">biomarkers gets a disease name</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">and but if if i really start paying</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">attention to those things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">wanting to be able to trace a complex</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">and maybe very delayed causation in time</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">then i want a totally different kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">right i might want to be asking really</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">detailed questions to see when they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">ever been exposed to mold</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">or when they were ever exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">industrial chemicals or they spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">of time with epoxy at a certain point or</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">whatever it is or when they had third</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">world travels where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">got nasty infections and what symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">so i want a timeline of when</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">different symptoms kicked on and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">timeline of different kinds of stresses</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">and exposures when there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">micro-traumatic brain injury that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">show up in an mri but it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">that there actually wasn&#39;t a micro tbi</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">that affected functional patterning in</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">and if i&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">look at the current symptomology the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">current labs</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">the progression of symptomology and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">progression of exposures and have all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">that fit together and make sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">then i might be informed as to how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">start a treatment that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">addressing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">more than just symptomology and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">disease manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way i&#39;m going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">without asking them a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">so so is there do you do you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.839" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">this is an area of research that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">developing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">i mean i think that the</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">communities have been focused on with</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">the best modern treatments are mostly</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:18.079" style="s2">symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">um you know and not not just symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">a biologic</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">can actually decrease the</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">and obviously if we&#39;re cutting a cancer</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">out or radiating it out or poisoning it</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">it&#39;s still better than leaving it there</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">oftentimes but</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">why was there increased carcinogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">and why did the body&#39;s immune system not</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">deal with the carcinogenesis are still</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">upline questions especially if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">want this person to get cancer again</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">and especially if the things that might</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">have led to it might be signs of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">underlying dysregulation that affect</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">um it is just a kind of deeper</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">radically complex regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">many different</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">things that present like a cluster of</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">that is very fascinating as i think in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">most of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.959" style="s2">research that we see published today</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">most of the clinical research is listed</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">that we see published today what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">observe is that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">the schematic the methodology is very</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">much the same so we kind of have two or</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">two points of observation</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">and between the two points of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">observation we assume a linear</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">correlation</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">but what we don&#39;t look at are you if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">look at the classic table one in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">publication where</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the demographics</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">comparing the two groups</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">you know three or four or five different</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">variables so we&#39;re looking at you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">you know gender ethnicity age</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">so like really really crude variables</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">and at the end everybody feels</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">comfortable that both groups are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">comparable</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">well what we&#39;re not looking at at all is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">what happens before</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">the trial what are these life stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">what is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">what is this the the complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">of um homeodynamic regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.039" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">interacting with each other and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">building up in a way that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">great difficulties to understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">measures or markers for this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">when we establish these let&#39;s say if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">get better at asking</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">questions and really getting at least a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">reported picture of what happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">do you feel that the if we basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">exploded the number of variables from</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">you know age and sex and ethnicity to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">maybe let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">200 or 500 variables so if we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">compiling this of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">of measures or indicators</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">would we really learn more about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">happened before</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">an event um</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">what are the right methods to gain the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">kinds of insights we want in a domain as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">complex as human physiology</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">is a very interesting question if we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">look at a clinical trial</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">say for drug research that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">see does this drug do something</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">beyond the placebo</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get something like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">gaussian distribution</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">where all we you know it&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">pretty well for some people</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to work not well for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">other people and there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">range of effect for a lot of people we</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">just want to see that that some</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">range of effect and maybe the front of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">the bell curve is better than what a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">placebo is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">but why it works really well for these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">people and not really well for these</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">people or maybe even really badly for</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.280" style="s2">these people is a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">variables that are just hidden under the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.280" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">shape of a bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">and so obviously we would like to find</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">that out so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">worthless study that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">but it it if we go</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">all the way to the other end we get</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">how can we get as much information about</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">this one person as possible rather than</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">this one drug across all people right</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">how can i get as much information about</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">this person</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">and now we&#39;re starting to do n equals</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">one kinds of studies and optimization</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">so i totally think there are places for</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">clinical trials of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">if we have more metrics if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">appropriate metrics</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">additional insight comes because not</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">just are you likely to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">more things but you also start to get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">see what are the relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">these metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">are there combinatorial insights</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">but as soon as i realized that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">just looking at a genome i&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">the combinatorics</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">on all of the polymorphisms possible on</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">all of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">the genes and then all the combinatorics</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">on the epigenome</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">and then the proteome recursively</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">changing it we&#39;re never going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:32.840" style="s2">to compute all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">it is actually not computable</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">so there are better ways we have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">how do we actually understand what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">health is and if we think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">health as the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">so the homeodynamics of how the body</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">self-organizes and self-regulates</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">and the homeodynamic not just the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">homeodynamic state</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">but the homeodynamic capacity right like</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">typically most of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">studies that most the tests we do in</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">medicine are testing state</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">so we&#39;re testing cholesterol level or</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">we&#39;re testing blood sugar or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">whatever it is but what&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">to determine the overall</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">health is much more related to under</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">stress how does the body maintain being</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">within a homeodynamic range so</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">you know we do this sometimes with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">glucose stress test or with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">stress echocardiogram and those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">super insightful but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">things we don&#39;t do those with where</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">it might be in range but very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">and could come out of range easily which</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">that the person doesn&#39;t have a disease</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">but they&#39;re very susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">and so yet if i see very high</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">homeodynamic capacity across lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">axes</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a measure of the robustness of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">so yeah different types of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">diagnostics in the future</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">thank you so when we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">so what i hear from you is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">assuming linear</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">uni causal association is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">is a degree of simplification that silly</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">is really not very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">um i mean for some things</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">in the knife wound case it&#39;s fine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">except we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">need to ask you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">are they clumsy or are they getting in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">knife fights for dumb reasons so there</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">might be something upstream</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">but so for some things unicausal is fine</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">but for most anything that emerged not</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">immediately following an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">causation event</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">this is why we don&#39;t actually have real</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">cures we have symptomatic treatments and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">you know ameliorative treatments for</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">most complex chronic disease</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">so the etiology of disease</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">we will more likely find answers for</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">what is the real cause of disease</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">if we look at non-linear models and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">the the period before the dis ease</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">started before the symptoms occur and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">see what what are the different factors</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">that have built up and reached that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">threshold</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">speculate about what might be the areas</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">that affect the human body</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">what are the areas that if they stack up</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">will lead to an imbalance of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">dysregulation that becomes symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">yeah what do you believe are those areas</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">you know there&#39;s some actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">pretty simple models we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">look at this comprehensively through so</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">i mean chinese medicine and ayurvedic</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">actually had some kind of good holistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">heuristics to start with even though</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">assessments we have like say you take a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">roughly chinese medicine point of view</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">of where is there too much of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">or is there not enough of something so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">toxicity and deficiency this is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">starting model for uh predispositions</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">towards disease</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">so uh you can think about that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">evolved to be able to like our</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">our genetics evolved to have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">set of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">interacting with a certain set of</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">parameters so where our</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">behaviors are very different than kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">of what we evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">handle or where our environment is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">meaningfully different</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">those are going to be interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">to look at so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">you know too much well too much can look</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">like things that we shouldn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">amount of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">glyphosate and pesticides and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re really kind of ubiquitously</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">exposed</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">to the volatile organic compounds coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">out of this carpet and out of the paint</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">right there&#39;s we have built a world that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">we&#39;re actually not genetically fit for</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">um where there are externalities to our</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">health of the ways that we do lots of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">and so when you look at all the volatile</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">organic compounds or all of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">petrochemicals that are in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">most of them are either endocrine</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">disruptors or neurotoxins or carcinogens</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">so then we look at how many diseases fit</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">into those being part of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">ideology right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">so too much of things that shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">have really been there at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">and but obviously too much sugar</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">um or you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">there can be excesses of certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">nutrients in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">other nutrients like zinc copper balance</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">calcium magnesium balance or things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">um obviously we&#39;re not just limited to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">uh environmental toxins that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">alive we can also talk about things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">are alive so infection would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">a subclass of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">too much of something and that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">either be things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">should be there but they&#39;re overgrown</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">like sibo and other kinds of microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">disorders or actual infections but</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">pathogens that are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">normally part of our healthy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:28.799" style="s2">microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">and this is where the concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.799" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">subclinical infection or a subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">toxicity is important</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">which is let&#39;s say that i have a level</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">of mercury exposure</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">or a level of lead exposure where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">going to say oh yes i have lead</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">poisoning well lead poisoning is at this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">threshold but the ideal amount of lead</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">that i would have would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">down here well there&#39;s a whole level in</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">here which is i don&#39;t yet have the level</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">that we would diagnose with acute lead</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">that is more than none it has some</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">and that also ends up being true with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">infections that are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">showing up as acute infection</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">but are testable and that have effect so</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">we see helicobacter pylori in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">stomach</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">being able to cause ulcers and cause</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">stomach cancer over a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">or h pv and cervical cancer or throat</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">cancer things like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">for those few that we&#39;ve found recently</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty safe to assume that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">lots more like that where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">correlations are just not as clear yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things that again</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">infectious study and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">toxicology studies that functional</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">medicine is doing i think are really</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">um so too much of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">various things not enough of and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">obviously we can look at things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">not enough exercise not enough sleep not</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">human contact the none of human contact</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">profound because</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.840" style="s2">that ends up being one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">profound</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.840" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">drivers of addiction which is then going</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">to cause so many other health</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">issues but also not enough of specific</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">and we see that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">you know modern american diet</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">or modern industrial world diet is very</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">high in macronutrients and often</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">low in really critical micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">longevity is usually best optimized by</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">lower macronutrients and higher</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">micronutrients which is closer to what</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">evolutionary environments would have</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s like a starting framework</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">so here you have identified areas or</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">risk factors</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">and if they&#39;re compiling they might add</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">so these are the areas that we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">like to explore further and more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">in in an intake as you described it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">where we ask lots of questions and try</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">to understand what happened</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">before the patient has reached a stage</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">of disease</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">yeah when we don&#39;t have a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">when talking to the patients and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">mentioned the the systemic factors the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">limiting</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">factors of how we are setting up our</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">healthcare system certainly i i feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">that limited time is a critical factor</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">we need to make choices we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">choices about what questions to ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">and one way is to go through a protocol</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">one way is to go through a long list of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">questions and kind of ask all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">possible questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">and then i hope that either ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">some computer will be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another way to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">and that depends it involves the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">observer</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">it involves the healthcare provider so</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">it involves the way we show up as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">healthcare provider we relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">patient and we ask these questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">we briefly touched on the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:04.279" style="s2">experience of the disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">and you talk you touched on</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.279" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">homeodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">as as the key principle to understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">behind disease evolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">now if we see that you&#39;re a homodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">system and i&#39;m a homeodynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">is there a way that those two systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">can come into resonance</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">is there a way that i can tune my system</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">into yours and by doing so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">i can actually ask the right questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">i would ask you as a clinician have you</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we have to get hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">wondering what the mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">intuition is to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s a reality to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">is it some electromagnetic resonance</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a cool idea is it simply</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">that i have a lot of experience and when</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">i take the time to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">quiet i process the information in my</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">neurologic database better that&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">idea too</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t really i don&#39;t i actually don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">a mechanistic explanation of how</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">intuition works that someone can</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">say not well enough verified and reject</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">to say that increasing awareness</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">and it will lead to better insights from</p>

<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">and how to ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">the right questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting so you&#39;re leaving</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">care as a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">space and you&#39;re leaving intuition</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">as a sacred space so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">it feels like we need to talk about love</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">in a way connecting the two at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what it feels like to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">here&#39;s another sacred space and another</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">question of can we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">measure or should we measure what might</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">be the value of measuring</p>

<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">and how we describe the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">of love or resonance</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">we talked about this earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t measure love</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">we can measure things going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">physiology</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">when we say that we&#39;re feeling something</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">that maybe statistically correlate to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">some degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">and whether i&#39;m measuring oxytocin and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">other kind of neural hormones and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">neurotransmitters or i&#39;m measuring heart</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">some kind of eeg coherence pattern</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">those aren&#39;t useless things to do like</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">but i could just say</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">pick the right person to marry on paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">whether you have any feelings for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">or not and just snort oxytocin regularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">because love is just oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t resonate with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">or or</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">you know do a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">transcranial magnetic stimulation to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">brain region that we identified as where</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">love is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">happening and there it is um</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:43.760" style="s2">when a parent wakes up who is sick and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">who hasn&#39;t slept in a long time who has</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.760" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">an infant who&#39;s worn out as can be to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">take care of their infant</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">love is motivating them but they might</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">like in the moment and love doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">really feel like a subjective emotion</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">it&#39;s actually something deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">emotion it&#39;s transcendent to emotion it</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">can move them even through emotion</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">and we might not see a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">you know the particular great heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">variability in that moment or</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">whatever it is um so</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">i think it&#39;s interesting to study</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">correlation</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">between physiology and subjective states</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">but i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">if we&#39;re studying it through the method</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">of science and we can do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">with the objective within the method of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">science because that&#39;s what we study</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">things that are measurable</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">and repeatable and experience subjective</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">experience is not immeasurable nor</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">then the temptation is going to be to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">reduce subjectivity to being an</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">epiphenomena of objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">and in doing so then consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">illusory and choice is illusory</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">or their consciousness is real as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">epiphenomena but choice is illusory</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">everything that happens in the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">controlled by particle physics of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">voltage differentials of sodium ions</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the exact opposite of heart based</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">anything right like that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">maximum</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">reductionism and it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">epistemically well-founded it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">category error of seeing that there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">some pretty low degree of information</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">theoretic correlation between objective</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">and subjective pretending that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">and then pretending that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">epiphenomenon of this one because this</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">is the one that we know how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">make causal sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.839" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">um do i think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">to have some way of noticing how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">doctor and how the nurse and how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">feel before they&#39;re with patients</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re paying attention to how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">patients are feeling and they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">attention to the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">totally i don&#39;t think you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">i think you can pay attention to it i</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">that you might have some indices that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">are worth noticing</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">but there will be meaningful things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">can&#39;t be brought into an index and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">moment you do</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re actually collapsing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">very information rich to something very</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">not information rich and you&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">so much information in the process</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">that if if you make your decisions as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">hospital or an insurance company or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">doctor based off the thing that lost all</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">the information</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">and then you normalize this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">we want to do we mess it up</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful so so basically our our</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">simplify questions so that we feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">comfortable to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">so this reductionist approach</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">limits our ability to see just by by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re setting targets</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">to see them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">the dow that is nameable is not the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">eternal dial</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">ultimately good medicine is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">purely algorithmic and our job</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">is not just to try and be robots that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">get data that we just haven&#39;t got good</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">do if this than that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">programs it&#39;s actually not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">not the job that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.320" style="s2">part of the job but that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.320" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">whole totality of the job so there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">something to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">what medicine is that is trans</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">and so then you have to say well if</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">doctors and if we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">evaluating them based on a set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">metrics and the scorecard so then they</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">going to try and perform to the</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">actual thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">this is what the note this is how i</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">interpret what the no false idols thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">is about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">right is that that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">kind of graven image of that set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">metrics isn&#39;t actually the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not worthless to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">those things but you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">have your choice making</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">be bound to the actual reality not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">information-reduced model</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting particularly</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">when we think of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">entering the space of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">so when we look at now there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">computers being built that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">are exhibiting some features</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">that we would describe as compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">for example non-just mental listening</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">so some of the robots are now able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">listen</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">to a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">in a way that they there is a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">to the one that that is that is talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">but is non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">this this is um there&#39;s a conflation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">ideas in here</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">to say non-judgmental assumes a binary</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">judgmental that we&#39;re derived</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">we&#39;re correlating our experience of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">human that is judgmental or</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">that computer is not being</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">non-judgmental nor judgmental there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">actually no one home</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">there is no quality it is doing an if</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">this than that kind of program</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">and even if it&#39;s doing a deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">program it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">simply a fully causal input output</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:22.920" style="s2">through some set of program dynamic so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not really fair to call that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.920" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">it is doing a function he&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">it&#39;s told</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">and the the interesting observation is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">when um people with certain disease</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">conditions for example autistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">people are interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">these computers there seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">trust or acceptance that evolves</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">and that those</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:40:00.560" style="s2">patients exhibiting features that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">would describe as autistic disease</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">will reduce and they will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">open up and actually start a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">i think that that is a statement of how</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">shitty the parenting is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">and how shitty the doctors nurses and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">educators are that the person does</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">better with a robot</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">like a fairly low-level robot rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">than it is something exciting about ai</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">for me um if someone&#39;s doing better with</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">a robot because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">simply doesn&#39;t seem judgmental and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">takes a little space even though it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t love you or care about you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">like that&#39;s just a really low bar i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">rather the person have a dog</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">to spend time with the thing i&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">with ai in the medicine space and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s confusing to even call a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">machine learning do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">have machine learning run big data sets</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">to find correlations that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">currently find of course that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">do we want to like scan all the medical</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">in you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">medical records in using image</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">recognition and run massive big data so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">that we can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">early disease indicators we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">currently know that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">insofar as and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">and of course we should be augmenting</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">just like we augment human memory with</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">books and computers we should augment</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">human</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">so the ability to take a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">something and have image recognition be</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">able to do better</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">diagnosis of skin is like all of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">and that actually allows as that gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">better it allows the doctors to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">be less focused on just memory and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">computation and more focused on actual</p>

<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">to them know how to use that system and</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">but there&#39;s still going to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">big gap between the doctor relating with</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">with this person and providing that</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">development of these technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">is awesome and liberating and helpful</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about the way we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">are relating to it that is gruesome</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to understand both in</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">as we&#39;re talking about a robotic</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">exoskeleton that can allow a paralyzed</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s just an extension of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">tooling we&#39;ve already been using</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">um you&#39;re wearing eyeglasses that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">that helps you you&#39;re a cyborg to some</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">degree um</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">if we had ones that could autofocus and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">do cool stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">okay that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.839" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">something that does not actually have</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">the capacity to care about you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">replacing a dynamic where care used to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">occur is tragic</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">now if it&#39;s simply helping you get some</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">stuff done you couldn&#39;t otherwise and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">hopefully that increases your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:30.920" style="s2">for authentic human interaction awesome</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">that the tendency of hyper</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">almost all of the time when the news</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">goes and checks the neighbors say</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">yeah he was super quiet he kept to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">himself nobody ever saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">because in a setting where you have a</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">village where humans evolve for most of</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">and if you&#39;re interacting with other</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">people to get your needs met other</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">people see that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll actually be responding and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">keeping that psychopathology from</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">but if someone can be a shut-in and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">hardly ever interact with anyone and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">maybe get an amazon drone delivery to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">their house so they actually never have</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">to interact with anyone now they can</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.280" end="00:45:23.119" style="s2">have some robotic care agents they can</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">in ways that make them dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">society and in ways that just allow them</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">gruesomely for a long time humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.920" style="s2">our social primates we evolved in social</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:39.599" style="s2">we have a world that totally is getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">this wrong right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">we have to turn that thing around for</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">not just to like have an optimal world</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">i actually don&#39;t think we have any</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">from the point of view of existential</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">catastrophic risk if we don&#39;t solve this</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">thing because say someone is progressing</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">in psychopathology and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">upset</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">and the best technology for killing they</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">have is a knife they&#39;re just not going</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">to hurt that many people before somebody</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">takes them out</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">but if it&#39;s an ar-15 they can kill a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">more people</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">with decentralizing exponential</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">technology when that becomes a crispr</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">gene drive pandemic weapon</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">and weaponized drones and etc</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">we just can&#39;t have really</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">disaffected people and that means if i</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">can get all of my needs met without</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">interacting with other humans</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">then either i have to have some top-down</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">state surveillance system like the china</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">which is already a dystopia</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">or how do we have access to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">technological power people will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">and have us be safe vessels for having</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">that much technological power</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">well they have to be no psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">really damaged people</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">and if there are any we have to know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">only way to have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">known that doesn&#39;t involve top-down</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">state surveillance is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.920" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">surveillance that a family does</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.520" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">or a tribe does or community does where</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">my resource provisioning requires</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">interacting in healthy ways with people</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">or unlike the kind of asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">surveillance of the state that is just</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">trying to make sure i&#39;m not a bad guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a symmetric paying attention of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">people that actually want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">i&#39;m doing well</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">so part of the what you&#39;re proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">a community surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">in a way so you&#39;re saying basically that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have to be developed</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">it&#39;s an innate function of building</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">um primate communities that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">resonating with each other and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">we&#39;re realizing if somebody is behaving</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">kind of outside of the pack then then</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">that is something to be addressed and is</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">would you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">argue that this is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">like an existential</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">interest of the group because of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">potential so is this like a risk</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">detection system of a group</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">does this mean that nobody can be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">hermit no of course it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">nobody can be a hermit</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t mean that in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">presence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.359" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">decentralizable catastrophe level</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">we have to think about some things</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">differently than we did previously</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">and the disposition and well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">matters more to everyone because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">one-to-many capacity of a person is much</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">much higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">and so the coupling is higher which</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">means that the care needs to be higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">we&#39;re coming back to care again and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">again and again so now we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">care as a group phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">so a group caring for the group</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">and caring for individuals for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">of the group</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">and for the sake of the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">for the sake of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">so if i&#39;m just translating this to the</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">where we have a group of people working</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">together and we have individuals walking</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">in and out of this setting</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">and we look at the current</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">i want to call it epidemic of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">suicides in you know among our</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">colleagues</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">numb has the system numbed ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">have we lost</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">you&#39;re specifically talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">suicide amongst doctors</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i haven&#39;t studied this um i</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">would want to really look</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">at is suicide much</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">higher amongst doctors than other</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">professionals of the same pay grade</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">and other types of similar stress level</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">um like i&#39;m sure again there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">be complex causation that&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not one thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">why there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">epidemic suicide issues society-wide</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">um but yeah i wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">speak to with doctors without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s pretty easy to see at</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">least some things</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s pretty easy to see that um</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">the amount of stress doctors go through</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">even in med school right experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">burnout or being on um</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">some kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">wellbutrin or adderall a ritalin or some</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">kind of upper just to make it through</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">school by the time they&#39;re just not even</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">graduating</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">and then they&#39;re supposed to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">whole career of that and like you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">mentioned 72 hour shifts and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">i also think that not having a place to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:58.559" style="s2">process the emotionality of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">the desensitization of okay so i just</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.559" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">you know was a part of some kids dying</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">today this experience and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go do it tomorrow and where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">space for that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">um yeah i think i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">obviously a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">of stresses both that are unavoidably</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">endemic to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">profession that need to be processed in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">ways that they aren&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.040" style="s2">processed</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">and ones that are avoidable by changing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.040" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">the way the system works</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">so we could as a group become more</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">proficient</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">in detecting the dynamics of the group</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">and taking care of each other and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">we could become more proficient in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">way that we show up as an individual in</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">the group</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">and that showing up more proficient</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">with our peer group with our teams and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">will help us to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">see the patient better see our</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">colleagues better</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.160" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">and that might create a community that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">is kind of mutually supportive</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">in a way that we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">not so much cluttered by by knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">and red tape</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">but we can actually allow ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">activate</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">our natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">capacity to care and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">and our um i feel like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">to allow ourselves to be authentic in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">our natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.079" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">state of being and connected that level</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s interesting when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:48.079" style="s2">group care between doctors colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">when when someone that we know commit</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.079" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">suicide</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">it&#39;s such a important inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">especially if we didn&#39;t know they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">close</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">it&#39;s an important inquiry to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">that you actually don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">how close anyone you&#39;re talking to ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">is to committing suicide</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know how close to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">threshold they are and how your</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">interaction is going to affect their</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">relationship to that threshold</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">and simply being aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">changes the importance you put on how</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">you show up in all the interactions so</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">well we&#39;ve come a long way in looking</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">taking a big circle</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">starting in what does it what does</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">and uh we&#39;re ending on a note of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">important it is to develop a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">for each other and to be present with</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">and to know and and how in</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">in so how many ways this this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">finds reflections in our diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">capacity in the way we devise treatments</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">in the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">we want to create a healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">that uh overcomes the many limitations</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing at the moment towards</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">a system where people will feel seen and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">heard as human beings rather than being</p>
