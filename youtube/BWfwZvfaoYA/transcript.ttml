<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:40.879" style="s2">and teach us about sense making itself</p>

<p begin="00:00:40.879" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">a student of buckminster fullers started</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">his parents would read him synergetics</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">um and he&#39;s kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">doing</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">for uh bucky fuller institute where</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">people could learn good</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">sense making tools and be able to apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">them so i&#39;m just really delighted this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">happening now i think it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">service yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.439" style="s2">they met a great time so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.360" style="s2">explore scents making today</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">uh could you kick us off with just</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">telling us some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">core principles of sense making and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">we can maybe apply that to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.960" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">global crisis it&#39;s a funny way to see a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">conversation like principles of sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">making and the reason we use a term like</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">sense making is how do we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">the world and reality that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">which is kind of a uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">common vernacular for epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">how do we go about knowing things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">what is the basis for appropriate belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">in something and this obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">not only the basis of the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">science which is how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">knowing objective things about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">objective world</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">but all of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">the epistemics of whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">we&#39;re claiming is true about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">anything what is our basis of our truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">claim and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">someone can easily study this field for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">their whole life and scratch the surface</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">of all the good thinking that has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">and our basis for right action in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">world to be effective at anything is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">going to be our basis of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">the nature of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">and the nature of being able to consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">what the effect of a particular action</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">so uh overview of sentence making 101</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">what i hope we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">um share a few principles that are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">valuable start</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">to just add something to the picture</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">that can also inspire people if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">interested in terms of where they can go</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">um and maybe be able to show the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">application of those to things that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">currently trending questions with regard</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">you know covet 19 global crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">attendance out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">world issues that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to assume</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">also that the basic philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">and kind of basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">karl popper uh sensibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">kind of understanding of logical</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">fallacies and critical thinking is at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">least somewhat familiar</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">and if that&#39;s not true then</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">take a look at those terms that i said</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">and at least go read the wikipedia page</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">on them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">um logical fallacies critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">popper those would be starting places</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">those are by no means an</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">adequate frame for sense making but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">are common</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">valuable frames good starting places so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">i&#39;m going to kind of assume those and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">build on there</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">uh if i use terms that you think would</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">be unfamiliar please</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">stop me and we&#39;ll unpack them</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">the difference between science and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">epistemology writ large just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">say it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">uh science is an epis the method of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">science is an epistemology it is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">process of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">about the objective world we find</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">ourselves in meaning objects that can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">measured</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">and then where we can do repetition on</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">measurement and then be able to abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">patterns from those</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">but measurable things are third-person</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">things right we can all</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">measure something independently get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">same type of measurement and then be</p>

<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">so measurable and replicable science</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">exists within the domain of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">unmeasurable there are a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">a neural correlate and you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">anywhere close to actually measuring all</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">the things that are happening we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">even begin to understand how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">we can do very rough</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">uh you can&#39;t measure the inside of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">black hole you can mathematically infer</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that are real</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">that are unmeasurable which means</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">they&#39;re formally outside of the domain</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">of science but that doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">that any claim about them is equally</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">true right there are still methods</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">of uh sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">that are going to be more reliable than</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">and then replicable there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">things that are measurable but not</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">replicable because</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not a control kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">where we can replicate it</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">so formally the thing that we call</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">science the processes of science</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">exists within one of four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">in which the real includes all of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">so when we talk about sense making we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">including all of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">and uh so science is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">but not sufficient and it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">becoming actually bad epistemology when</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">you collapse</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">the real to the objective right because</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">subjective is not real if you make real</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">an objective synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">subjective is also real but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">measurable and you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">repeatability on the non-measurable</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">things right</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">intersubjective things are also not</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s actually a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">different quadrant of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">uh things and even some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">objective or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">properly measurable um or where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">causation but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">way to assess necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">causation in a formal way there&#39;s nexus</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">causation like in</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">complexities we have to apply different</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">kinds of principles so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">um and this is when you hear people talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">about the problems of reductionism right</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">trying to reduce all of the real to the</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">trying to reduce complex situations to a</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">very useful reductionism is super useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">but it also has limits and so it would</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">be bad sensemaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">to use reductionism without</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">understanding its limits it would also</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">be bad since making to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">reject reductionism in a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">now when we&#39;re looking at social</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s and trying to make sense of</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things where we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">really be able to measure what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">on there&#39;s information that our</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">consequence to what&#39;s happening now and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">we want to figure some stuff out that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have the ability to do</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">why are certain agents doing the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">they are has to do with intent which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">outside of measurability we can only</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">measure the effects of it and try to</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">so sense making of what&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">and how do we know and how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">enough confidence to inform right action</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">and when do we not have enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">confidence to inform right action and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">a clear basis for what our confidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">margin is and what our confidence margin</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">this is like kind of how you start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">think about what the topics that sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">making is addressing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">are i&#39;ll actually speak about confidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">one of the things oh well actually come</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">one step back</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">the essence if you wanted to say there</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">was an essence</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">the essence of good sense making</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">is earnestness in the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and in earnestness it</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">both wants to know what is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">wants to believe something in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">and an earnestness that is willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">the work that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">to actually come to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">rather than jump to premature beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">because that is comforting or allows you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">to be part of an in-group or seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">knowledgeable or whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">kind of brings us back to a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">things we&#39;ve learned both in ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">in rapid prototyping just like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">importance of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">humility and curiosity you know of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">of not being attached being maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">committed to something</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">but not attached to what it may be um</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">in the case of rapid prototyping and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">then in the case of ecology yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">kind of humble and curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">world around you and seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">in more of that kind of dynamic as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">so curiosity and humility and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">earnestness these words all kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">together here right</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">and um so it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">a very nice definition of science</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">eddington gave that science is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">earnest endeavor to put into</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">order the facts and experience so what</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">are the facts of experience how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">and like what are we what am i</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">experiencing what are others</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">experiencing can i trust that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">recording the facts of their experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">you know in an adequate way and how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">we put into order some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">sensibility of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">um so if earnestness and like</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">depth of curiosity is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">essence of science and epistemology in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">then bias would be the enemy of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">and bias can come from lots of sources</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">it can come from wanting to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">an in-group that believes a thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">where it&#39;s costly not to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">things you&#39;ll be excommunicated from</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">your religion or</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">seen as a conspiracy theorist or a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">status quo or whatever it is that your</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">as bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create a source of bias</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">if you want to be seen as in the know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">because you have particular kind of ego</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">identifications or you want the previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">thing that you did your phd on</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">and got famous for to keep being right</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">might suggest</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">otherwise right ego stuff can obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">be a source of i want this to seem true</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">whether it actually is true or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">financial interest is probably the main</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">thing that messes science up</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">because somebody&#39;s funding the science</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">and typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">that funding is coming from some</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">existing pool of money that made the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">money by doing something that makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">that is going to fund stuff that makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">it more money so it is not interested</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">in things that are not going to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">money it&#39;s interested in things it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">probably will</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">and that means that either self dealing</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">self dealing and you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s totally possible that someone is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">doing science in a way where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">doing authentically bad science because</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">of financial interest they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">um hiding data and whatever but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">also possible that someone does</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">quote-unquote good science</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">but that where the preponderance of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">evidence is misleading because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">only looking at the parts of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">that have profitability so if i look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">pharmaceuticals for instance</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">and the research into healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">doctors currently because the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">landscape in the u.s aren&#39;t allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">prescribe something</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">if it is not fda approved to prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">that thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">fda approval process requires phase 3</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">clinical trials that cost most of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">who&#39;s going to pay for that well a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">pharma company can pay for it if they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">can make that money back</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">and make enough money back so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">to make that much money you have to look</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">at a patented thing because otherwise i</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">put in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">the research money i put in the billion</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">dollars and then i&#39;m selling something</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">competing on the margins with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">people that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">make the thing at the same cost and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.920" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the upfront billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">so i&#39;ve got to be able to recoup that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">money by having a much higher price that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">nobody can undercut me</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">so we can only patent synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">molecules for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">not things that are in plants or</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">nutrients or whatever so those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">are just never going to get the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">kind of research funding so then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">have a preponderance of evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">these things are more effective than</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">these things but it was because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even necessarily that each</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">study was bad but it&#39;s it&#39;s not well</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">distributed the distribution of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">being studied in the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">reality don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">right and um so that&#39;s another place</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">where bias is going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">uh be able to affect and mess up sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">making so because of that i would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">that we have less real science in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">world than i would like to see and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">have a lot more of the r</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">d arm of capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">this becomes one of the things that for</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">individuals trying to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">world when you&#39;re even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">reading scientific papers</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">trying to make sense of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">papers in a space together trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">make sense of the biases of the authors</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">trying to make sense of the bias</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">associated with the funding</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">looking at the methodology itself these</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">are all things that are worth factoring</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">when trying to make sense of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">i was going to say something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">confidence and certainty</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">one of the major sources of bias is</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">biases do we talk about cognitive bias a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">lot in science and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">like all of these logical fallacies or</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">cognitive bias but a lot of them come</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">emotional or identity or existential or</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">social kind of needs</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">where believing something actually feels</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">like it is meeting some</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">need or way for me to live so i have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">basis other than just knowing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">true to want to believe something in</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">so a lot of people who are seeking</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">conflate that the way to get security is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">certainty about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">and so they will seek excessive levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">of certainty with an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">process for gaining it because they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">actually have a certainty bias because</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">they&#39;re unsafe if they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">right or</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">so a fundamentalist religion would be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">classic example</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">where i am utterly certain about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">absolute nature of reality the name of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">uh what happens after you die and all</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">this kind of stuff and it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">um that whole idea only</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">came about not that many thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">years ago and before that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">people were just as certain about other</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2"> and uh that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">that particular god name had never been</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">proposed and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">but there is the you can see in the face</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">of the uncertainty and the unknown of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">if someone is not friends with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">if they&#39;re not friends with uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">and they have then</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">where they can&#39;t see they can project</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">scariness into that space</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">then they want to be certain and so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">have faith even if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">epistemically grounded</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually very interesting people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">fear of dark</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s like why is it that i&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">afraid of the exact same environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">when i just can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">than when i could when it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">environment with the same agents in it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m not even somewhere that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">nocturnal animals or whatever like what</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">maybe sometimes that&#39;s warranted but a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:07.759" style="s2">lot of times that&#39;s not warranted right</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">so where does that come from well</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.759" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">if i can see i know there&#39;s nothing bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">if i can&#39;t then my mind starts</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">projecting stuff in there people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">this of dark water of deep water</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">you know where they can&#39;t see in death</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">and unknown in general so it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">to have a bias towards certainty and now</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">that can be expressed through</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">people who are quote unquote using</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">ideas just as much as it can religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">so there are people who are quoting</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">but what you can see is they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">of science as a process of knowing they</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">think of it as a body of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">and that there are these things called</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">facts and that they&#39;re totally well</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">known and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">those people who understand it are right</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">and other people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">not just wrong but stupid and um and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">uh and they you&#39;ll notice that the bias</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">and the nature of their communication is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">to always have pretty high certainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">even it&#39;s just even if it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">high certainty that other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">presenting something that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">like the science they want are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">and so you&#39;re like oh they&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">same bias going</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re plugging in a science</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">uh set of languages rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">religious set</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">now on the same side people can have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">bias towards uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">but these are still biases so this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">classically what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">right and post-modernism said science</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">claimed some that it shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">claimed it actually had the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">epistemology and it had bias going and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">this was specifically in the social</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">where uh whatever victorian white</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">men were looking at the racial</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">superiority of men or</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">the white race or looking for monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">pair bonding in nature because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">victorian ideals when they did zoology</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">or whatever you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">this is actually a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">confirmation bias messing up the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re calling science but being</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">accepted scientific ideals so then there</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">became this idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">that science was just the same as all</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">i&#39;m giving an extreme example so forgive</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">me obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">foucault and daradah were not stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">they didn&#39;t say this but a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">people who don&#39;t read them all that well</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">make this kind of generalization that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">uh that there is no truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">there is no absolute truth there is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">way of knowing what is more true and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">that anyone who claims to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">a more more access to or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">valid process of truth is just some form</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">of imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">and that because science wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">spreading industrialism at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">that empires were using it to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">the lower class and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">kill indigenous people and ruin the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">environment that those are somehow</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">conflated and that then</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">all perspectives on reality are equally</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">valid and we need to listen to them all</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">equally and there are no valid truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">claims</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">this is gibberish right because</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">recognizing that social science is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">subject to bias in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">where you have extraordinarily high</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">complexity and a high basis for bias is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">very different than say</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">physical chemistry that does not conform</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">to it like that&#39;s very very simple</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">and uh doesn&#39;t have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">bias being admitted so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">um and also then the fact that some</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">people did social science badly doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">mean that it can&#39;t be done more</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">earnestly and better</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t mean does it mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">always want to be looking at bias</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">yes in science that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">consider science unbiased yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">but does it mean that all truth claims</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">are equally valid no</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">the social science thing is the um</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">acronym weird weird populations white</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">educated industrialized rich and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">democratic</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a narrative a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">rightfully so narrative that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">the social scientists</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">uh sciences have been studied on weird</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">populations those you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">are kind of readily available</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">in uh industrialized college settings</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">um so that&#39;s one thing that people have</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">been pointing to more and more and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">it&#39;s really important right now for us</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">to kind of just point out like where</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">where are we exhibiting different you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">racist or colonialist perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">but yeah also not throwing out the baby</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">with the bathwater and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">i think that differentiation you made of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">science being</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">a methodology rather than kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">the set of um</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">truth that&#39;s like already known um</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">is really critical you know as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.360" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">putting out the design science</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">you know decade uh as buckminster fuller</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">institute like getting people to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">blend in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">the design thinking with um</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">all that we can um yeah glean</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">and understanding the world through</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">science uh it&#39;s really helpful to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">differentiation so when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">the social sciences here</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">and what we said in the beginning about</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">the measurable and repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">i can measure a chemical pretty well i</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">can do different types of measurements i</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">can use</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">microscopy and spectrometry and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">and then contrast that and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">other people independently can</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">and uh the physical properties the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">chemical properties of it will conform</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">i can&#39;t measure what someone feels</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">or really the nature and nuance and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">complexity of what they think or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">sense of their relationships or their</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">motives are</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">or whole populations or how those change</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">i can observe</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">certain things about the output</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">behaviorally</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">but then i have to infer a whole lot and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">the total complexity of social science</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">way more complex way more variables and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">there&#39;s way more that i can&#39;t directly</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">measure right it is out it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">third person it&#39;s first person and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">second person</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">and so that was absolutely an</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">overstepping</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">of the idea of what would fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">rigorous domain of science and what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">nature of the truth claims could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">um so while it&#39;s true so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">yes it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">stuff that we have excessive certainty</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">of that we shouldn&#39;t it&#39;s also true that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">we can overcompensate and pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">uh the certainty on some things that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">should and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">uh that there are not better epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">processes even if none are perfect for</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">confidence in something so this question</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">of what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">for a particular topic in that domain</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">what is the appropriate epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">to come to us to relative confidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">why do we think that it&#39;s that as</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">opposed to something else</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">and what are the axioms that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">drawing upon and how do those reify</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">what is an appropriate level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">confidence and what is an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">process to come to that level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">to inform certain kinds of action</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">right those are all kind of important</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">questions now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">i&#39;m getting into this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">formally than i thought we would and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">um to get into the more probably daily</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">practical stuff we&#39;ll get there in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">moment and it might go beyond the course</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">of what we can do in this uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">short time but i wanted to say this</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">thing about certainty and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">is a mature relationship to certainty</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a rabbi friend of mine that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">actually first told me this</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">so it came from that background but a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">mature relationship to certainty is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">we&#39;re comfortable having certainty where</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">it is warranted</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">knowing that it&#39;s never 100 but there</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">might be 95 or 99</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">based on the total amount of data that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">we have relative to the total situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re also comfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">uncertainty because if like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">we&#39;re scared of certainty or</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">uncomfortable with it or like on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">other side we&#39;re uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">uncertainty both of those are biases</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.880" style="s2">that won&#39;t actually have us just think</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.880" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">so we want to be friends with</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">uncertainty knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">unknown and actually the unknowable is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">very large infinity</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">and then we also want to endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">earnestly to gain the certainties that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">inform</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">appropriate right action responsible</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">right action where we can actually take</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">responsibility to affect the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">we care about in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t want to be attached to that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">what i think is right but i do want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">be attached to understanding reality as</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">clearly as i can so that i can act as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">effectively in service of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">the good so if i am working towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">helping hunger</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">and i work really diligently and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">earnestly and make no progress and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">people are getting hungry i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">able to say that i&#39;m failing</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">right like i it&#39;s it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">and then i want to be able to say i</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">should do something different</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">rather than continue doing that thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">because i actually am result oriented</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">not just processor i actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">the people getting fed</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">or the chronovirus getting solved and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">i want</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">to make sure that the pro that my</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">that informs what i think would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">effective that informs the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">things that i try that then i re test to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">see are they working is actually working</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">okay that&#39;s all very basic but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">still worth kind of framing up</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">um i think we can get into how does</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">what are good tools of episemics but</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">i think the place where maybe the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">value can be harvested the fastest is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">what are the most common places where</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">people mess up</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">like how do you you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">sense making badly if yeah i think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">would be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">especially in this moment as we are all</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">make sense of this crisis and what it</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">and you know a lot of people in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">course looking to like</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">what is the opening that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">provided by all of this right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">wanting to step into that without being</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">tone deaf too</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a theme that a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">are looking into</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">um and part of that is just making sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">yeah making the tragedy worse</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">okay so with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">that you know the tragedy worse is there</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">an opening to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">the better and worse are not what we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">normally think of as epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">questions they&#39;re ethical or existential</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">right like what is good and what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">bad and but that&#39;s absolutely relevant</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">so there&#39;s bias</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">there and let&#39;s speak to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:01.679" style="s2">so there is a bias that i notice</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">really damaging people&#39;s sense making</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">when it comes to coronavirus and it also</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">damages their sense making regarding</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">climate change and existential risk and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">kind of risk writ large</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">i&#39;m going to oversimplify on purpose to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">start the topic</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">and knowing that i am oversimplifying</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">and we could get into a much</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">richer discussion of it there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to have a bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">that we could kind of flatly call a</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">positivity bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t want things to be really</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">like just doesn&#39;t want to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">think that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">be with it doesn&#39;t want to feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">so wherever their</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">people are claiming that is bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">they&#39;re likely to think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">it&#39;s probably alarmists those are</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">probably people that are catastrophizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">there&#39;s probably some good innovation</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come along that will</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">solve it like they</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a before even researching it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:01.039" style="s2">there is a immediate bias either to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">kind of almost aesthetically repulsed by</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.039" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">it or to move away or to assume it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">probably wrong or probably won&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">whole story</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">whereas when evidence comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">things are getting better or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">that bad there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">instant resonance before doing a similar</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">level of sense making it&#39;s like oh this</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">look see things are getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of positivity bias that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">think is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">worth having and a kind that isn&#39;t worth</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">the kind that biases our assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">what is is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">the kind that is committed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">understanding what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">very very clearly including all of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">negativities that are current and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">negativities that could be the risks</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">so that we are empowered to help make</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">things better and the positivity bias is</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">that i want</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">my thought word indeed to all be working</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">towards making things better which</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">requires understanding what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">that kind of positivity bias is great</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not messing up our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">it&#39;s applying our sense making in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">empowered and constructive way</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m not going to be good at making</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">things better if i&#39;m not seeing what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">so there is a you know when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">the term spiritual bypass but it can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">a psychological bypass or a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">epistemic bypass of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">spiritual idea or philosophic idea or</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">that wants us to not be with the some</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">right so in the kind of spiritual bypass</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">whether it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">well they reincarnated to have they</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">incarnated to have those lessons or</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">their soul</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">chose this or there will be some silver</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">lining in it or god works in mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s some way of being able to say i</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have to feel bad about this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">that otherwise i would feel really bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">about because i don&#39;t feel like i can</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">hold that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">or be with it which</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">is kind of like a pseudo-sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">right one of the things about sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">is that others can be hurting and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">don&#39;t feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">which is why they can hurt others and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">any idea that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">able to not feel bad in the pre in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">presence of others feeling bad is taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">beliefs that are moving us in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">direction of a sociopathy-like</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">set of behaviors so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">when i&#39;m seeing people who are gasping</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">air and dying in that way and their</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">family members can&#39;t even be with them</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">on their deathbed because they would get</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">upset about it right and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">unnecessary and they could have</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">prevented that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">super sad for them and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">super mad at</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">the people that are making choices that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">they for</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">poor reasons that could have prevented</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">it or done a better job</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t want to feel any</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">other way</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">like there would be something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">me if i didn&#39;t feel those feelings it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">would mean that i</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">like i had to be fractured inside</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">i&#39;m speaking to this because i see this</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">rampantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">with people latching on to oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">this new drug it looks like it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">to work before there&#39;s really good sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">making that we know enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">about the drug because they really want</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">oh there&#39;s this great new diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">test oh there&#39;s this one epidemiologist</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">that said it&#39;s really not that bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">oh look there&#39;s this thing that shows</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">empty hospitals maybe it&#39;s really not</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">that bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">and they&#39;ll latch onto that ship before</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">really studying it but reject the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">which means that they won&#39;t be part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">making things better</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">so this is a very common bias and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">course it goes without saying the exact</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">opposite bias is also common</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">which is a catastrophism bias which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">whenever there is something that looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">uh could be that something isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">bad or</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">there might be a solution someone tends</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">to think that it is probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">and when they see anything that looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">like a possible risk they assume it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">probably going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">and they emotionally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s say we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">situation today where the response to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">covet has started to damage the food</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge deal because messing up</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">than the virus itself and we it&#39;s a big</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">inexorable that two billion people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">going to starve no</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">we can still totally do stuff about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">but there are some people who i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">talked with over the last couple days</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">who&#39;ve called me freaking out saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">did you see like there are locusts in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">northern africa and the middle east and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">crops rotting in india we&#39;re losing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">food supply everybody&#39;s going to starve</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">well it&#39;s true there are locusts in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">northern africa in the middle east</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a big deal and crops</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">are rotting in india</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not true that 2 billion people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">going to starve it is true that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">and but what&#39;s happening is that possib</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">typically we want to do worst case</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">scenario forecasting so we can prevent</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t know that it could</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">happen then you don&#39;t see what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">escalation pathways are then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">prevent it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">and but then if we prevent it the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">the positivity bias will say see you</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">were just catastrophists</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">for doing that nothing bad really ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">happens all that bad ever happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">it would have happened had we not done</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">these things it only didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">because we did the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">planning and saw what it took to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">um so i want to do worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">but know that it&#39;s a scenario it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s already happened and then i</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">want to see how to prevent it so i want</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">the positivity to be oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">not towards sense making um so does this</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">make sense on positivity negativity bias</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">and how they mess up our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">definitely especially where there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">high consequence high pain topics</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">yeah yeah and it seems like there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">kind of this through line of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">um kind of like the ego getting in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">of like people want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">the bias towards certainty but a bias</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">towards certainty kind of shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">this way too</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">intermingled with the positivity and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">bias of just people especially right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">because everything&#39;s so up in the air</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">people just want to have some grinding</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">you know and so i&#39;ve seen in myself and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">in others</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">just biased towards okay i want to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">sense of this i want to know</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">you know what&#39;s happening in what order</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">with what time frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">um and i think something that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">in a through line through a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">we&#39;re learning is just like the world is</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">it&#39;s always shifting change is the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">constant and so how can we</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">kind of be more comfortable with not</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going to happen but be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">that state of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">um i&#39;m still widening our view still</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">like facing that with like a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">hunger</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">for knowing as much as that we can yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">and the deeper hunger that is not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">hunger that jumps to false conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">because we want them</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">but it does the hard work that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">to actually endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">towards so you know i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">what you were just saying right i really</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">want to know what&#39;s going to happen what</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">could happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">what the right order of operation should</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">be how we should tend to think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">i i&#39;m working on knowing that stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">that i can scroll my facebook feed and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">read for several hours and have a good</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">sense of those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of like i</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">want to be buff and i don&#39;t want to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">that part like it&#39;s just not going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">work right this so there is an input</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">output equation that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">and like being buff or being able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">play the piano like being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">sense of a topic takes the work that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">and um so now this brings us to the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">well i can&#39;t do that much work because</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not an expert in virology or an</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">epidemiology or an immunology or</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">a industrial sanitation engineer or</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">in uh diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">medicine or in the privacy</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">considerations for contact tracing</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">or in macroeconomics or in domestic</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">politics security or in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">positioning or in</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">supply chains of food how the could</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">i possibly know all that</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">but there are authorities that know this</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to defer to the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">i&#39;m going to cognitively offload that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">now there is a bias in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">people relate to authority that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s similarly oversimplifying</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">has a by some two directions both of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">which are bias which means not clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">which is there are people that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">most of the people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">primary authorized positions are</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">probably trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">which would be a silly thing to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">and other people who assume that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">always untrustworthy and corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">which is also a silly thing to think and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">those are very kind of sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">generalizations that keep us from</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">actually doing sense making because</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not looking at what are they</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">actually saying what is the track record</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">of where they&#39;ve been right and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">on this topic so far and historically</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">and where is there a divergence or a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">convergence of opinions of people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">am i biasing towards some of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">because of political association or</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">because of positivity or negativity bias</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">or things like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">so can i find virologists</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">that are saying oh this is not mutating</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s going to have a worse</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">strain</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">yes can i find other ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">saying oh the next strain is probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">going to be many times worse</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">yes who are experts so how do i possibly</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">make sense of this if i&#39;m not a phd</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">and possibly having less bias than them</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t get a nobel prize</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">saying this thing where you have an ego</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">equally gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">yeah you know hanlon&#39;s razor is a</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">you know yeah our trust has been broken</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">and then we like think you know they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">out to get us</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">um i think it can be a waste of precious</p>

<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s very strong bias in both</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">directions when it comes to conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">conspiracy are there times where some</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">like that is the nature of the world now</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">does and so like for every watergate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">enron there&#39;s a million of those that</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">machiavelli told everyone to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what sun tzu and the 36</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">stratagems that&#39;s what military theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">and political theory is all about right</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">conspire with some in group to advance a</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">also just hide it better</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">so you know our lovely previous democrat</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">president we</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">bombed a lot of civilians to death</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">military the world&#39;s ever known</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">um but it wasn&#39;t here right and factory</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">farms are as brutal as</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">anything has ever been and their mass</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">and so we should not wrongly assume that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">we are more civilized than we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">and that there is not a ton of</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">coordination is actually fairly hard and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">very often it is just incompetence and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">or the nature of the incentive systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">so assuming any of those things means</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">and so this is what i want people to</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">actually look at the data on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">very closely and carefully</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">whatever but being concerned about what</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">benign china hypothesis was gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">if you read the hundred year war uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">and you look at the activities of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">chinese communist party there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">absolutely global agendas it would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">silly to think otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">now he wasn&#39;t right out of nowhere he</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">was right because</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">bannon and others happened to give him</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">insight there and it happened to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">that as just kind of a deal maker kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">of guy when he sat across from them</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.040" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">he probably had the sense of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2"> it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">these guys are playing some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:06.400" style="s2">serious game that i</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">some some go game that i don&#39;t feel well</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.400" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">set up for</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">now he&#39;s been wrong about a gazillion</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">and so again wanting to over norm that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">he&#39;s wrong and stupid and evil about</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">everything or right and the savior on</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">everything is not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">now of course it&#39;s fine if i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">sense make there might be some people</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">who are right often enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">that i look to them as sources of higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">signal lower noise up front but i still</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">check</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">and there might be other people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">even though they&#39;ve been right a couple</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">times i assume it&#39;s probably low</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">signal enough that i generally don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">check but i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">generalize on that in consequential</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">so hydroxychloroquine i&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">this is a very good example of where</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">sense making is tricky</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">where it&#39;s consequential</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">so hydroxychloroquine is a anti-malarial</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">primarily but it also has antiviral</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">properties has been used as an antiviral</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">and is used in rheumatology uh heavily</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">rheumatic conditions it&#39;s a drug that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">been used for many decades</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">very heavily since vietnam the united</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">states military has put</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">most u.s soldiers on it before they</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">deploy to areas that have</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">malaria as a malarial prophylaxis so</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">before they go to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">every week for the first four years of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">my life because they lived in ivory</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">coast</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">yeah exactly and um</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.280" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">so we have a pretty enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">data on the long-term effects and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">safety and the whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">of hydroxychloroquine is it a totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">benign drug</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">no it&#39;s not vitamin c uh it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">absolutely affect hearts</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">this thing called the qt interval uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s contraindicated with some meds in</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">some conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">but do we at least understand the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">contraindications in the general safety</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">profile well especially as a old generic</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">drug that has been around forever and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">been in combination with all the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">drugs and has a generally pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">safety profile relative to advanced</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">coveted infections yes do we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">randomized control trials that show that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s effective</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">placebo can you know double-blind</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">placebo-controlled multi-location type</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">no those are slow those take a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">long time to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">now those are awesome like randomized</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">control trials are totally a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">sense-making tool an epistemic tool but</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">there are a bunch of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">taught that it is the only tool that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">exists to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">of pharmacology which is utter nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">that means that those people</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">are not actually making good sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">the world or thinking they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been drilled in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">uh over norming on one tool because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">happens to be a lovely tool</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">when we can do it and it also happens to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">be the one that the fda wants and so it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">also happens to be the one</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">that you better take if you want a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">maximum security position to have your</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">malpractice not get you in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">so this is another source of bias on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">right what is the maximally defensible</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">is also a major thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">by the time the randomized control</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">trials are done</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">heaps of people will be dead and icus</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">will be overwhelmed and case fatality</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">should we give people drugs that might</p>

<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">based on</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">are there ways of making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">something to enough degree to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">affect some kind of action yes so with</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">regard to hydroxychloroquine i&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">this as an example</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">there were randomized control trials for</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">it in sars</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">sarge cove one right</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">that&#39;s meaningful it&#39;s a different virus</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:46.839" style="s2">this a novel virus</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of similarities in</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">there were randomized control trials for</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">it and other viruses including other</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">there have been in vitro trials on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">very effective on this one on starzqv2</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">and there are a lot of non-randomized</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">control trials but open label trials</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">ones in china one&#39;s in south korea one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">in france the one in new york but then</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">heaps of doctors that are using it that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">are not nothing right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">placebo controlled</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re not nothing now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">there are some things that just placebos</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">don&#39;t really affect</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">right placebos don&#39;t do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.119" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">healing broken bones</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">um and so we don&#39;t need placebo controls</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">for things that don&#39;t really produce</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">placebo effects and so placebos don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">kill viruses now</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">do placebos modulate your immune system</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">to some degree sure</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">right but is there an amount of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">that placebos have on viral conditions</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">statistically so you can remove that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">statistical artifact and then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">still look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">is their uh effect beyond this just</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">statistical artifact</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s like a way of saying hey we</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:00.559" style="s2">can actually kind of make sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">of this here factoring placebo</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.559" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">considerations even if we&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">the placebo control trial</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">um so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">brought a group of doctors together a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">group of mds to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">work on doing a literature review of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">and by itself and in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">zinc and azithromycin and doxycycline</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.040" style="s2">and other things like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">and we looked at the mechanistic trials</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.040" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">in vitro trials the animal trials the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:27.280" style="s2">current open label trials</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">previous ones and we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.280" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">preponderance of data and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">relative benefit to risk</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">in different populations that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">trying to do sense making with all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">the available data</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">factoring the consequence of action and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">inaction now i</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">don&#39;t get malpractice lawsuits for</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">inaction in the same way i get them for</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">action so that ends up being a source of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">bias and a cya you know cover your ass</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">that is different than just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">sense make how do i save the most lives</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">and so i know doctors many of them who</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve spoke with in the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">who gave themselves prescriptions of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine for themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">their family and said this is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">what i do with myself and my family</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">based on all the literature but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">allowed to prescribe it at my hospital</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">because the hospital said we would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">fired for prescribing it because uh for</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">outpatient treatment because of those</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">that hospital policy</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">i believe is gruesomely negligent and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">life-saving</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">now are we suggesting that people drink</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">fish bowl cleaner obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">are we suggesting that people prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2"> to themselves no</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">that you don&#39;t look at heart conditions</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">and comorbidities no of course not</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying is should prescribing</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">physicians who&#39;ve taken a hippocratic</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">oath and who are scientifically literate</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">be given emergency authorization to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">be able to prescribe as they see fit</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">based on the current literature and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">preponderance of data for life-saving</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a good emergency</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">authorization</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">um where they&#39;re not worried about</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">getting fired or malpractice things</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">so that they can actually be focused on</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">doing the right thing here</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">now again with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">there&#39;s pretty good evidence that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">late stage infection it doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">but there are very few antivirals that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">help in late</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">stage infection in the entire corpus of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">and the general rule of thumb with</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">infection as a whole is treat early</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">rather than late because once it gets</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">bad it&#39;s much much harder but especially</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">with viruses is that only</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">in the very beginning do you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">meaningful chance so</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">a lot of people know if you get shingles</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">or if you get herpes a cyclovir can help</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">if you get to it within 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">at most 48 hours after that we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">almost nothing in that time it does a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">if you&#39;re in late stage aids the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">cocktail</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">antiviral cocktail doesn&#39;t help that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">much if you&#39;re in very early stage it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">will prevent disease progression</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">so if you do a randomized control trial</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine or even the open</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">label trials</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">or fda provisional emergency approval</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">for late stage as an antiviral when</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">pretty much no antivirals work late</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">and then you assume what that means</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">about the drug writ large and factoring</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">for early stage that would just be silly</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">that would be going against the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">preponderance of knowledge we have about</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:25.920" style="s2">viral mechanisms and antivirals writ</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.920" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">so the randomized control trials should</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">be for early stage right</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">which is kind of akin to like how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">been testing people we&#39;ve only been</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">testing</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">we predominantly have been testing the</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.839" style="s2">random sampling and so we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">have a good idea of what the denominator</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:46.000" style="s2">is correct</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">so we do need background random testing</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.000" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">epidemiological forecasting and being</p>

<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">but stand on this one for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">so one should we wait for randomized</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.119" style="s2">to be able to make sense of something no</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">we should look at the preponderance of</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.119" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">all of the data the risk</p>

<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">which is why i said we have to have the</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">now would we like to do randomized</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">control trials to get more knowledge of</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">well if we want</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say i wanted to and i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">if i wanted to do that i would set up a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">late stage trial that showed that it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t effective and then over</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">generalize those results across the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">board and i would also</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">set up a late stage trial where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">placebo is vitamin c which one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">major studies is doing right now where</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">vitamin c is widely known to be an</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:22.319" style="s2">effective antiviral and then i get</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:23.760" style="s2">plausible deniability that i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.319" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">good science because it comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.760" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">prestigious university when what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">really doing is info warfare to an</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">advance an agenda</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">so um now we start to get into</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">i struggled through watching this david</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">ike thing the other day</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">it was very painful there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">extraordinarily little signal in it not</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">none but very very little</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">conspiratorial stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">that said</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">so hong kong had almost nobody die</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">because of good response</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:56:00.640" style="s2">and south korea didn&#39;t respond quite as</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">quickly but they responded well</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.640" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">still very few deaths okay well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">littler</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">places islands um whatever well germany</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">is not an island it&#39;s not a little place</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">and their cfr is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">low czech republic extremely</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">vietnam poor</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">poorer relative country doing great</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">well some of those asian ones had sars</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">so they were prepared</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">czech republic didn&#39;t germany didn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">those are both landlocked they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">islands those are you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">democracies not dictatorships</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">could we just not have responded better</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">well we allowed 430 000 people to fly</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">from china since the thing happened to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">the united states</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">because border closing is xenophobic no</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">closing the border to viruses that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">happen to be on people from wherever the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2"> they came from</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">close the border to them coming from an</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">european country if that&#39;s where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">so this is now a place similarly where</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">if somebody jumps to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">the problem is xenophobia or racism</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">they&#39;re not sense making again</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">we should absolutely shut</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">borders during pandemics where</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.040" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">viral transmission is like physically</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.799" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">you should shut borders between counties</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">within states where there&#39;s very highly</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">different distributions of it within the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">counties to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">prevent excessive spread just like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">are we&#39;re stopping the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:22.640" style="s2">transmission between people and people</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">even within the same city right</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.640" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">um so is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">possible that all of the profound</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">getting everything wrong that we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">the who until a few weeks ago telling</p>

<p begin="00:57:37.520" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">all just stupidity and incompetence well</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">that would be impressive</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">it would be impressive is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">that there are some agendas where</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">if things get worse they do better</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">well if the eu that&#39;s already under a</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">gets more tension because some countries</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">it kind of breaks eu apart so that the</p>

<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">says that they would of course have that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">orientation is the way that china would</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">should we actually try to do sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">making on each specific thing itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">rather than do this over generalized</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">thing that unfortunately we can&#39;t do in</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">this particular world</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">of cognitive offloading yes that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">so with hydroxychloroquine we can see</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">okay late stage versus early stage</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">is this really a placebo or is this not</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">a placebo</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">it randomized control trials are</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">desirable are they the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:23.760" style="s2">uh mechanistic studies other viruses</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">what can you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.760" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">tell from another virus to a novel virus</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">um what degree of certainty would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">needed based on the consequentiality</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">these are all examples and there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">a dozen more i haven&#39;t got into</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">of epistemics you would want to think</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">through to know how to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:42.640" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">and that you should favorite ways like</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.640" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">bayesian decision theory like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">different ways to kind of make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">things with probability</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">and um yeah do you have favorite tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">that you like to use</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">i&#39;m upset at the idea of favorite tools</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.559" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">each of them it&#39;s like i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">build a house with a screwdriver</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">screwdrivers are awesome</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:09.599" style="s2">tools that you come back to often all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">and for the things they&#39;re good at so</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">network theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">and graph theory are the best things for</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">the thing that they do and probability</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">and statistics and different statistical</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:24.160" style="s2">mathematics in the domain that it&#39;s for</p>

<p begin="01:00:24.160" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">you know machine deep learning on large</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">you know crowdsourcing versus expert</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">sourcing um</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">when do we use induction and deduction</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">and abduction</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">favorite tool intellectually is as silly</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">favorite tool to try and fix a car or</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">build a house</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">yeah i like wrenches to fix a car</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:57.520" style="s2">they talk to screwdrivers and they suck</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">for welding</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.520" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">and so if someone actually wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">able to fix a car you got to have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">of tools know how to use them and know</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">which one to use for which situation</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">and if someone wants to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:08.960" style="s2">the world same thing and if that seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">like too much</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">then you should just accept the idea you</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">probably won&#39;t understand the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">the reality you live in and be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">make good choices</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">well within that it kind of like it</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:26.799" style="s2">helped i mean it brings up people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">biases of like wanting certainty and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.799" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">wanting</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">um yeah both positivity and certainty</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">come up for</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">in that just like oh can&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">explain it to me in canada i&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve been taught over and over again as</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">like an okay response to the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">well this is the psychology of a child</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">that wants a parent</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">to be able to depend upon yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:53.839" style="s2">um and it&#39;s actually interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to over norm here i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.839" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">want to do bad sense make an over normal</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">topic that is super complex but i will</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">draw a parallel that has at least some</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">truth value</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">the way people related to their parents</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">as kids often</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">reflects itself somewhat in the bias</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">they have towards authorities later</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">their parents and teachers and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">other authorities in childhood</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">so the people that did better in school</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">and did better with their parents and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">kind of did well with the standard model</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">more often than the other crew will tend</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">to think that the standard model is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">well and think that the current</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">authorities are probably trustworthy and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">good and the people that didn&#39;t do well</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">at those things</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:40.240" style="s2">and didn&#39;t have trustworthy authorities</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">are more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.240" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">have that generalized sense right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">not an absolute it can come from lots of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">other things later life events</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">but those are interesting things to look</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">at and it&#39;s also interesting where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">i want someone to just reassure me that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.520" style="s2">everything will be okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">how old is the psychology having that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.520" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and i feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">scared how old is that okay so now we</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">need to do therapy</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">for inner child trauma stuff that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">going to hijack our adult brain being</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">able to make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">and that will make us susceptible to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">other people being able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">influence us more than they should yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">and dangerous authorities and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">start to come into is they can prey upon</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">yeah and i think one of the root causes</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">of so many of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">our interdependent crises right now is</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">that kind of avoidance of</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">that inner work avoidance of it being</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:37.760" style="s2">even okay to talk about those things</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">you know um i mean it seems like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.760" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">a trend towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:43.839" style="s2">you know being okay with therapy or</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">coaching as kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.839" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">therapy like tool that people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">becoming more</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">less stigmatized than it once was</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">people realize that their effective</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">choice making requires effective</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">understanding about both the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">the world and what the effect of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">particular choice or injunction is going</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">then wanting to sense make clearly</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:10.799" style="s2">becomes a very high</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">goal and once they realize that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.799" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">the bad sense making comes from</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">psychological predispositions biases</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">that come from those places</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:23.440" style="s2">then psychological work</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">actually becomes part of sense making</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.440" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">so do you know as much as i might want</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">to learn math or statistics or bayesian</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">analysis i might also want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">be able to do bias assessment and be</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">able to see where those biases arise</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">from and clear them</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">yeah so this moment that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">is an opening</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">for a healing at a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">levels and one of those is i&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">as people are in</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">stressed situations some of their kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">of unaddressed trauma</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">is arising and i think similarly</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">kind of like our unaddressed root causes</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">you know what&#39;s creating the ecological</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">and and climate change and everything um</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s an opening right now for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">to see right like the the true meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">of apocalypse is</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">an unveiling of a greater truth that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">that was unapparent before that moment</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:23.119" style="s2">um so yeah curious to hear what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.119" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">kind of all of that incense making and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">in this moment</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.039" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna share something that i have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.319" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">share a dialectic of things</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">for it to make sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">so where people notice that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.440" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">psychological process that seems more</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">like a child than an adult</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:48.079" style="s2">psychological process i want to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:49.599" style="s2">reassured i want to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.079" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">comforted i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on i</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.599" end="01:05:54.559" style="s2">want to know that an authority is taking</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:54.559" style="s2">care of it or can tell me what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">anything that they do from there will</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:05.920" style="s2">not help</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">if they&#39;re trying to act on the world if</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.920" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">they&#39;re sharing information or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">so the only thing they can do from there</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.000" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">is actually respond</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:17.039" style="s2">to this address their own psychology</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">until they come to a more empowered</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.039" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">place and then from a more empowered</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">place try to sense make the world and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:27.200" style="s2">then act from clear sense making</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">don&#39;t act from those places um</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.200" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">so i really want to see people showing</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">in a adult way</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:37.920" style="s2">but the dialectic with that is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:39.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.920" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">snap your fingers and get there because</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.280" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">you want to there&#39;s work that it takes</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:44.160" style="s2">if the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:45.760" style="s2">if there are unresolved child trauma</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.160" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">type things that keep hijacking you into</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.760" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">state pretending that that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">case and saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">oh yes i feel very calm and centered and</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:54.240" style="s2">i&#39;m speaking like an adult i&#39;m freaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">out inside whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.240" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">like then you&#39;re just schisming yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">and so i want to see people showing up</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">as an adult</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:04.720" style="s2">and that means i want to see them seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">where they aren&#39;t and doing what it</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.720" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">takes to actually get there rather than</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">pretend</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">and where they aren&#39;t there i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:12.319" style="s2">them to have shame about it but i also</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">don&#39;t want them acting on the world from</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.319" end="01:07:14.799" style="s2">that place i want them acting on</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.799" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">and then i want them acting on the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">when they&#39;re in the right place to act</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.440" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">on the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">i want us supporting each other in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">if you see somebody</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">sharing information and trying to act on</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">the world from a place that doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">actually clear that might be propagating</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">then lovingly try to support them to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">recenter</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.119" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">neither add to it nor attack them</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">because that&#39;s not going to help</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">right just try to lovingly help them</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">recenter and be open to when others do</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">that with you</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:52.240" style="s2">in fact ask for it seeking the counsel</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.720" style="s2">of people who</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.240" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">you consider wise counsel is a sign of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.720" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">wisdom itself</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">um now with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:08.079" style="s2">traumas coming up to heal right now yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">and this is another thing so i want</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.079" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">people to show up as adults and that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">takes whatever it takes</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">right so people if people are at home</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">and they have extra free time maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">is the time they can be doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:19.839" style="s2">skype therapy sessions and they can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">reading the things and doing the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">meditation and doing the journaling that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">they&#39;ve wanted to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">that&#39;d be great we it&#39;s either a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">solitary confinement or an ostrom</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:32.319" style="s2">right like it can be this great mental</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">health crisis where</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.319" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">we get a huge amount of benzo addictions</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">that just ruin everything</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">for a long time or a</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">uh emergence into people going</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">deeper into their own wholeness together</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">and with each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">uh now we want to work on which of those</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">it is for ourself</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:53.199" style="s2">and with our communities and with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">world as best we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.199" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">the same with the educational crisis</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">this can be the generation of kids that</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">all got no education for some time and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">had upset parents traumatizing the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">out of them</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">at in a small place or where we actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">reinvent schooling in a much better way</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">in education because we need to so</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">in all these ways the same with health</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:16.239" style="s2">care the same with the food security</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">system the same with our risk prevention</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.239" end="01:09:19.440" style="s2">system the same with</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">macroeconomics it can either get much</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.440" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">or we can use this catalyst to make</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">things much better to be able to do the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">larger macro things we have to be in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">right place to be capacitated to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">so we work on that first and then the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:34.400" style="s2">other and it&#39;s somewhat you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">ongoingly back and forth as needed</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:37.679" style="s2">in addition to i would like people to</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">show up as adults where it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.679" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">possible being able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">show up in a way that is calm</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">and clear and grounded and not biasing</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">towards seeing things</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">as better or worse than they are but</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:55.120" style="s2">very clearly and then biasing towards</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">how to make things better effectively</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.120" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">the people who can do that are the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">people who will lead the solutions and</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">other people will look to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.440" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">but you can&#39;t pretend you&#39;ve got to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:06.640" style="s2">what it takes to actually have that</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:09.760" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.640" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">and this image of the coal pressurizes</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.760" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">into diamonds by</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:14.159" style="s2">pressure by intensive pressure right or</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:24.480" style="s2">so as there&#39;s increased pressure we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">either have it</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.480" end="01:10:29.679" style="s2">fracture us or turn the coal into</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:32.560" style="s2">diamond where we become clearer and more</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.679" end="01:10:33.760" style="s2">crystalline and precise and and to have</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.560" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">that as a frame</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.760" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">that as the pressure gets more i</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">actually go slower</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">clearer more grounded just even as an</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">can be helpful</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really beautiful um</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">yeah i forget his name bio i think it</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">depends his last name he says that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">times are urgent slow down</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">really important and counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">you know um i think yeah just overall</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:14.000" style="s2">kind of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">this appetite for bias and really</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.000" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">understanding it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">yeah a powerful outcome of this time as</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:24.840" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2">trying to ground in the healthiest way</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.840" end="01:11:28.960" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.400" end="01:11:29.679" style="s2">u.s special forces has this uh statement</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.960" end="01:11:30.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.679" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of versions of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.880" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">perennially but</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">slow is smooth and smooth is fast</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s not saying go slow when urgent</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">action is needed it&#39;s saying go</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">fast but mistakes aren&#39;t fast mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">end up being super super slow doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">doing like you&#39;re trying to clean the</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:50.159" style="s2">kitchen so fast before guests come and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">you break glasses and now you gotta</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.159" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:50.640" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">take the time to clean it up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">way slower than had you moved a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">bit slower</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">so you don&#39;t want to break right</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to spread misinformation</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to act on this</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">so you got to go slow enough to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">smooth where each step is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:05.679" style="s2">right step and gets to build on right</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">steps</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.679" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">which is actually the very fastest thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:10.400" style="s2">you can possibly do</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">so i&#39;m actually encouraging people to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.400" end="01:12:16.880" style="s2">fast but actually fast</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:20.159" style="s2">which means clear smooth</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.880" end="01:12:20.159" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.840" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.840" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">wonderful we&#39;re we&#39;re approaching the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.400" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">end of our time here</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:34.640" style="s2">i feel um we covered a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">of principles and and biases and</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.640" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">just a lot of insight is there anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:39.840" style="s2">else you would offer one thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:41.920" style="s2">asking people is are there any</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.840" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">vocabulary terms that people can</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.920" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">insert into their</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">you know daily or weekly use that would</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">enable them to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">kind of upgrade their their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">there&#39;s certain things that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:03.040" style="s2">unfortunately though this is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:05.199" style="s2">absolutely the case the community of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.040" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">practice that in general looks at</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.199" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">critical thinking and logical fallacies</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re the ones that look at bias</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.719" end="01:13:14.480" style="s2">the most or very very frequently in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">terms of cognitive bias</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.480" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">that whole field in my opinion admits a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">certain bias</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:23.679" style="s2">which is kind of funny which is that it</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.679" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">biasing towards analysis over synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:32.080" style="s2">so it wants to make sure that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:34.480" style="s2">having any wrong ideas and it rejects</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.080" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">wrong ideas but it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.480" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">making sure that the very</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:38.880" style="s2">partial reductionist ideas are being put</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:41.199" style="s2">together in</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.880" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">good overarching frameworks which is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.199" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">synthesis side</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">so it there is a need for synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">thought and creative thought</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">as well as very analytic thought and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.520" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.159" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">the tools of critical thinking generally</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:58.560" style="s2">help you with the analytic thought more</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">and so those are necessary but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.560" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">not sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">and there are places where they&#39;re rules</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">of thumb that are not true they&#39;re rules</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">of thumb</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">so like the uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">occam&#39;s razor right sometimes the thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">that is true actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:16.640" style="s2">is more complicated than you know the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">hypothesis than something else</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.640" end="01:14:20.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a general kind of razor</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">just for those who don&#39;t know is like</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.719" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">the simplest solution to something with</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">the less variables is</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.480" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">more likely to be true yeah and and we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">might say that statistically that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">often the case but it also even depends</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.600" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">upon the scenario like</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">the simple economic models are always</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.040" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">really wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:42.560" style="s2">and the simple biological models are</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:44.159" style="s2">always really wrong because the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.560" end="01:14:46.480" style="s2">causation is actually complex so</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">really depends on the domain so uh in</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.480" end="01:14:51.120" style="s2">terms of terms</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:53.520" style="s2">i think people just going and looking up</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.120" end="01:14:55.360" style="s2">epistemology and reading the wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.520" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">page or the oxford philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.360" end="01:14:59.280" style="s2">page and just kind of having a basic</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:02.239" style="s2">sense is good</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:02.239" style="s2">uh looking up</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:05.679" style="s2">and then if you want to do the wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:08.000" style="s2">rabbit hole thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.679" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">so it&#39;ll if it mentions bayesian</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.000" end="01:15:10.159" style="s2">analysis take it take a little trip down</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:11.679" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.159" end="01:15:14.159" style="s2">and maybe go watch a couple youtube</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.679" end="01:15:15.199" style="s2">videos on bayesian analysis and on</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.159" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">network theory on</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.199" end="01:15:18.320" style="s2">graph theory on statistics on learning</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:20.560" style="s2">basics</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.320" end="01:15:22.159" style="s2">things about statistics on as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.560" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">hearing the terms epidemiology and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.159" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">virology and immunology so much maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:27.760" style="s2">just read the wikipedia page to start</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:29.040" style="s2">like do i know what a virus is do i</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.760" end="01:15:30.800" style="s2">actually know what rna is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:31.679" style="s2">difference between rna and dna do i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.800" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">hearing pcr</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.679" end="01:15:35.360" style="s2">and serological and immunological do i</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">know what the words mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.360" end="01:15:39.600" style="s2">how about i just look up the words that</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:43.600" style="s2">i&#39;m hearing especially before i use them</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.600" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">yeah um that and i don&#39;t have to read a</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">textbook let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:47.360" style="s2">read a wikipedia page to at least have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">beginning sentence which will actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.360" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:50.640" style="s2">humble you because you&#39;ll realize that</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:52.239" style="s2">there was much more that you didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.640" end="01:15:54.400" style="s2">know that you didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.239" end="01:15:56.080" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll probably as you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.400" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">more actually be more humble in your</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.080" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">presentation than</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:00.719" style="s2">you knew less and just repeated a word</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.719" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">okay in terms of words i would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:07.120" style="s2">every word that you&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:08.640" style="s2">it seems important that you&#39;re tempted</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.640" end="01:16:16.080" style="s2">look it up first yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">awesome yeah and kind of we ask every</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.080" end="01:16:18.880" style="s2">i guess lecturer to come up with an</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">activity i feel like that could be a</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.880" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">good one is</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.760" end="01:16:24.239" style="s2">starting with epistemol uh epistemology</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:05.520" style="s2">very easy to have rational arguments</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.560" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">that are gibberish because they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.520" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">wrong axioms or missing something</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s entirely possible that you read</p>

<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:17.520" style="s2">that makes sense to you because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:18:17.520" end="01:18:25.040" style="s2">and it makes sense everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">that the virus has been bad their 5g was</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.040" end="01:18:28.080" style="s2">recently installed</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:29.360" style="s2">and everywhere there&#39;s 5g the virus is</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.080" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">bad oh and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.360" end="01:18:36.880" style="s2">5g just got pushed through oh</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.120" end="01:18:40.159" style="s2">well go fact check that first just</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.880" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">look at a map of all the places that 5g</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:43.679" style="s2">is and then look at a place a map of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:46.880" style="s2">places that</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.679" end="01:18:48.560" style="s2">the virus is and see if the claim made</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.880" end="01:18:52.400" style="s2">is true before you share it</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.560" end="01:18:52.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s not in that particular case</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.840" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">and so just because something</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:01.440" style="s2">sounds compelling and it seems maybe</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">plausible upon first blush</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.440" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.560" end="01:19:10.880" style="s2">but if you put it out even if you say</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.320" end="01:19:12.080" style="s2">what do you guys think of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.880" end="01:19:13.760" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t want to do the hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">work of making sense of it lots of other</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.760" end="01:19:15.760" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want to do the hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">work of making sense of it will be</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.760" end="01:19:18.239" style="s2">compelled the way that you were and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:19.280" style="s2">starts to affect background thought</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.239" end="01:19:20.480" style="s2">you&#39;re actually polluting the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.280" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">information ecology you&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.480" end="01:19:23.920" style="s2">styrofoam</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:25.440" style="s2">your intellectual styrofoam into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.920" end="01:19:28.719" style="s2">ocean right</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.440" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">and so just don&#39;t do that um</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.719" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">and at least do enough research to see</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:34.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s if something is</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.960" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">probably not grounded and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.480" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to go further</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:39.120" style="s2">then do an adequate preface i looked</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">into this here&#39;s what i could find</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.120" end="01:19:41.600" style="s2">here&#39;s what i couldn&#39;t find i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:43.440" style="s2">trying to figure this out does anyone</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">have good data on such and such</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.440" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">and then tag the people that you think</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">are probably the people who might be</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">able to figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:50.960" style="s2">right start smaller instead of polluting</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:54.400" style="s2">a whole</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.960" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">wider landscape yeah yeah i think that</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.400" end="01:19:58.880" style="s2">makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:20:00.159" style="s2">and just like i think people yeah going</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.880" end="01:20:02.320" style="s2">to like primary source</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.159" end="01:20:04.719" style="s2">you know just being having an appetite</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.320" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">for doing our own research</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.719" end="01:20:08.800" style="s2">i think so many people have become</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:09.920" style="s2">accustomed to just getting information</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.800" end="01:20:11.920" style="s2">from other people who&#39;ve already done</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.920" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">the synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.920" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">and kind of going back to a couple</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.440" end="01:20:17.120" style="s2">points ago you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.120" end="01:20:22.239" style="s2">analysis oriented tools</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.880" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">and not as many synthesis um</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.239" end="01:20:27.840" style="s2">tools or rules of thumb or or</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.280" end="01:20:31.120" style="s2">yeah work in that realm how can people</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.840" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">kind of balance that out for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.120" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">so this thing that is often attributed</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">and quoted to einstein talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">imagination being as important or more</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:42.639" style="s2">important than intellect and</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:46.800" style="s2">creativity and those types of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.639" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">or intuition right</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.800" end="01:20:50.880" style="s2">so there was this process that einstein</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.880" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">where he would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:57.360" style="s2">working on the math on the chalkboard or</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:20:59.280" style="s2">on the paper</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">until he hit a diminishing return and he</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.280" end="01:21:02.880" style="s2">just wasn&#39;t making progress</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">and then he would take a break and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.880" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">go puff his</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">pipe and look at the clouds and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:10.719" style="s2">zone out</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:12.000" style="s2">or play his violin kind of zone out</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.719" end="01:21:14.159" style="s2">and then at a certain point in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:15.760" style="s2">zoning out and i deal with pop</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.159" end="01:21:19.360" style="s2">and then you go back with that idea to</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.760" end="01:21:19.360" style="s2">the white board and work on it</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.080" end="01:21:26.320" style="s2">so now i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.199" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">say a metaphor for what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.320" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">neurologically that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.840" end="01:21:32.239" style="s2">is actually how neurology works but and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">so i&#39;m specifying</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.239" end="01:21:36.320" style="s2">that this is not a absolute mechanistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:39.440" style="s2">statement it&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.320" end="01:21:42.560" style="s2">so that there is this</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:45.840" style="s2">kind of left hemispheric</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.560" end="01:21:46.960" style="s2">more serial more analytic process</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.840" end="01:21:49.920" style="s2">and then there is a more right</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.960" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">hemispheric more parallel</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.920" end="01:21:54.960" style="s2">more synthetic process and</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:57.040" style="s2">the corpus callosum has a largely</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.960" end="01:21:58.639" style="s2">inhibitory or shunting process between</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.040" end="01:21:59.920" style="s2">those and that the analytic process</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.639" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">actually has to shut off for a little</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.920" end="01:22:04.320" style="s2">while for the synthetic process</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:06.080" style="s2">so the analytic is this axioms these</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.320" end="01:22:08.400" style="s2">data these logical transforms this</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.080" end="01:22:10.639" style="s2">because this because this therefore this</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:12.320" style="s2">syllogistically right and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.639" end="01:22:13.760" style="s2">is a pattern analysis of look for</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.320" end="01:22:16.159" style="s2">everything like this</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.760" end="01:22:17.280" style="s2">and then uh aha that seems to come out</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.159" end="01:22:18.320" style="s2">of nowhere we might think of his</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.280" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">intuition but it didn&#39;t come out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.320" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">nowhere it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.600" end="01:22:22.800" style="s2">that process doesn&#39;t happen consciously</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">in the same way because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.800" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:29.199" style="s2">bandwidth of the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:30.880" style="s2">and that that then can give a new</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.199" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">insight but we don&#39;t take it as absolute</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.880" end="01:22:34.000" style="s2">truth we then have to plug it back into</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.560" end="01:22:35.440" style="s2">the other process and see how it works</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.000" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">but then once you hit diminishing return</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:40.159" style="s2">there go back to this one</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:42.000" style="s2">and i think it was wigner might have</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.159" end="01:22:44.400" style="s2">been teller but i think it was wigner</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.000" end="01:22:46.080" style="s2">who about the physicist the great</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.400" end="01:22:47.199" style="s2">physicist who developed modern physics</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.080" end="01:22:50.639" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.199" end="01:22:52.880" style="s2">we all knew that in terms of raw</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.639" end="01:22:54.639" style="s2">horsepower von neumann was the smartest</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.880" end="01:22:56.080" style="s2">like he could just figure out he</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.639" end="01:22:57.280" style="s2">could do the math faster than any of us</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">it was obvious</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.280" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">but for all of his cleverness</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.320" end="01:23:03.440" style="s2">einstein still was the one with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:06.320" style="s2">deepest insights</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.440" end="01:23:07.760" style="s2">and some reason for that it wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.320" end="01:23:11.440" style="s2">straight clock speed</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.760" end="01:23:14.880" style="s2">it was something else right um</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.440" end="01:23:18.960" style="s2">so i would say there is the study</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.880" end="01:23:22.080" style="s2">read fact check and then also</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.960" end="01:23:23.520" style="s2">go let yourself have that in mind don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.080" end="01:23:24.719" style="s2">distract onto the laundry list or</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.520" end="01:23:27.199" style="s2">whatever and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.719" end="01:23:28.960" style="s2">meditate look at the clouds zone out and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.199" end="01:23:30.639" style="s2">then see what ideas come and journal</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.960" end="01:23:32.320" style="s2">those down and then go back</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.639" end="01:23:35.120" style="s2">right let yourself kind of have both of</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.320" end="01:23:38.880" style="s2">those processes</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">and then find the facts as best you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.880" end="01:23:43.760" style="s2">and then also step back and consciously</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:47.199" style="s2">try to put them together</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.760" end="01:23:49.199" style="s2">what kind of overarching picture</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.199" end="01:23:50.480" style="s2">or narratives or whatever might make</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.199" end="01:23:51.679" style="s2">sense but be careful because it might</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.480" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">not be a simple narrative it might be</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.679" end="01:23:56.480" style="s2">lots of overlapping ones</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.199" end="01:23:58.880" style="s2">right but try to see would this</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.480" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">overarching kind of frame make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.880" end="01:24:02.639" style="s2">lots of these</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">and then say well if that was if this</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.639" end="01:24:06.000" style="s2">narrative was true</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.840" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">what else would be true and go look to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.000" end="01:24:09.440" style="s2">see is that there or not what would</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:11.920" style="s2">falsify or verify</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:14.880" style="s2">this narrative or this hypothesis or</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.920" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">kind of overarching structural frame</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.880" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.639" end="01:24:22.400" style="s2">so yeah those are some things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.840" end="01:24:24.880" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.400" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">it&#39;s really helpful what other offerings</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.880" end="01:24:29.040" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:31.840" style="s2">ways can people continue to engage with</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.040" end="01:24:33.199" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.840" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">i think you shared these there are these</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.199" end="01:24:37.440" style="s2">couple videos we did with rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">they called them the war on sense making</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.440" end="01:24:42.639" style="s2">uh it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">basically we&#39;re here we&#39;re sharing tools</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.639" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">of sense making there we were more</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:47.520" style="s2">sharing tools of propaganda that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:48.960" style="s2">commonly used in the media landscape</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">that mess up your sense making to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.960" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">able to recognize them so you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">wrongly affected by them</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:56.080" style="s2">the intention of those videos was to</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.360" end="01:24:59.120" style="s2">kind of inoculate people against</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.080" end="01:25:02.639" style="s2">um bad sense making those are worth</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.120" end="01:25:05.440" style="s2">checking out and uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.639" end="01:25:06.239" style="s2">then if if you want follow me on</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.440" end="01:25:09.120" style="s2">facebook</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.239" end="01:25:11.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t post public stuff very often but</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.120" end="01:25:15.440" style="s2">i if i do i post it there</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.440" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">and uh podcasts and other stuff some of</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.440" end="01:25:19.280" style="s2">it historically</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:19.920" style="s2">is on uh civilizationemerging.com but</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.280" end="01:25:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.920" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">not very updated um</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">facebook&#39;s probably the best place</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.480" end="01:25:34.960" style="s2">i find that the the earnestness and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.159" end="01:25:34.960" style="s2">curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.960" end="01:25:40.480" style="s2">comes from something that you could</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.719" end="01:25:42.880" style="s2">think of as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.480" end="01:25:45.280" style="s2">spiritual impulse there is like actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.880" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">a reverence for reality that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.280" end="01:25:50.960" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">there is a respect for and uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.960" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a respect for the integrity</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:57.440" style="s2">of reality and a reverence that wants</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:25:59.679" style="s2">to and it&#39;s almost like if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.440" end="01:26:00.320" style="s2">lover and you really want to love them</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.679" end="01:26:02.560" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.320" end="01:26:03.840" style="s2">you want to know their childhood stories</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.560" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">and what they love in their favorite</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.840" end="01:26:07.040" style="s2">color flower and their favorite</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:08.800" style="s2">songs and whatever so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.040" end="01:26:10.000" style="s2">actually love them well and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.800" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">mean that you&#39;ll ever fully know them</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.000" end="01:26:13.600" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t ever think that but</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:15.679" style="s2">that you want to know them better as an</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.600" end="01:26:18.639" style="s2">expression of the love that&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.679" end="01:26:19.840" style="s2">so and that&#39;s not the only thing you</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.639" end="01:26:22.239" style="s2">want you don&#39;t just want to know them</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.840" end="01:26:23.600" style="s2">you also want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.239" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">have union with them you also want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:26.639" style="s2">serve them right well the same is true</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:28.639" style="s2">with reality writ large</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.639" end="01:26:29.760" style="s2">where you want to seek to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.639" end="01:26:31.920" style="s2">not that you will ever understand it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.760" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">completely but the desire to understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.920" end="01:26:35.360" style="s2">more as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:37.600" style="s2">cognitive or intellectual closeness or</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.360" end="01:26:39.600" style="s2">intimacy with reality it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.600" end="01:26:40.960" style="s2">sign of a certain respect and reverence</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:43.679" style="s2">and love</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.960" end="01:26:44.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s something just profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.679" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.560" end="01:26:49.440" style="s2">in that and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:51.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s where it&#39;s motivated by what</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.440" end="01:26:51.920" style="s2">you just call pure desire to know or</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.440" end="01:26:53.840" style="s2">pure</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.920" end="01:26:55.840" style="s2">learning but where it&#39;s motivated by the</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.840" end="01:26:56.080" style="s2">desire to make a difference in the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.840" end="01:26:57.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.080" end="01:26:59.040" style="s2">i would like these people not to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.520" end="01:27:00.239" style="s2">dying i&#39;d like to have a solution that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.040" end="01:27:01.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t create an authoritarian state</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.239" end="01:27:03.920" style="s2">because i care about freedoms</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.600" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">that then also is i want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.920" end="01:27:09.040" style="s2">reality enough to be effective</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:10.719" style="s2">motivated by my love for people for</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.040" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">nature for reality and my desire to</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.719" end="01:27:14.960" style="s2">serve so the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.239" end="01:27:17.120" style="s2">where the energy to do the work comes</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.960" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">from is actually love</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.120" end="01:27:21.360" style="s2">and the deep the more you deepen your</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:23.040" style="s2">love and care the more energy you will</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.360" end="01:27:24.400" style="s2">have to do the work that it takes to</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.040" end="01:27:27.120" style="s2">have that love and care be</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.400" end="01:27:27.679" style="s2">active and manifest in serving that</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.120" end="01:27:30.560" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.679" end="01:27:30.560" style="s2">loved and cared about</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.960" end="01:27:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful thank you</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.159" end="01:27:38.560" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;ve been talking with a couple</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.880" end="01:27:42.080" style="s2">people lately of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.560" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">what is the the contagion of love</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.080" end="01:27:46.480" style="s2">you know that we can kind of match this</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:49.520" style="s2">moment with as</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.480" end="01:27:52.080" style="s2">so many are feeling so much fear um</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.520" end="01:27:53.120" style="s2">and i love yeah the the idea that that</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.080" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">love can</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.120" end="01:27:59.040" style="s2">get reverenced and we get you know more</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.440" end="01:28:03.520" style="s2">and more understanding and curiosity and</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.040" end="01:28:05.440" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of an antidote</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.520" end="01:28:06.880" style="s2">to kind of like the fear and shutdown</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.440" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">that a lot of people are in right now</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.880" end="01:28:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:16.560" style="s2">a love and yeah the curiosity and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.360" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">invitational tone of this all uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.560" end="01:28:20.239" style="s2">is a really lovely antibody sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.239" end="01:28:22.880" style="s2">moment there there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.239" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">thing i&#39;d like to offer here so</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.880" end="01:28:24.880" style="s2">something a</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:29.520" style="s2">good philosopher friend of mine shared</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.880" end="01:28:32.960" style="s2">with me that was very profound is um</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.520" end="01:28:37.920" style="s2">fear is not the opposite of love</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.960" end="01:28:41.280" style="s2">fear is a reaction to love</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.920" end="01:28:43.440" style="s2">it is sourced in it i can only be afraid</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.280" end="01:28:46.560" style="s2">of something being harmed that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.440" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">want to have be harmed that i care about</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.560" end="01:28:52.000" style="s2">and so when people are totally apathetic</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">ready to commit suicide don&#39;t feel fear</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.000" end="01:28:54.880" style="s2">around dying don&#39;t feel fear around</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:28:56.719" style="s2">hurting other people whatever</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.880" end="01:28:58.800" style="s2">because there is no love or care that is</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.719" end="01:29:01.840" style="s2">binding them still</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.800" end="01:29:03.600" style="s2">if i and let&#39;s say i i don&#39;t feel any</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.840" end="01:29:04.880" style="s2">fear over something being destroyed i</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.600" end="01:29:07.040" style="s2">don&#39;t care about them like it let</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.880" end="01:29:10.639" style="s2">it burn down</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.040" end="01:29:12.320" style="s2">so the fear is a response to</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.639" end="01:29:13.920" style="s2">something i love and care about where</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.320" end="01:29:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about it getting harmed in</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.920" end="01:29:16.960" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.280" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid of going crazy i it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.960" end="01:29:22.320" style="s2">i actually love</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:24.159" style="s2">life and my own ability to be sane and</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.320" end="01:29:24.800" style="s2">to connect and contribute and to take</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.159" end="01:29:27.199" style="s2">care of my</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.800" end="01:29:28.560" style="s2">family and to experience whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.199" end="01:29:31.840" style="s2">right like there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.560" end="01:29:34.880" style="s2">value a reverence on that</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.840" end="01:29:36.400" style="s2">now the fear might be a unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.880" end="01:29:37.840" style="s2">response i&#39;m not consciously saying i</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.400" end="01:29:39.280" style="s2">would like to get afraid now so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.840" end="01:29:41.520" style="s2">unconscious response and it might be a</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.280" end="01:29:42.320" style="s2">disempowered or disempowering response</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.520" end="01:29:44.480" style="s2">but it still</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.320" end="01:29:46.960" style="s2">derives its energy from the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.480" end="01:29:49.199" style="s2">what is cared about</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.960" end="01:29:51.120" style="s2">so i can do a conscious and empowering</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.199" end="01:29:52.000" style="s2">response instead where i say oh i care</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.120" end="01:29:53.920" style="s2">about this thing so</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.000" end="01:29:55.840" style="s2">instead of focusing on automatically</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.920" end="01:29:57.199" style="s2">unconsciously what the bad outcome is</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.840" end="01:29:58.719" style="s2">going to be and feeling like i can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.199" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">anything so i just get afraid</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.719" end="01:30:02.080" style="s2">what is the good outcome i would like</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:04.639" style="s2">and what can i do about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.080" end="01:30:06.080" style="s2">so i get empowered in that so i move the</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.639" end="01:30:09.199" style="s2">fearful to careful</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.080" end="01:30:12.000" style="s2">full of care right and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.199" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">act from there anger also comes from</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.000" end="01:30:16.159" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">sadness also does the apathy would just</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.159" end="01:30:20.480" style="s2">be like it</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.440" end="01:30:21.840" style="s2">i&#39;m not angry not and so they might all</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.480" end="01:30:23.679" style="s2">be unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.840" end="01:30:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not choosing to feel that they might</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.679" end="01:30:27.199" style="s2">all be</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.040" end="01:30:29.040" style="s2">disempowering or empowering but you can</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.199" end="01:30:30.880" style="s2">find conscious and empowering where the</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.040" end="01:30:33.040" style="s2">anger becomes more like passion</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.880" end="01:30:34.800" style="s2">and the sadness becomes more like depth</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:35.840" style="s2">of appreciation and gratitude and fear</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.800" end="01:30:39.520" style="s2">becomes more like</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.840" end="01:30:41.840" style="s2">carefulness and proactivity</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.520" end="01:30:42.960" style="s2">but any of those emotions don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.840" end="01:30:44.800" style="s2">them as bad</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.960" end="01:30:46.560" style="s2">think of them as signals of something</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.800" end="01:30:48.400" style="s2">that is cared about</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.560" end="01:30:50.000" style="s2">and then trace it back to what is it</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.400" end="01:30:51.280" style="s2">that i actually love and care about</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:52.960" style="s2">and then what is it that i want to have</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.280" end="01:30:55.840" style="s2">happen and how can i actually be</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.960" end="01:30:55.840" style="s2">empowered towards it</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.920" end="01:31:00.159" style="s2">beautiful yeah i had a realization a</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.400" end="01:31:02.560" style="s2">couple of months ago of</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.159" end="01:31:03.679" style="s2">instead of washing away fear seeing i</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.560" end="01:31:06.000" style="s2">was sitting on</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.679" end="01:31:06.800" style="s2">the side of a river um seeing it as a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.000" end="01:31:08.480" style="s2">stepping stone</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.800" end="01:31:10.159" style="s2">and the other side of the river being</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.480" end="01:31:12.639" style="s2">bravery</p>
