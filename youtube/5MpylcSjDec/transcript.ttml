<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">the first part of this series</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">you can find it on the stoa youtube</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">and how this is going to work is as</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">i think he has something prepared about</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">the canvas framework</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:14.320" style="s2">and then he&#39;s i&#39;m going to hand it over</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">to him and we can post our questions in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.320" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">the chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">if you have any questions post them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">the chat if you&#39;d like me to read the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">um indicate that when you post questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">and uh without further ado i&#39;ll hand it</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">over to dave dave</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">okay i need to um check something</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">upfront how familiar are people with</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">the canadian framework i am i giving an</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">advanced presentation or am i giving a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.439" style="s2">introduction from scratch so if</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re not familiar would you just</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">wave your hands around so i know how</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">many there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">okay right now because i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">what i want to try and get them today</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.960" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">and i may only do one of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">um is two basic sense making frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">um the one which is almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">gonna get shifted to next</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">time unless i go really quickly is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">called apex predator theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">which is a new context-based approach to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">understanding when</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">you can change things and when you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.599" style="s2">change things</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">i there there isn&#39;t a universal on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.599" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">if i don&#39;t do it today i&#39;ll do it next</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">yeah um but i want to focus for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">moment on connecting and i want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">really in two sections one is a summary</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">of what canadian is about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">but then i want to develop the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">material which is going to be published</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">shortly in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">european union handbook on how to manage</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">which is actually specifically using</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">kinevin in the context of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">management</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">yeah and that actually has five separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">turns or processes you go through so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic idea um i know when i</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">share the screens i&#39;m going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">use a picture and i can&#39;t draw which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">deeply frustrating i hate slides</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">but uh i know when i share the screen i</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to see the chat</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna try and sort of flip</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">between the two a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">um as we actually go on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">okay so i&#39;ll start off with general and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">then i&#39;ll flip to slides</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">uh kinevin is a is a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">framework it&#39;s its origins</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">are in physics chemistry biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s not a social construct you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">remember from last time i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">the basic process we&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">which is to reject the idea of creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">frameworks from case studies</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">and instead take an approach which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">interacts what we know from natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">science with practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">and uses natural science as a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">so what we actually see in nature is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">three fundamental types of system</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">ordered systems complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">chaotic systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">now i just want to be very clear now</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">this is an emerging field</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">people use language in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">yeah i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">i tend to get hung up on is it really</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">chaotic or do you mean random i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">to define my terms as i go</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">yeah and the basic definition i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">for this</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">comes from alicia gerardo and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t read the dynamics in action you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">should read it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">another new book coming out thank god at</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">next year i think yeah which is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">constraint based definition</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">so we have ordered systems complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">systems chaotic systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">they&#39;re defined by constraints so in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">ordered system the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">are so high that all behavior can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">determined</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">forecast and predicted so i&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">high level of constraint i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">predictability</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a linear material relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">between cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">and i&#39;m using that in the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually very valuable it exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">in a lot of human systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">you know it is kind of like good news um</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">but then we get into the other types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">systems so undefined is a chaotic system</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">as one which has no material</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">relationship between cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.880" style="s2">or no effective relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">i there are no effective constraints in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">which is kind of like a quasi-random</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">state everything is without connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">now what that actually means is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">always a temporary state</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">um as axelrod famously said you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">order comes for free human</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">beings don&#39;t like chaos yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of like you know somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">would impose constraints pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">fast or somebody will create constraints</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">and part of the problem with a chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">environment is you may not realize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">chaos and somebody else may</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">impose the constraints and it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">for you to actually recover</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m using chaos in that sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">word other people will actually use it</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">chaos is an unconstrained state or no</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">effective constraints</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">which means it&#39;s always a temporary</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">space it&#39;s not a permanent space</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">and then we get complete a complex space</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">and in a complex space</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">um everything is entangled</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">concept of entanglement is key</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">and everything is constrained in all</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">sorts of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">we we normally talk about enabling</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">constraints here</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">so the connections matter more than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">things something which i&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">in the final lecture when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">organizational change</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">um trying to change people actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">won&#39;t work and it&#39;s not ethical</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">yet trying to change how they connect on</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">the other hand is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">more effective and i think can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">ethical right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">the connectivity is the key thing in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">complex adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">and the whole point about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">entanglement and the connections is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">fully know what they are you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">bramble bush bushes in a thicket</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">metaphor from last time is key um</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">you know if i pull one bramble i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">know what the impact will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">all sorts of things can can do that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">happens at the basic level i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">happily engaged in um dealing with wet</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">rot and dry rotting garden furniture</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">this afternoon which involves stringing</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">electrical cables the length of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">garden</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">and shall we just say there was a degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">of entanglement both with the electrical</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">cables and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">also with my language all right as we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">went through that process</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">so entanglement happens actually very</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">very quickly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">um so those are three basic types of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">um and there are phase shifts between</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s actually important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">understand if you want a metaphor in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">this think about solid liquid and gas</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">and if you remember from high school you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">remember latent heat</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">so you take water to 100 degrees it</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t become steam you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">more heat in</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">yet before it becomes steam and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">phase transition or a phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">kind of like the mathematics on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">backs me up and so no mark i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">it as a diode i see it as three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">yeah um ordered systems complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">chaotic systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">there&#39;s an energy gradient between them</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">understand so there&#39;s a hidden energy</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">cost of transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">and also it works the other way i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">my children always laugh at me because</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll come in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">you know february or march and say i can</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">smell snow coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">i grew up in the country i can smell</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">snow</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">they come we&#39;re losing a lot of skills</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">right um the reason i can do that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">that in order for</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">liquid to become solid heat has to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">thrown out</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">so it always warms up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">before snow comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">and that actually creates a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">olifactory stimulus which actually means</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">that if you grow up in your family and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">you recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">you can sort of smell snow coming but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">energy is given out or energy is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">in the process of phase transition and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">triggering a phase transition can</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">actually therefore release energy</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">as well as requiring it so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">kind like basic three</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">and you can actually draw kinevin as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">flat plane</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">brasso and i did this at the academy of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">management years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">in which the boundary between chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">order is shown as a catastrophic fold</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">now that&#39;s going back to renee tom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">so basically if you can imagine a flat</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">plane of paper and you fold the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">bit over so it looks like a wave</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the boundary between order and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">chaos and the danger is you don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">the cliff until you fall off it so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a basic principle here</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">yeah in terms of the phase transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">between order and chaos is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">catastrophic transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">in in the way it works right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the the straw that breaks the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">camel&#39;s back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">and so on and so forth so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">highly ordered system you&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">there&#39;s constraints and actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">constraint is not sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">everything may seem perfectly normal to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">you but then one day you wake up and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">you&#39;ve fallen off a cliff yet everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">has changed</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">so that that that&#39;s shown as a fold so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">at its simplest level canaverin can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">shown</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">as a flat plane with a catastrophic fold</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">with those three types of systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.399" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">we move on from that because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">just concerned with the ontology of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">we&#39;re also concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">epistemology and the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">yeah now in human beings that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">important because the three are separate</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">i mean they&#39;re obviously interlinked</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">what things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">how we know about things and how we</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:13.920" style="s2">perceive things are three separate</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">separate aspects and by the way i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.920" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">severely anti-social constructivism so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">if we want to have an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">that later</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s fine you know kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">reality exists live with it is my</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">general response to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">um but the fact is that human perception</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">can differ from</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">human knowledge can differ from reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">and part of the use of kinevin is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">increase the friction between those</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">three i&#39;ll talk more about that in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">final election</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">if you can increase the friction between</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">the three you present the huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">misalignments which actually happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">i used to give the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">catholic church&#39;s misalignment with</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">science at the time of galileo</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">the more you miss a line when you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">to reset the reset is catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">but there are probably better examples</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">in the uk and the us</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">at the moment i&#39;m not quite sure who i</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">just like more</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">boris or trump but they&#39;re both trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">to out-compete each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">yeah in populist so there are other</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">examples so if you allow a system</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">to become over constrained you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">so one links can having does is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">divides and at this point i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">go into share screen</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve got to find it now</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">okay so assuming everybody can see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the thing i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">last week that&#39;s the sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">making diagram and the different types</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">and i can send the reference to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">but coming back to kinevin can having</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">effectively has</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">five domains um</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have five quadrants i worry</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">about people who think they can be five</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">it&#39;s rather like a former prime minister</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">in britain who said he wanted all</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">schools to be above average</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">yeah which rather showed that his wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">he even though it was eaten</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">so canarian had actually five domains</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">the chaotic and complex we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">about but what kinevin does</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">is it splits order into two</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">one where the relationship between cause</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">and effect is clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">and the other where it&#39;s complicated now</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">the division here is an important one</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">in the clear domain the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">between cause and effect is self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">everybody buys into it it&#39;s not disputed</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">yeah which means we can all do things</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">the same way the example i normally give</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">is that civilized countries drive on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">left-hand side of the road</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">whereas uncivilized countries drive on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">the right-hand side of the road</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">you know kind of like it&#39;s a simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">bifurcation where am i</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a classification system where am i</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">what type of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">country is it which side of the road i</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">should drive and then go with it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">sidebar on that by the way i mean before</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">kobe i used to drive around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole issue about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">entrainment and patterns if you hire a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">in a right-hand drive country i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">drive without worrying about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">but if i take my car into france it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">actually dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">yeah that that sort of change of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">gear stick well yeah or whatever and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">steering wheel is key but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">sidebar</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like where things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">clear um there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">obvious relationship between cause and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">effect in complicated it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">the relationship between cause and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">effect exists</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s not self-evident it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">discovered it may be self-evident to an</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">expert</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">so you either have to trust the expert</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">or you have to do analysis or you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">to do research so what we then got is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">complicated complex chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">and then the central domain of canavium</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">which we&#39;re going to come to more at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">end of this presentation</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">which used to be called a disorder and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">is now called confused</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">i mean to be honest this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">of marketing you know we&#39;ve now got</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">five c&#39;s and it&#39;s complexity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">connecting there&#39;s lots of c so i can</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">add in coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">and lots of other words complexity has a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">large sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">number of c words so basically confused</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">means i don&#39;t know which of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">and the danger with that is i will</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">actually assume</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">the system is the one i&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">so if i&#39;m a bureaucrat i&#39;ll assume that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">the problem is a failure of process</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">if i&#39;m an expert then you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">people didn&#39;t give me enough time or</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">money to investigate this properly</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">politicians are actually quite good at</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">the complex domain</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">um if they have a problem they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">solve they just pull lots of people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">with lots of different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">and listen to them all which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">quite a good strategy</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">and of course fascists love a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">because then they can be given absolute</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">control to tell everybody else what to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s an old adage in this in</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">crisis management if you have a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">crisis manager fire them</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">because they probably created the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">in the first place because they enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">managing them too much</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you don&#39;t know it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">majority of cases of arson</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">in bushfires are actually caused by</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">firefighters</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">now they actually like fires so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough naturally they&#39;ll kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">of like create them</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">so confused is about recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a state of not knowing which</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">system you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">and as you say when we come to a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">to move things from chaotic to confused</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">makes a lot of sense okay you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">stabilize things quickly</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">so that allows us to actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">each domain now with a very different</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">so in the clear domain we can have best</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">yeah the constraints are fixed there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">one right where i&#39;m doing things if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">in america i drive on the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">if i&#39;m in britain i drive on the left if</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m in southern italy it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">what side of the road i drive</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">um provided i flock it has actually been</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">studied and the way to drive south of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">naples</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">is follow the next car match speed avoid</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">collision</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">yet if you do that it&#39;s a stress-free</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">driving experience if you try and follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">the rules it won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">but in the majority of countries kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s a simple classification system</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">so i sense i categorize i respond</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s kind of like the sequence in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">the complicated domain on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">um experts know but i have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">either trust the experts or do analysis</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">so i sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">analyze respond and now the constraints</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">aren&#39;t fixed and rigid they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">governing constraints so they allow some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">degrees of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">and and that&#39;s the important concept</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">yeah kind of like in the clear space</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">everything is tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">now the coupling is becoming looser</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">um so for example uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">you can get lots of differences so one</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">of the things you find if you work with</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">doctors which i do a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">is that different surgeons will have</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">different views</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">uh when last december i was trey pan</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">which was an interesting experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">having two hulls</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">you know drilled into your skull it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">given me huge street cred with the new</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">age travelers around where i live at</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">avery but that&#39;s another matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">because it used to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">shamanistic practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">but when the surgeon discharged me he</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">said oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">you had you he said it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">the surgeon who was going to operate on</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">me wanted to put a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">tube into the head to allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">check and drain later</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">but the surgeon who did operate me on me</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">didn&#39;t do that there were different</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">and they have different reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">doing it in different practices around</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">because if you have the right expertise</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to vary the practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">and a big mistake people do is to try</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">and enforce best practice in a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">practice domain</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">okay so these that&#39;s what we mean the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">difference between fixed constraints</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">there&#39;s one way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">governing constraints provided you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">satisfy the constraint condition you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">do things in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">best practice or good practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">um in the chaotic domain i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">leave complexity for last</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re in here accidentally as</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">opposed to deliberately we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">come on to the deliberate moves in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">um then basically you&#39;ve got to act</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">decisively to destroy the chaos you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">got to create some type of constraint</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">yeah there are no effective constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">here it means that practice will always</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">be novel it&#39;s actually quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">the old adage is there&#39;s nothing so good</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">as a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">to encourage innovation because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">happened in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">is the constraints have disappeared so a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">lot of the in-train</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">patterns remember people don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">yeah in the x-rays all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">people are seeing things differently so</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">you can get novelty</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">so the model there is accents respond</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">unless you go in there deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">now in the complex domain this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">enabling constraints the way i normally</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">distinguish between governing</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">constraints and enabling constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">is think about the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">rule and a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">yeah so a rule says thou shalt yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">a heuristic says something similar but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s different the best example i know</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">is the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">marines and i&#39;ve done a lot of work done</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.080" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">at quantico</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">over the years and they have a simple</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">set of heuristics if the battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">plan breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">capture the high ground stay in touch</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:10.320" style="s2">keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">now that&#39;s called an enabling constraint</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.320" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t tell you what to do but</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">whether you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">complied with it is measurable</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve done a lot of work with</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">companies from chanel</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">to south african mining companies to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">identify the judgment heuristics which</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">are embedded in their normal stories</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">codify them and then distribute them as</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">a different control mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">because the whole point about a complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">world is you&#39;ve got inherent ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">yeah and you can&#39;t prescribe for</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">ambiguity in advance</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;ll talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">on in this series</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:49.520" style="s2">is the question about distributions and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">remember i said this last week</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.520" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">in complexity we&#39;re in the tail of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">not in the center of a normal</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">yeah which means the number of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to take into account is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">too high yeah and therefore we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">have some governing principles but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">can&#39;t pre-prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">what we should do and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">constraints come into play</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">vastly underused in management and also</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">generally in governance worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s one of the important areas yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">a lot of work on heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">uh especially linked with ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">practice here is x-active</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">now this is a phrase from biology if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">want a simple english phrase</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">as an alternative you can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">radical repurposing</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">all right so acceptation i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">my favorite two biological examples</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">feathers evolved on dinosaurs for warmth</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">or sexual display</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve now got the evidence from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">discoveries in northern china</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">which actually say that all dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">had feathers of some type</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">yeah some got lots of feathers and those</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">are the dinosaurs that fell off cliffs</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">yeah or possibly ran at speed and took</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">off and glided</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">we can see those two pathways what then</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">happens is the feathers</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">which evolved which adapted in a linear</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">for one purpose and the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">stress</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">except for something completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">now this was a key discovery in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">evolutionary biology it&#39;s attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">gold and others</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">because until we had this there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">enough time in human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">for the brain to develop the capacity it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">but to give you my other example the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">cerebellum at the base of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">which evolved in higher apes</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">to control grammar in language</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">so the huge sophistication of language</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">couldn&#39;t develop in a linear way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">too big a leap</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">it required a non-linear extaptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">yeah now actually we now know that most</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">of the human body happen accidentally</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">they evolve for one function then we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">like radically repurpose them for</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">and we do this all the time anyway i</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">have radically repurposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">many things to open beer bottles in a</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">models and then in 1945</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">a raytheon engineer maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">magneto of a radar machine</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">now he wasn&#39;t the first person to notice</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">this most people swore and got their</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">trousers cleaned</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">but he realizes the significance we get</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">yeah the magneto is repurposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">thalidomide was developed in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">pharmaceutical industry for pain relief</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">it produced two side effects one was a</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">and that happened because people noticed</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">a side effect and of course farmer has</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">the most famous one of all</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">the ability to notice something which</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">has new significance is key</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">to what we call acceptive innovation</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">rather than adaptive innovation in a</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got every opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">because you haven&#39;t got in time to</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">if you want a good example of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">remember that ibm</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">repurposed their worldwide expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">punch cards</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">to get early dominance in computing</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">generally competitive advantage comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">the person who can repurpose existing</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">for something new rather than the person</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">so acceptation is key then so that then</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">starts to make the framework more</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">but then in a key</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">where&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get the screen to change</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">but it stopped changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">until my best you guys but everything is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">frozen</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">ah started to work now</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">this is a significant addition to knavin</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">it&#39;s one more line</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll say now that my view of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">sense making frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:20.640" style="s2">is there is a basic test can you draw</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">them on the back of a table that came</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">from memory</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">if you can&#39;t do that they have no</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">utility yeah they kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">you know you see these big consultancy</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">models and dependency frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">and this came to me when i was in naples</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">my daughter looking at caravaggio&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">paintings</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">and if you know his paintings you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">they use color and tone in quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">brilliant ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:47.399" style="s2">and that was when i suddenly realized</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been looking for is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.399" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">anthropological concept of liminality</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">so liminality is a state of transition</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">or suspended transition</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">so if you go back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">anthropology when somebody puts on a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">mask</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">yeah in in a ritual they go through a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">liminal state of transition between</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">being who they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">and what the mask represents</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">now before we had liminality we had</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">arrows moving across canevin and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">actually found that people were very</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">confused by that they couldn&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">two classification systems domains and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">by adding liminality we created the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">concept of transition</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">yeah and that that was really important</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">because it changes the way people think</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">so it gives us actually four liminal</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:43.679" style="s2">one is the domain between complex and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:46.919" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">so in the complex environment many</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.919" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">are equally valid i mean you&#39;ve all been</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">there if you&#39;ve been a decision maker</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">10 or 15 people come to you they&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">got perfectly coherent ideas you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">decide who&#39;s right on the evidence base</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">yeah and you have to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">complex environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">yeah if the evidence supports</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">conflicting hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">and you can&#39;t resolve them on an</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">evidence basis within the time frame for</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">the decision making</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s complex it&#39;s a really simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">so instead of deciding what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">do is you run a safe to failed</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">experiment for each coherent hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">and you run them in parallel not in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">sequence</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">because you don&#39;t want no one want</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">what&#39;s called a hawthorn effect</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">anything novel always works the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">time for humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a real problem with government</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">initiatives kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">a prototype will always produce good</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">results but it won&#39;t necessarily scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">comes from the hawthorne experiments</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">back in the 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">if you pay attention to people and do</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">something new</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">it will nearly always work</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">and that actually is a real danger for</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">people in terms of the way we do things</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">so basically in the complex world you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">multiple parallel</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">safe to fail experiments and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">change the dynamics of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">so you can see what will work</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got it down to one or two</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">options then you move into the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">domain for anybody in agile</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">this is where things like techniques</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">like scrum come into play</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve now limited the hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">you just want to get the details right</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">you&#39;re going through iterative process</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">you&#39;re not yet firm</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to shift things into</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">because if you can shift things into</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">complicated you can scale at low cost</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">but there&#39;s quite high energy in doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">that because that&#39;s an upwards move on</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">the energy scale so that&#39;s that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">between complex and complicated and of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">course you may</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">then decide not to shift it over you may</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">want to keep your options open</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">the liminal domain with chaotic is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">something i&#39;ll deal with next week in</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">more detail</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where you actually deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">remove</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">all connectivity in order to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">novelty to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like an innovation space</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">yet you break existing constraints so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">that the constraints no longer apply</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">we also use it for distributed decision</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">support this is the wisdom of crowds</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">if i have a thousand people looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">and interpreted it in parallel without</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">any connectivity i&#39;ve actually got a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">mathematical way</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">of making decisions under conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">yeah because if i remove all connections</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">i&#39;m moving things to the center of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">whereas if i have connections things are</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">in the tales of a pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">i&#39;ll do more on that next week but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">thing the one i really love on wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">crowds is a us submarine</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">which grounded off the coast coast of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">portugal</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">it didn&#39;t sink i was corrected on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">by an admiral in norfolk navy base</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">he pointed out submarines are meant to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">sink and i can&#39;t like learn from that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">not to argue with a four-star you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">accept the ritual humiliation and get it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">out of the way because then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">listen to you thereafter so it grounded</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">right they nobody knew where it was so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">they gave</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">date the debt what data they had to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">multiple groups of experts around the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">including some nova scotia fishermen</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">because they know about the atlantic</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">yeah and all of them estimated where it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">none of them were remotely right but a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">probability distribution of all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">estimates was within 600 meters of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">actual submarine</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">all right now there are sound scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">and statistical reasons for this</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">and a large part of our work in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">is actually to move things into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also how we find the seventeen</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">the seventeen percent who&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">gorilla and can&#39;t understand why other</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:01.360" style="s2">people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">going back to the first lecture okay now</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.360" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">the other two liminal domains i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">to deal with in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">um because they&#39;re within confused and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of probably going to finish</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">so this is why you&#39;ll see if you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">canva now you&#39;ll see it&#39;s marked as ac</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">so this central domain of confused is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">actually a liminal domain</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">and confused now has two aspects being</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">confused and not being aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">actually puts you onto that catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">fold it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">place yeah the gray area is bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">the green however means you&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">you&#39;re confused so you can do something</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:43.039" style="s2">and we&#39;re calling that apparatic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">um it goes back to a whole philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.039" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">concept the whole rhetorical concept</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">um it&#39;s the concept of creating</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">paradoxes of ambiguity of unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">problems so that you think differently</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">about things</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">so this is all about actually triggering</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">a series of changes</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">the creation of apparea</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m not really prepared to simplify</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">so that leads me on to crisis management</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">and with this i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">you know wind up and finish and open up</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">for questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">so in a real crisis you&#39;ve got a i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">going to talk about this in the context</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">of covid because this is where i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">working for some time now</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got a major crisis the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">key thing you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:31.919" style="s2">is to do a draconian imposition of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">constraints to get you out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.919" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">the new zealand prime minister did this</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">yeah the us and the uk decided to wait</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">to see if they really had to do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">she did a lockdown because it gave her</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">more options</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">yeah the whole point about draconian</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">constraint is to do things to give you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">whether they&#39;re right or wrong yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">want to open up the option space</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">and that effectively is a shift into</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">operatic</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">the move you never do is to apply</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">existing best practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">that may well have got you there in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting and people will be arguing</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">for it but you shouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s your first stage this is all</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">as i say about to be published in the eu</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">handbook on</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">how to manage in a crisis which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re jointly producing between the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">canadian center and the european</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">commission</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">something which is rather ironic given</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">the stupidity of the english right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">blaming them entirely for brexit</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">um there are then other moves</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:43.920" style="s2">so the second move is a very simple one</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">um you&#39;ll probably find out that a whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.920" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">bunch of experts have been telling you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">what was going to go wrong and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">haven&#39;t been listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">now there&#39;s nothing wrong with that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">you&#39;re a senior decision maker because</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">the number of people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">tell you what you&#39;re doing wrong is huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">in legion</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:01.520" style="s2">and who you pay attention to is another</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">matter but now you can like know who you</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.520" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">so for example many governments haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">been paying attention to epidemiologists</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">so if you have this problem you invite</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">the experts in you apologize humbly you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">give them resource and you do what</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">you&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s one shift then a whole body of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">problems will be long then</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">but you may also have this really</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">interesting area which is the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">within complicated the one with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">question mark in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">that&#39;s where you&#39;ve got experts who</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">can&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">so we have that in britain with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">massive fight between epidemiologists</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">and behavioral economists</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">now that&#39;s where you have competing</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">expertise</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole body of techniques</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed i&#39;ve blogged about one</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">of those today if anybody wants to read</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">up on it</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">called a triopticum which is a highly</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">ritualized encounter between three</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">experts with multiple participants</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s ritualized it&#39;s short-term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">not designed to have people lobbying you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">it&#39;s designed to ritualize that process</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">so you can decide where things go so</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">that&#39;s movement number three</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">we then get the other two moves movement</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">number four</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">is you kind of like have a whole series</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">of hypotheses about what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">and you think you&#39;ve covered them all</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">right then you set up the safe to fail</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">small amounts of money to each different</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">idea we&#39;ve been doing that with</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">actually developing a vaccine there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">many different approaches to that so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">we&#39;re given different options here</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re not sure that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">all the hypotheses are</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">then you move into that liminal domain</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">with chaos because you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">out there there are things or ideas the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">17</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">that you need to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">now the key thing to decide on this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">do you go clockwise or anti-clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">yeah and the higher level of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a trigger point where you go and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">you go clockwise not anti-clockwise yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">you start</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">in that liminal domain with chaos but</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">uncertainty so you don&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">unless you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s much easier to go anti-clockwise as</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">you move around that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">so that basically is canaving</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">yeah um i just thought i&#39;d show this so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">you understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">some of the differences and also showing</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">the zimmerman framework and the stacy</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re based on human perception</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">right and actually balancing human</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">perception off kinevin is based on</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">actual ontology the nature of systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental divide</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">and ralph and i have argued about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">and barbara and i did when she was alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">yeah so you may see</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">other uses of the language but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">actually different</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">okay that&#39;s one of my cats yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">going to be an introduction to next</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">week&#39;s lecture um</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">that was when it was a kitten and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">first time it went out into the garden</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">that bird died shortly afterwards it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">killer</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">so that will introduce apex predators</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">next week but that was kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">summary of kinevin</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">a specific set of action at about</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">applications</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">um if you actually search for kinevin</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll find it&#39;s being used i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">you on google scholar the the use is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">legion i published a brilliant little</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">video recently from a group in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">um finland um who actually used it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">deprived children in helsinki and lack</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">of social housing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s taught in you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">command level in any of the american</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">military services without being taught</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">kinetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">all right so the whole thing is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">like just taken off in the ways that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect one of things i&#39;m proud</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">of is people can use it at different</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">levels it&#39;s fractal</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">people can look at it understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">use it without training but then they go</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">deeper and deeper and every time you go</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">deeper you find something else</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">and the reason for that is theory has</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">co-evolved with practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a one-time production</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">yeah as i talked with people the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">developed and additional things get</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">added</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a near finished state at</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure we can do much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">with it and but i&#39;ve said that before</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.200" style="s2">and lived to regret it so i&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">a firm commitment</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.200" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s a fundamental and another</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">phrase for this is multi-ontology</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">one of the big drivers for canavin was i</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">got fed up of management fads</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">yeah so we do something which made a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">difference and then it would stop making</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">a difference so we abandon it and start</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">again and i kept saying but it worked we</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">took it beyond its limitations there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">nothing wrong with business process</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">re-engineering</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.839" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">applied to core manufacturing but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">people tried to apply it to customer</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">service and it broke</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">so this is a concept called bounded</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">applicability</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">first work out the ontology and then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">epistemology follows</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">and actually one of the great things</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">about complexity if you&#39;re a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">is it allows contradictory ontological</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">states to coexist</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">and that resolves a lot of problems in</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">philosophy but also a lot of problems in</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a both and sense making framework</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">not a either or sense making framework</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">okay um i&#39;ve done the 40 minutes and now</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.839" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">one of my questions give</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">everyone a chance to put their questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">in the chat um</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">so yeah i never saw this this version of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">ken evan with</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">the dimension of liminality in it and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">was wondering you talked a bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">of the framework i&#39;m wondering how this</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">specific aspect</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">how do you how do you come up with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">and um what was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">experience like uh realizing or coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">up with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">and i&#39;ve just written 12 000 words on</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">the history of canavin which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">actually a complex metaphor with lord of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">the rings</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">and and there&#39;s going to be a prize the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">first person who can work out what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">referring to when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">peter jackson&#39;s total corruption of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">phalamia sorry</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">and that generation he destroys pharma</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">um and it was actually quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">i was looking at the different things</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">which contributed to it and actually art</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">was significant and that was significant</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">in liminality</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">and remember i said last week one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">functions of art in evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">is to allow abstraction so you make</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">novel connections</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">yeah so i had a problem which is people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand dynamics so we had</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">lots of different colored arrows moving</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">between domains and people didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">so they kept using it as a static</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">categorization framework</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">yeah they&#39;d often draw it as a two by</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">two and put a token circle in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">to stop me attacking them</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">yeah and so on and so forth yeah though</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been fairly tolerant over the years</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">and as i was you know in naples with my</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">daughter</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">um working with her on her anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">thesis so we had a father-daughter trip</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">to naples to study graffiti</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">if you want to study graffiti naples is</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">a great place the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">coincidentally went to a few other</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">places like good restaurants and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">herculean was</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">irrelevant right and father-daughter</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">trips were a lot of fun</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">um and we both loved caravaggio and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">were both</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">looking at the paintings in naples and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">then that contrast of light and shade</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">yeah and the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">you know he also uses common people</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">to represent complex ideas of represent</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">the idea of grace</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">you know the whole point about those</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">paintings is that in a constant state of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">and that was what triggered the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">liminality discussion</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">and if your daughter is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">anthropologist if you say is it liminal</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">then you then listen to a four-hour</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">lecture on liminality</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">yeah and then it all came from there so</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">that was actually how it came about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:45.119" style="s2">it was a problem which in the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:45.119" style="s2">context had a solution presented</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">oh yeah that&#39;s excellent um</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">so yeah so i&#39;ve seen some questions in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">the in the chat so</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">uh i believe peter snowden had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">question about exactation of play peter</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">would you</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">yeah sure no i mean it&#39;s just a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">small point but</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">um i remember reading um about</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">the role that play and non-proposal</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">activity played according to some um</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">archaeologists and anthropologists in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">the development of for instance</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">tools for human use and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">central function i&#39;m just wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">that plays</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">with the more i don&#39;t know biological</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">zoological concepts of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">i i think it does i think you know play</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">art art and music come before language</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">in human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s significant and play</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">obviously those as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">i think what all of them allow us to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">is to separate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">our set they they remove us from reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">so we can see it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">like that that&#39;s the value and although</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">it developed to something primitive it</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">then evolves with something very</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">sophisticated because of its utility</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s why actually um</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">stem education is plain bloody dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">for the species</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">you know because we&#39;re focusing on stem</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">education and actually from a species</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">point of view particularly with climate</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">change and everything else we need some</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">more generalists and we need people</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">you know have that ability to play to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">actually see things in art to see things</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">differently i get some of my best ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">at the opera</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">yeah particularly wagner because wagner</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">is transcendental so you go to another</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">place all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">in in terms of the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">and we know that ritual is important for</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">because ritual allows us to change we</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">work we view with the way we view the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">so the plus side for human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">to various in very sophisticated ways to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">separate ourselves from reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">the plus point is that makes us hugely</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">inventive the downside</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">is it makes us highly vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">and peter if you don&#39;t know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">probably within three degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">separation</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">as relatives because that the name the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">in both spelling comes from one small</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">village in northumberland and they only</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">left it about three generations ago</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">to be able to speak with you directly</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve been following you for years</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">in defining confused early on which is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">beautiful new term</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">you spoke about moving from chaotic to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">confused</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">and in my history of studying you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">in the past spoken about moving from</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">chaotic directly to complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">and so my question is in is this a is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">this part of something that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">changed as you&#39;ve moved as you&#39;ve added</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">the concept of liminality to the model</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">yeah and i think it is always dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">on this i turned up at auckland</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">university once to give a lecture on</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">canadian</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">and discovered it was a masters class</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">all of whom were writing theses on</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">connectivity and thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">and it gave me all these references they</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">thought i&#39;d read</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">and i was sitting there saying i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">read it i haven&#39;t read it honestly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s the problem yeah i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">used to say there were two exits from</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">from chaos one was to move to complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">the other was to move to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2">what was then simple and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">complex is safer because you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.200" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">we now actually have now changed that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2">and said it&#39;s better to move to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">yeah because that concept of our peria</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">gives you more options so yeah that is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think i was wrong before but</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a very dave snowden specific answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">thank you dave yeah and he&#39;s having</p>

<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">simplistic recipes</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you a story here i was mary</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">boone and i were having a phone call</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">going to write the book</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m writing it with mary because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">was good writing the harvard article</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.800" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">with her</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">like don tabstock very much but she does</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">but either way he gave us a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">book creation so we found that the book</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.839" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">agent go through the book plan</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">and he says no not interested and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">said why</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">he said too difficult too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">what i need from you is five books not</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">one book</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">and we said what do you mean and he said</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">you need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">understand the way this works what i</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">want is a book with a catchy title with</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">one idea with lots of cases</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">and i want one of those every 18 months</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">to two years</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">and we&#39;ll make our money on the speaker</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">fees and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">now i understand steve denning nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">taleb</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">all of these people that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">caught into right</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">and the idea of creating something which</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">is a contribution to the field his</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">contract because he actually said that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">he said no no no you</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">must claim originality it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">completely new</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">and i mean that&#39;s the problem i got with</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">talib and anti-fragility i mean the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">has been around for ages he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">bloody well invent it</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">yeah so i think those sort of simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">books are problematic</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">yeah and the other problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">confusion of correlation with causation</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">which is endemic</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got people who&#39;ll study ten</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">companies draw conclusions and think</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">they can trust in that and sorry my</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">background is in physics</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">no social scientist ever has enough data</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">to form any valid conclusion whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">as far as i&#39;m concerned uh and now</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the more recent ones i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">um well one of the books i really</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">despise</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">is reinventing the organization by</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">francester crooks</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">because that&#39;s a guy who&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">religious hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">about how things should be and he only</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">selects</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">aspects of his cases to support the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s becoming increasingly common</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2">yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">the use of partial aspects of cases</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">inadequate at the investigation to find</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">uh another one sorry you got me onto a</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">um another one is the concept of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">it called um the book of acts</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">oh god it&#39;s a really popular one i</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">forgot the name of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s about startup companies so it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">basically says you need to pivot and all</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">that sort of thing what&#39;s it called now</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">anybody remember lean startup</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">please yeah okay that&#39;s it all right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">i looked at that right this is a guy and</p>

<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">now that&#39;s a really bad sampling</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">technique</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">and he identifies things they did in</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:04.559" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">and then says if you do these things you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.559" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">will be successful</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">well i remember when i was in ibm&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">we did a project with dorothy leonard of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">harvard who&#39;s a serious academic</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">and we studied companies which have</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:20.559" style="s2">succeeded in companies who failed in</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">silicon valley</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.559" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">we actually study the ones who failed as</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">well as once succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">and we find they all did all the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">things there was no difference</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">yet the point is you had a market with</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">enough players that some are bound to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">succeed</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">all right so those i often use in</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">lectures as examples</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">we have got a very trivial attitude to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">book publishing at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">which is based on satisfying a need for</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">simplistic recipes</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">and easy answers and the problem as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">is our bloody politics is confounded by</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">that as well but</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">yeah thanks for that guidance uh we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">a question here with</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">two plus one so i&#39;m going to ask it um</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">ask the person to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">our beloved benito roy would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">hi benita</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">you&#39;re on mute i mean i i wish i could</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">currently on mute</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">well done i love the new kinevin and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen the uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">illustrations around but uh having you</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">present it was really cool</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">okay so this is kind of a a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">off topic</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">kind of hypothetical you know me um you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">the subtext in a lot of this work is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">that the world just gets more and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:47.760" style="s2">more and more and more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">and more chaotic maybe and i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">if you have a story</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">about the future in your mind where</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of bifurcation event</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">in which the ontology returns to simpler</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:02.960" style="s2">best practice dynamics due to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">you know some kind of integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.960" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">human mind or new realities</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">along the lines of you know people talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">about the release after the release</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">phase of anarchy do you see like just</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">the simple growing complexity or do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">see the the potential some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">catastrophic but advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:23.520" style="s2">bifurcation event</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not the extinction events after</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.520" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">which the cockroaches rule</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">right now this is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">um yeah no not that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">i i think there&#39;s a danger in this all</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">right in that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">and i say this as a as a good catholic</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">and somebody who&#39;s just starting a major</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">project to understand the numinous in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:46.079" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:47.839" style="s2">but there&#39;s a huge danger of us getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">mystical</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.839" end="00:55:53.040" style="s2">about all of this stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">and assuming that somehow or other there</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">will be some major</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">phase shift and you can see this in two</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">ways you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">in the total nonsense of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">we can put a human</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">brain into a computer yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">if you believe that it may be possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">for you because your brain is now</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">ossified to the point where it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">achievable</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">right um there&#39;s as much biology in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">is anything else i think the other one</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">is a sort of ken wilber integral</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">and the concept of higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">being in transition between it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">i mean the basic fact is we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">constantly evolving and changing and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">are losing and gaining capacity</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">um we could lose intelligence as well as</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">gain it</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">right and i actually think that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">problem at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">is connectivity and consequences not</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">so the world has always been complex but</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">the problem is it&#39;s now so</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">tightly connected and the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">of mistakes are so</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">high that we&#39;re at much higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m answering the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.079" end="00:57:06.960" style="s2">really but i wouldn&#39;t predicate action</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">on that as hope um terry eagleton</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.960" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">um if you haven&#39;t read terry eagleton</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">he&#39;s hugely prolific</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a single book of his which</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">um his latest is called radical</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">yeah um but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:25.839" style="s2">got one which is looking at hope yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:28.559" style="s2">and i can&#39;t i mean two seconds i&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.839" end="00:57:28.559" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s called hope hope without optimism</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">now that&#39;s i mean terry and i were both</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">editors of slant the catholic marxist</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">journal back in the 70s he comes from</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">that background</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">and both of us read milt moltmann if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t read theology of hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:57.760" style="s2">yeah and i think one of the big things</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to start to introduce into</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.760" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">sense making is this concept of hope</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">without optimism because the danger is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">if you have hope with optimism which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.400" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">the wilbur problem you end up</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">withdrawing from the world you&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">got the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">excuse to withdraw from action</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">so so that would be a but you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">every now and then i was trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">the bloody scapula you gave me but i</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">can&#39;t find it now it&#39;s there somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting hypothetical i</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">mean i i agree with you we have to live</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">in the world that we have and not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">uh in the world that we think is coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">or some</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">hypothesized but yeah thank you this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">notion of decoupling</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">uh loose loose coupled connectivity but</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">looser coupling i know you&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">about it that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">the move we&#39;re looking for the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">thing which is worth reading at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">moment is this one</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">yeah because that that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">going beyond the anthracene</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">um and david david is really good on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">anthracene as well so that there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">some serious academic texts on looking</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">at this</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">concept theological shift uh stephanie</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:10.640" style="s2">wakefield also</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">i there&#39;s a group of what i call post</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">anthropic thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:17.040" style="s2">that are i would say that they&#39;re able</p>

<p begin="00:59:17.040" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">uh be patient in the limbo</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">spaces that you&#39;re talking about and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">get to do sound talk i mean remember i</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">spent a lot of the 70s in kakadu</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">in northern australia yeah working</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">with indigenous communities and that was</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">hugely educational actually a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">techniques like ritual descent came from</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">what&#39;s fascinating indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">communities is all this bloody nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:47.119" style="s2">about everybody being nice to each other</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.119" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">reality of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">neolithic lifestyle requires something a</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:56.319" style="s2">little bit more sensible than that</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t seen it tan canoes is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.319" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">brilliant film as well</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">yeah and jan caporta was on the store</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">and he was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">people torturing each other or something</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">or you know kind of giving that flavor</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">of tribal society punishing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">he was saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">anyway thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">that was a great exchange of the i would</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">love to hear dave talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:26.839" style="s2">uh these religious topics more sometime</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">with hope and sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.839" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">um well yeah we have a question by dan</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">feldman dan would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">uh yeah sure let&#39;s can you can you copy</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">it down in the bottom again</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">for me i believe it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s nice just nice to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">dave i&#39;ve been uh reading your stuff for</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">quite a while</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">um my question is what</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">is uh a multi-ontology</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">sense-making way to translate what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">typically called the problem and</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">solution in the ordered space</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">how would you translate problem and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">solution into the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">into the other domains that language i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:12.960" style="s2">i may or may not have understood the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:13.599" style="s2">question but let me try some answers all</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.960" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.599" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">one of the ways that we work i mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:18.559" style="s2">first of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:20.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ll do this next week when i do</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.559" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">apex predator theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.160" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">complexity is taking off at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">i remember when systems thinking went</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">from academic idea to dominant</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">concept and took about three to four</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.240" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s actually very fast when it</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">happens it&#39;s a phase shift it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.240" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">gradual shift and we&#39;re seeing that with</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">which worries some of us because the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">wrong type of complexity you think it</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:46.960" style="s2">could come out on top</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">yeah and and that&#39;s why i and others</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.960" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">make quite rigid distinctions between</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">systems thinking and complexity thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want confusion between</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">the two</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">now we can go into that later yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">certainly i&#39;ve introduced it over the</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">years is to find intractable problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">don&#39;t go for the low hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">yeah governments and industry and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">higher up you get the more they get</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to be on the board of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">major international company without</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">understanding that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">stuff you can never know</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">and i mean one of the other frameworks i</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:28.559" style="s2">developed back in 1980 was an</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">uncertainty matrix which compared</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.559" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">known unknowns and then nobles</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">right um and that was an ontology</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">epistemology framing</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">and i remember presenting that in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">pentagon once a few years ago at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">request of john poindexter and after</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">that i couldn&#39;t use it again for about</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:47.039" style="s2">four or five years because it got</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">tainted</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.039" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">yeah but yeah i still use that with</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:55.680" style="s2">executives so if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">unknowable unknowns</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.680" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">you can&#39;t apply conventional wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">the other one which is really scary for</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">executives is</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">unknown gnomes so that&#39;s where people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">your organization know what to do but</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that they know it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">yeah so you start to focus them on those</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">and then they&#39;re prepared to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">complexity methods</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">right the other thing is tools are</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">important i mean one of the reasons we</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:23.839" style="s2">developed sensemaker apart from it being</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">counterterrorism</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.839" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">was the ability to demonstrate something</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">like if we do this you can see this look</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">at that picture what you think</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">it means is that&#39;s one of the other ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">you make it tangible for people</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.039" style="s2">now i may not have answered the question</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">you asked i answered the question i</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.039" end="01:03:44.559" style="s2">heard</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s always a danger well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.559" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s the use of the word</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">solution a lot of people you know they</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">whatever the problem is whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">complicated problem or usually it&#39;s a if</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a social problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:58.720" style="s2">uh most of the time it&#39;s in the complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">space for my assessment</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.720" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">and it tends to be this is the problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:06.799" style="s2">that has multiple complex untangled</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">roots and here&#39;s our solution and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">somehow that is that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">that i cringe when i hear that there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">parts of it that you can do i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">there are three basic principles of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">complexity management all right so one</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.039" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">optimize the granularity of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">which generally means smaller things the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">other is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:30.000" style="s2">distribute and diversify cognition</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">and the third is disintermediate</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.000" end="01:04:32.720" style="s2">decision makers</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.119" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">if you follow those three you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.720" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">far wrong and people keep talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">a system as being complex or complicated</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">when actually aspects of it are complex</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:43.520" style="s2">and aspects of it are complicated</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">so one of the things kinevin is designed</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.520" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">to do is to find the things which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.599" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">complex which you know what to do about</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:52.000" style="s2">and also to find the things in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">complex domain and i can</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.000" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">do this next week if people remind me</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">because one of the key things we do with</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">executives is constraint mapping</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">because constraints are ordered aspects</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">of a complex system</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">so one of the ways you can change things</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.119" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">is to change the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">okay excellent</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">peter limberg your question had a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">oneplus so i&#39;m going to let you ask your</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">cool all right so</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">the question is uh any good examples</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">current or past of political and or</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">social movements consciously imposing</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">states of liminality between the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:39.760" style="s2">ontological domains</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">in order to enact change interest and uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.760" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">temporary autonomous owned by the that</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">anarchist</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.400" end="01:05:47.920" style="s2">hakeem bay comes to mind uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:49.440" style="s2">yeah you you shouldn&#39;t talk to a former</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.920" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">catholic marxist leninist</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.440" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">about our anarchists you know we</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">we kind of have two methods to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">them one involves pickaxes and the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">involves altered the phase</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">right um and anarchism always gives way</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">to fascism by the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">um i think there are liminal states i</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">mean you could argue the mensheviks were</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">a liminal state</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">in the russian revolution i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:18.160" style="s2">aloud here</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:20.240" style="s2">right um i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.160" end="01:06:21.839" style="s2">i think the problem with anarchism is</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.240" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s too informed by</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.839" end="01:06:28.559" style="s2">libertarian concepts of identity</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:30.160" style="s2">so it over focuses on the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.559" end="01:06:31.920" style="s2">when we talk about this last time the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.160" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">difference between social atomism and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.920" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">communitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">and um i think if you get</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">communitarianism you get the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:41.039" style="s2">our identities are collective not</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:42.400" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.039" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">then there are multiple states of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.400" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">liminality that could exist</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">right um we&#39;re doing some work at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:51.760" style="s2">moment which if anybody&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:52.880" style="s2">happy to talk to more people about on</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.760" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">the whole issue about</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.880" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">citizen juries and citizen assemblies</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re looking at ways and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">doing some of this with extinction</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:03.039" style="s2">rebellion</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.160" style="s2">which hopes uh the deciding which quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:06.240" style="s2">fancy is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.160" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">uk prime minister making me a terrorist</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.240" end="01:07:09.039" style="s2">again i&#39;ve always wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.520" end="01:07:12.640" style="s2">terrorist</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.039" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">um sorry the uk prime minister is</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.640" end="01:07:16.000" style="s2">planning to ban</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">ban climate change activists as</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.000" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">terrorists it&#39;s ridiculous right</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:21.359" style="s2">so we&#39;re doing some work with them at</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">the moment on um</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.359" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">actually using mass engagement to inform</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:26.799" style="s2">citizen assemblies</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">because one of the things we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.799" end="01:07:31.440" style="s2">start doing is rethinking democracy</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">because democracy wasn&#39;t designed to</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.440" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">work with populations of the size we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:42.799" style="s2">with the long-term consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">a short-term decision focus all right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.799" end="01:07:46.319" style="s2">the current political system is not only</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.319" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s potentially going to kill us</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">right so that&#39;s one of the areas we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">working and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">is actually about creating liminality of</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">decisions to allow new</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:02.240" style="s2">new solutions to emerge right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:05.359" style="s2">something which doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:07.280" style="s2">in a two-party state or a one-person</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.359" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">one-vote state</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.280" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">where people are effectively yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">abbreviating their ideas it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:15.760" style="s2">either if you delegate your ideas</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">electronically that&#39;s a cute idea but</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.760" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">that won&#39;t work either</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">so i think one of the things where a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">of us are trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:26.719" style="s2">is to create more liminality</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">yeah because liminality keeps options</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.719" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">open for longer</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:36.960" style="s2">that&#39;s great um we&#39;re kind of running</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.359" end="01:08:39.520" style="s2">out of time so maybe we can have</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.960" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">one or two more questions we&#39;ll see um</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.520" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">jeff</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">jeff irving would you like to ask a</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:50.159" style="s2">oh hi um yeah thanks um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">i won&#39;t try to reread what i what i</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">wrote</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:54.799" style="s2">what was on my mind was whether if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">could speak</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.799" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">to how people&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">default preference of how they see</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">operating within a preferred domain so</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:10.159" style="s2">uh hi i&#39;m jeff</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">i think of myself as particularly suited</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.159" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:18.080" style="s2">making sense of the world from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">complex domain interferes with</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.080" end="01:09:24.799" style="s2">how i could effectively leverage kinevin</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">i think i mean two things on this side i</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.799" end="01:09:28.080" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go down a myers-briggs</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.080" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">um i mean that that&#39;s one of the worst</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">pseudo-sciences around at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:36.880" style="s2">and people who put their myers-briggs</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">scores on their business card</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.880" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">need therapy fast in my view right</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:44.719" style="s2">um reality is most of us are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">operating in all domains very quickly in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.719" end="01:09:48.480" style="s2">fact we always do it i mean the one</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:50.400" style="s2">i mean the children&#39;s party story which</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.480" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">you can look up online</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:53.920" style="s2">which is the best teaching story i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">ever created</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.920" end="01:09:57.760" style="s2">yeah fundamentally makes the point that</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">we manage our children on the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.760" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">that a complex adaptive system so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.600" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">know how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">yeah in terms of the way where we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:06.960" style="s2">things so all of that&#39;s available</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">we do to have done some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.960" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">projects one things i did in singapore</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">and singapore funded a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">experimentation on this</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">is we actually created the canadian</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:19.920" style="s2">framework with</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:22.320" style="s2">six ministries and they worked in cross</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">ministry teams so we created it</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:26.640" style="s2">with lots of exemplar narratives to</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">define the domains and the boundary</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.640" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">and we sent them away for two weeks and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">we brought them back and put them into</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:35.840" style="s2">ministry teams</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">and we gave them all of the exemplars</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.840" end="01:10:39.120" style="s2">but without the way they were positioned</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">and asked them to create the canadian</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.120" end="01:10:42.000" style="s2">framework for it</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">and they created six completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.000" end="01:10:46.560" style="s2">different versions even though they all</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">worked together before</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.560" end="01:10:50.480" style="s2">yeah so what you actually found is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">foreign office but everything every</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.480" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">everything was simple or</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">clear because they just wrote reports</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">after the event</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.199" style="s2">ministry defense i was quite proud of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">but there again i was an advisor and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.199" end="01:11:02.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve been training them for five years</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">they could they kept near the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.159" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.199" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">yeah and the home office put everything</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:08.880" style="s2">into complicated if you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">well they&#39;re evidence-based they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.880" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:16.159" style="s2">yeah so that was fascinating because</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:18.239" style="s2">we then put the we created the charts</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.159" end="01:11:19.600" style="s2">and said well we see it like this you</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.239" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">see it like that there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:21.960" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">but we need to realize there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.960" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">miscommunication there</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s something called</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">descriptive self-awareness one things we</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">do a lot i mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">the famous case on this is a sense maker</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">one where we were working on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:38.640" style="s2">um aroma problem within europe</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:41.920" style="s2">so we got roma kids to act as</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.640" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">ethnographers to roma people in hungary</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.920" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">and they got access to data nobody has</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">ever got before</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:50.400" style="s2">yeah no external research would get that</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.480" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">and then we took clusters of narrative</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.400" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">which has been indexed the same way by</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:55.600" style="s2">roma people</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">and we gave it to the european union</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.600" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">anthropologists in vienna and said</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">interpret this the way you think roma</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">interpreted it</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">and then we showed them the difference</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:06.960" style="s2">and the difference was huge</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">this happens a lot all right and there</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.960" end="01:12:11.360" style="s2">are three responses to this</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:12.960" style="s2">one response is to say oh my god we</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.360" end="01:12:15.679" style="s2">should see it the same way they do and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.960" end="01:12:17.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.679" end="01:12:19.120" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t do it you&#39;re an expert</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.360" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t see things the same way unless</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:22.400" style="s2">you&#39;re gerard calls this a gradient</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between you</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">the difference is actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.840" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">creative if you accept it</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.400" end="01:12:30.719" style="s2">yeah um so the right one is to say that</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.239" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.719" end="01:12:34.080" style="s2">the really bad one is what we got from</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:35.679" style="s2">the anthropologists in vienna is they</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.080" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">don&#39;t understand their own stories we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.679" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">the experts we understand what they</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">really mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:44.239" style="s2">and that is ever so common in what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:46.560" style="s2">call distributed ethnography</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">the expert can&#39;t cope with being shown</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.560" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">the difference so</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.480" style="s2">a lot of the work you do around</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:12:52.320" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.480" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">is to constantly throw people into</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.320" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">positions where they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">challenge the process right</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:13:00.400" style="s2">if you come in as an expert they can</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">challenge your expertise or they can</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.400" end="01:13:04.159" style="s2">challenge the process</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">if you take them through a process and</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.159" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">they can&#39;t challenge it and they can see</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">that as a result of the process they saw</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:12.080" style="s2">it like this and you saw it like that</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:13.840" style="s2">then you have a chance to change and</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.080" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the ways kinevin is used</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.840" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">in practice</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.560" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">so yeah i think i&#39;m afraid we have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.480" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">end there i apologize</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">to everyone else who had questions uh</p>
