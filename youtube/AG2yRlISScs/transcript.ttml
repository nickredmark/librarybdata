<p begin="00:00:01.199" end="00:00:06.799" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.760" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">today we&#39;re discussing a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.799" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">lecture that um john did at some</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">university i&#39;m not sure which</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">um after watching it myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">and trying to make notes it just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">well my orientation was to try and make</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">it super relevant to rip now</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">or the general project but a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">just seemed like general facts about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:39.440" style="s2">you know how the mind works and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">so i sort of had some trouble making it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.440" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">i know as relevant as i wanted it to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:47.920" style="s2">to rip now so i&#39;m hoping everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">has got better notes than me basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.920" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">and just for the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:53.199" style="s2">listening to this later what&#39;s the name</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">of the video</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.199" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">uh one second</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s the meaning crisis religion and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">religion in the 21st century by john</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">becky yeah and when i upload this to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">youtube i&#39;ll i&#39;ll put a link</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">to it in the show notes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.439" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">um so yeah if anyone else wants to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">their notes i&#39;d be grateful</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">i um i do have a thought i&#39;d like to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">on the table</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">uh just to kick us off perhaps i found</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">it very very relevant</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.680" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">uh like i&#39;m first just a disclaimer</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">um i only got through about</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">i would say three quarters of the video</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:39.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">so i haven&#39;t completely finished</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.280" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">watching it um but one thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">really stood out for me was</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">this idea of how the processes</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">that afford us intelligence have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">a built-in tendency</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">for self-deception and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">to religion that&#39;s on a religion for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">is how in community</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">they might be or there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">other ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">process information make decisions do</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">a different form of intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">can help us counteract self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">and for me i think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s very relevant to religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve sort of discussed well john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">definitely discussed</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">about collective rationality and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">collective rationality&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">so important well one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">reasons is because um</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">yeah like we all we&#39;re all biased but</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">all of our biases aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">so we can help to correct each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">bias and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">reduce the bias reduce</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">a certain amount of bias that we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">not produce by ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">and yeah i&#39;m not sure on the specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">fix of how we&#39;d set things up on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">planets</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">and i think it was the 13th</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">episode of the awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">meaning crisis videos</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">he talked about reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">and the opposite reciprocal opening as</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">being the path to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">as uh talked about by the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">so um i guess it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of relevant to retina in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">the reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">is what we&#39;re trying to avoid or prevent</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">yeah and the reciprocal opening that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">want to achieve right</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">which i think is is interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">the idea of intelligence can somehow be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">transformed from our current way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">thinking about it in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">mainstream society and culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where for me especially the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">of religion that&#39;s another religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">comes in it&#39;s because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">this shared understanding the shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">vocabulary outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">if we can understand and define</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">intelligence differently than we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">currently today</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">in today&#39;s meaning crisis um i think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">help create much better affordance to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">tap into the mechanisms we can use to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">counteract</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:37.759" style="s2">not only counteract self-deception but</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">have effective ways of leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.759" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">each other&#39;s intelligence right or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">or collective rationality i guess you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">could say but more than that for me for</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">rationality is uh it may be a partner of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">or a component of it but it&#39;s or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">know it has a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">intelligence but it&#39;s not intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">itself in a way yeah i like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">definition where rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">where your your intelligence um</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">is how you learn and you then when your</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">intelligence is learning about your</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">to improve itself that&#39;s rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m gonna paste uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">if that&#39;s well maybe let me just read it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">and then you can tell me if it&#39;s okay if</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:28.880" style="s2">i paste it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">just to keep it in front of us but uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">the quote directly out of the videos</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">intelligence is about problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">and rationality is about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">overcome the self-deception that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">out of your attempts to solve your</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">oh yeah i don&#39;t think i write this down</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">but i thought of um</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">the phrase that i feel like puts that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">it reveals what i sort of just said</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">which was uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">so yeah intelligence is problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">and then rationality is solving the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">problem of problems so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">the problems of problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">ah that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">so in terms of the the video</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">the video&#39;s relationship with religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">you mentioned at the start of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">session that</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">the reason you wanted to use the video</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">was to to look at how to apply it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">this context of religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">religion right</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">can you elaborate a little bit more of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">it of what your</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">intuition was about the value</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">oh um so are you sort of asking me why i</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">picked this video</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">yeah um because it was the second video</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">john&#39;s channel and we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">that that&#39;s literally the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">i picked it that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">each video every two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">okay so so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">written r and and improving</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">i guess you know i can see it coming in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">in terms of psycho technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">teach people to better</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">navigate through self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">and maybe classes for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s a sunday school type</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">type situation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">you know on on different techniques of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">of controlling for one&#39;s own bias or</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">helping each other control</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">for bias you know logical fallacies and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">the like</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">can i jump in here guys of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">thank you um i&#39;m picking up a bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">uh the bias side which was mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">earlier sorry there&#39;s a few threads</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve got to be quick but um</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">my understanding from looking at john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">cognitive science course on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">youtube channel is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">bias is from the science point of view</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">linked</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">to heuristics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">so using heuristics like shortcuts</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">mental shortcuts</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.480" style="s2">to or rules oh sorry not rules really</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.580" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.480" end="00:08:35.580" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">well let&#39;s say shortcuts like max rules</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">rules of thumb that&#39;s great um which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">great it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">solve a problem but he&#39;s saying that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">intrinsic to that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">the heuristic&#39;s are freighted with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">biases</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">so you get the shortcut you get to where</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">you&#39;re going but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">you will then be subject to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">uh getting a bit trapped by some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">which is why he emphasizes you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">learning those cognitive biases etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">but he&#39;s putting that in the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">frame of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">um heuristics as one approach to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">problem solving going back to what i</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">velocin said about intelligence i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">that was you velocin sorry</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">um and then the other way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">intelligence is that logical inferential</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">way so he seems to have those two big</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">and plays them off against each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">and then something else emerges</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">in between which he&#39;s calling relevance</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s intelligence sorry i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">being a bit general guys but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;s adding something</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">you definitely added something because</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">you basically have</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve basically elucidated one of well</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">maybe the main way in which intel</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">like the things that make us intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">also make us</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">foolish like right that it just is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">how it works probably most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">all right so so we&#39;re subject as people</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">to a whole slew of cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">and these cognitive biases are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">baked in so so they&#39;re they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">hard to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">but but they can be controlled at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">to some extent you know by</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">by applying certain techniques so so i</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">mean for example you know meditation can</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">uh you know insight meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">contemplative meditation can help</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">with creating the proper frame you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">can help help with</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">with with frame making and frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">uh you know biases related to how we</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">treat one another</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">can be addressed with things like d</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">logos you know so the bias</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">you know often you know discussions you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">know we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">self-deception with how we view the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">other person and the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">psycho technology can help can help</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">you know help make us better at putting</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">ourselves in the other person&#39;s shoes</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">help really help us really listen to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">them not talk past one another</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">and so on um you know what so we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">you know you could have other exercises</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">develop at assessing the proper frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">because you know we get we have biases</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">where we zero in on one perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">and we don&#39;t see the other perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">and and we&#39;re not using we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">get come too attached so so we could so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">so we we could identify just</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">a bunch of these ways we</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">self-deceive and then figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">what psychotechnologies we can use to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">help us</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">get better at controlling for them</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">i guess here&#39;s a this sort of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a project</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">if anyone is or wants to be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">the cognitive biases we could</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">try and work out like more day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">real-life</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">examples of where the biases actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">make a difference to people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">so i can imagine people hearing about</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">all these cognitive biases and it just</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">being like</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">okay well i&#39;m not a scientist so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">does it matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s another problem that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">people think and you know i</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">i&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">the skeptic community</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">and you know the skeptic slash atheist</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">community where people think just</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">knowing about psych about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">biases is enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">not to be subject to them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">just patently untrue</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">you know you know i mean knowing about</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">them helps i mean don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">you know knowing the list of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">different types of cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">is very helpful and that gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">edge over someone who&#39;s never seen them</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">but it is not enough on its own just to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">know about</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">these cognitive biases if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">actively applying methods</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">to help counter them then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">probably succumbing to them</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the third party effects right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a effect known in psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">know that oh a lot so many lots</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">of marriages will end in divorce that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">you never apply it to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">you you can know that um oh if you if</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">you smoke there&#39;s a very high chance</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">you&#39;ll apply</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll die of lung cancer i know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">a high chance</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">that you&#39;ll die of lung cancer but i</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think that i&#39;ll die of lung cancer</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">yeah the cognitive bias is always in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">one&#39;s neighbor&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s called it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">third party effect and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">other people are subject to this but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">not because i know about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">you just had can can i just make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">comment there</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">um the reason is because uh sorry is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">shiver any yeah hi hi</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">uh the reason it&#39;s interesting is while</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">you and veloskin were interacting i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">reading</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:28.839" style="s2">through the cognitive bias book that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">john&#39;s got us doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.839" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">sanger uh and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">it sort of strikes a midpoint between</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">in that i i don&#39;t find the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">biases very wet</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">as i find them a bit dry</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">and so as i&#39;m sort of doing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">discipline i find myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">translating the dryness with a maxim</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">again so let me just give you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">an example in this book okay it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">cognitive biases a pocket reference book</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">and i just saw veloskin doing just what</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">i was doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">so there&#39;s this one called loss aversion</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">and they they have a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">loss of aversion is the brain&#39;s tendency</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">to prefer</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">avoiding losses as compared to receiving</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">gains</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">that is the stronger effect of loss on</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">emotions versus gain</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">and i just wrote a note that&#39;s the glass</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">half empty</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">so do you see it as half empty or half</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">full</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">and i think veloskin was doing a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">a reference to jesus before</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">is that right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">yeah so think so it seems as though</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">to bridge the gap going to brett&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">cognitive biases are actually proverbs</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">proverbs um maxims</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">anyway well i i think what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">is we can use the psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been just doing through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">wisdom of hypatia of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">of coming up with maxims and memorizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">and to choose maxims around the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">to help keep them in mind because that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">is an important that is an important</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">of controlling for biases is is being</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">able to identify them and keep them in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">so coming up with pithy statements to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">help you remember to look out for these</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">biases in your own and others thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">uh would be would be a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">or an application of the i&#39;m is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">i&#39;m forgetting i&#39;m forgetting which one</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s related to but uh you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re doing now</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">yes it&#39;s epicurus uh maxims so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">remember how</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">john was saying the epicureans carved to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">the maxims into their houses</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">and stuck them onto their cups like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">post-it note</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">almost right so this is one way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">that psychotechnology can be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">yes i think so i mean i i don&#39;t walk</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">around saying oh i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">i&#39;m um i&#39;m doing the anchoring bias</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">right like like like i see</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">like i see uh psychotechnologies is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">huge part of retina</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">like so that&#39;s that&#39;s i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">major focus that has to be a major focus</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">in any</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">kind of written our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">on these type of things is what psycho</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">technologies can we bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">to that task and this is what manuel and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">and mark have been working on this as</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">well in terms of classifying</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">these psycho technologies into different</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">things that they can afford</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">so um i i personally</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">use maxims and the such</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">as a heuristic psychotechnology in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve developed a a system of of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">a principled structure of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">categorical concepts</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">that i&#39;ve reduced to simple phrases that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">i can relate to any</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">circumstance i&#39;m in but are context</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">specific to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">emphasize certain circumstance and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">very first one</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">is i am the only problem that i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">and i use it as my foundational entry</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">into into any moment of problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">formulation because i&#39;m grounding it</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">upon what i consider to be two basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">components of being alive and that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">what john highlights as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">the having mode and the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">or the becoming mode both of these are</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">processes of problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">goal orientation operations functions</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">that in my recognition of i am the only</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">problem i&#39;ve ever had and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">merely the fact of me being alive</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">necessitates problem in my life</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">that all of life is in effect some</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">semblance of tool</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">or problem and so i don&#39;t want to go on</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">too far</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">into the details of the specificity i</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">just wanted to bring up that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">i personally use that great effect and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s very thankful</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">great that&#39;s a good way to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">fire logic yeah it has helped me quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">actually um because the blame finger</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">takes away</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">accountability and accountability takes</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">away self-control self-empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">uh capacity to respond the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">in an effective way and uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s help kept me yes very honest</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">in a sense it does does tie it back into</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">velocity and too</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">which is how he was saying the jesus</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">quote</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">uh what is it um it&#39;s like you</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">but you do not see the log in your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">or whatever yes that&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a bit what biologic is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">doing there</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:17.760" style="s2">i i just believe it&#39;s very important for</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">just any individual to to find a uh a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.760" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">relationship with what could be</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">considered general truths</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">of this nature because it&#39;s just a like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">a one-stage</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">filter to anxiety and distress in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">as long as they have a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">it so speaking they can invoke it</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">and have an effect which is a practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">having a load of maxims would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">go well with trying to create a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">retinal culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">because we&#39;d all be kitten into each</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">but like i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">the the moment something becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">cliche</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">it it gets this value judgment right</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">where it&#39;s it&#39;s ignored it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">idea of i know the maxim therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">i um i&#39;m good at applying it or</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">embodying it which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">obviously another cognitive bias right</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d agree you might say oh yes i</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">know this maxim i know this maxim i know</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">what it means</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">same way people know that they&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">to drive at the speed limit</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">i think this is where uh something</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">that&#39;s a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">some religions is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">quite interesting is where they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">ceremonies or celebrations</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">uh where it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">savoring the meaning of even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">symbolic meaning of metaphoric meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">of let&#39;s say certain maxims right</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">and it could be an enacted maxim not</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">you know one that&#39;s just a bunch of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">like a proverbial phrase um</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">and and that can counteract this effect</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">of saying oh something just becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">cliche</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">because you you know it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">recognizing oh i&#39;m familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">maxim but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">um making sure that one has a first-hand</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">experience of what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">means to embody the maxim</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s how things like ceremonies</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">rituals those types of things can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">can perhaps be very powerful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">even more than that right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">have an embodied sense of development</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">right like just having a rule somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.679" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">in in in fancy colors and with a picture</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.679" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">next to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to help it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">just a rule right you need you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">get there right you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">see why the rule is important it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">not used just to have the rule</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting it makes me think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">how john quotes harry frankfurt and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">talks about bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">and how we have to learn how to not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">bullshit ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">and how that might be something to watch</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">out for with maxims</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">so i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">please go ahead uh i well i</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">want to agree with everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">been said but i also want to just put</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">forth an additional</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">psych technology that i that i utilize</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">in that specific maxim previously</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">because maybe this might spark something</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">is that i have an actual device that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">that i attach to my wrist and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">interacts with my hand</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">that creates a problem in my life and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">the wearing of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">i have to i have i have these rules that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">i notice immediately if i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">following because i&#39;m not adhering to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">this because this thing becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">problem it starts getting caught</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">getting in the way and there&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">wheel of metal on the end</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">of a paracord so i have to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">to this additional element of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">articulation in the freedoms of my body</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">that is constantly occurring on this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">this pre-attentive level</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">because if i&#39;m wearing it throughout my</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">day i&#39;ve just added an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">problem to my life i have reformulated</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">the problem of self to have an</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">of enactment that i must adapt to and as</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">i not only have to mitigate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">but i have to find a way to mitigate the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">problem in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">develops a harmonic with the way that my</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">i i just i guess my point here is kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">of in the ecology of practice point of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">which i believe is very uh religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">oriented is that all of these approaches</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">must be constant in a certain sense to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">uh to address</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">what john is referencing by um</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">self-deception and relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s i mean am i wrong in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">assumption that the goal here is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">find very specific psych technologies</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">access all of the part of a person so to</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">and then to formulate an ecology so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">um get it all the parts they can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">see so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">in communal expression</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">but that&#39;s the end goal no i i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">the goal is at least where i am marker</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">going</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to generate certain</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">and they need fixes for the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">what you want to do is you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">a way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">recognize where your problem is in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">efficient way and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">find a way to deal with it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">adhering to your personality and your</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">specific situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">in relation to time and attention and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">all that stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where i&#39;m working at least we</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">want to fix the problem itself then</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">so to speak the the intrinsic problems</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">impede our decision-making process and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">our developmental growth</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">no perennial we don&#39;t want to fix</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">anything we want to give people the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">opportunity to fix</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">themselves we want to give them the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">tools that they need</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">to grow as people basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">no okay so the fix is the wrong term um</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">but the goal here is still to provide</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">means of resolution which in and of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">itself is a resolution of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">yeah sort of um i think use the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to we&#39;ve got a load of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">perennial problems we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">cope with them like we&#39;re trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">better but</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">the word people have a problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">word fix i think because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s got this very discreet sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">i fixed it now and that&#39;s it but that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">i concur i i i concur it was a poor term</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">for the circle no no it&#39;s no problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why people might object</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">yeah and coping by contrast suggests a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">more ongoing thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">yeah and i think uh john is dead set</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">against that from what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">understood i think he even</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">uh in a very knowing way talks about</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">being against</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">quote the final solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">so i prefer</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">i prefer the term resolution myself</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">yeah i think the point is going into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">ways of knowing that um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a very propositional way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">at things if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">say i&#39;m gonna fix it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">if we went down to the other end it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">much more participatory way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">at by saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">i&#39;m in a process of of addressing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">and yeah we really want to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an important distinction we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">not saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">come come to us and we&#39;ll fix your</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">problems we&#39;re not fixing your problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying is come to us and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">will teach you strategies that you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">to deal with your problems in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">everyday in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">to find meaning in your life yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">tools of use are being offered</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">that&#39;s yes we&#39;re not solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">we&#39;re solving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">of problem solving basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">which is essentially my original point</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">about that it&#39;s still it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">like in the end when you get down to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">that but it&#39;s decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s specific sorry ronnie we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">a little background noise</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">right at this point like i said i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">with um the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">we&#39;re still doing a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">defining okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">what problems we&#39;re looking at solving</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve got the list of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">um perennial problems and perennial</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">needs and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">um i think we&#39;ve got someone working on</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">a list of uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">drives and motivations as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">is that right</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">i think that&#39;s um manas</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about um the values</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">now are those things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">extract from this video we just watched</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">very specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">specifically no those things from that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">video now</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">if you have a look well say non-linearly</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">then just in the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">that self-deception can</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">cascade into more specific problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant to the values</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">okay what i would say there at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">from my thinking so far in working on</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">the values is the problem is that of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">what that is taught in the video of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">heuristics with</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">that risk of bias right so in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">written or</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">next channel i posted some examples of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">just trying to figure out if you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">for lack of a better way to put it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">structure of values</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">and um perhaps a better way to word it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">is to say the heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">of values</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">for example it&#39;s good self-preservation</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">is a good value</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">if you can take care of yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">that has a lot of benefits</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">you can be a productive member of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">community but what happens when the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">community is under serious threat</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">then the opposite of self-preservation</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">starts becoming an affordable</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">value which is self-sacrifice right like</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">the the warrior archetype and saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna fight for the survival of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">um as an example and and those two</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">things are polar opposites</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">on a bias or should we say heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">of what is the appropriate thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">or what is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">uh quote-unquote right thing to do what</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">is the relevant thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i think makes right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">what makes values kind of a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">fun</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">to play with and work with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">not the values themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">that feels like it&#39;s meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">space that values live in if i can put</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">it like that you know the space of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">and yeah this is virtues like why why</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">are we talking about values or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">is there a distinction i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">say like</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">what you&#39;re you called the values in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">that thing you posted</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.159" style="s2">like it&#39;s just a it&#39;s literally a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">like you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.159" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">you&#39;re describing aristotelian style</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.840" style="s2">where it&#39;s uh finding the relevant spot</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.840" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">extremes so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">absolutely open for updating my how</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">should i say</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">the way that i&#39;d uh the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">vocabulary that i&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">definitions and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">the reason i want to shy away from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">idea of virtue is because</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">i want to make space for</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">for a lack of a better way of saying the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">dark side of means because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">space right because of the bias</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">because of context now one might argue</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">what virtue does it already brings that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">into being but um i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">of stereotype of stigma when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">about virtue right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">archetype of the the good and the light</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">and the you know the hero archetype</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">right not</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">as opposed to let&#39;s say the renegade you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">know or the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">um which also has a place right and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">i&#39;m feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">if i perhaps if i stay away from that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">uh maybe just my subjective meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">i&#39;m that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">linking to to virtue if i try and stay</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">away from that i can make space</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">for a more comprehensive view of values</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">of course thank you thank you um</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">in the virtue framework uh there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">an opposite but there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">there are two poles of vice right with</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">your values nomenclature</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">what is the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s where i i probably need</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">to update my vocabulary and do some more</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">homework and research</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">um i literally jumped into this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">completely blind so i really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">the feedback for saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">this you know i should probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">look at the model of virtues instead i</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">mean i agree that values is different</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">than virtues because sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">things you value aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">necessarily a virtue so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">if i value time time spent alone</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not a virtue it&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">value and it&#39;s something which i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">spend</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">effort to get but it&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">good value</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">well spending time alone could be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">virtue if you&#39;re an astronomer</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">but it sounds to me like like what manos</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">is trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">is that um a value can be good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">but a virtue just implies that it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">exactly talking about values is a good</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">way to actually look at this</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">the positive connotation to it which</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">value doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">yeah what a virtue can be like a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">uh can be double-edged or verges can</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">hence the golden mean i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">is really useful for the point that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">menace was trying to make sorry</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">yeah i do want to encourage you man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">not meant to be challenging but</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">um like even to work with your</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">maybe the opposite is something called</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">an unvalue i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:23.040" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t nitpicking it just happens to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">be true that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.040" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">morals and virtue ethics are so</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">notoriously fraught</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">well if the op the opposite is something</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;d value is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s worthless for you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">wow there&#39;s i guess there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">the opposite in the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">worthlessness but then there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">this value where you like i val</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">i value for the sake of argument i value</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">but i dis value suffering but i find</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">you know things that make no difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">worthless</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">i think one of the things that i like</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">about the idea of values as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">is that the idea of value has this</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">component of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">that&#39;s about motivation</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">whereas virtue does not virtue is more</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">idealized goal state or embodiment of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">idea not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">the sense of being like</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">motiva it doesn&#39;t have the dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">motivation behind it so it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit removed from</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">um okay i just want to reset the frame</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">context of written or like</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">how do like values seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">personal and thereby irrelevant well</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">well there&#39;s two ways we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">that so so one is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">we could say part of written r would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">cultivating virtue</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">you know for example john&#39;s structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">the dialogues exercise</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">you know the the actual exercise of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">dialogue is to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">uh talking about virtues and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">one of the goals of that is to help</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:05.119" style="s2">promote virtues in our lives in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.119" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">i think what ritner wants to do is help</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:09.839" style="s2">cultiva so that&#39;s cultivating relevance</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.839" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">and and it&#39;s helping us</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">pick the right values the best values</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">the most relevant values</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">to value and that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">by the way what man i think what mannis</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">what one of the words i use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">what i think manus is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">researching is like temperaments so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">like my temperament is very solitary and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">then there&#39;ll be someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">got a temperament where they always want</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">to be with other people</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s just like a temperament</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">but the virtue would be when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">seeing these two temperaments and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">place between them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">like the value is like i i&#39;ve i</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">value um solitude</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">in that sense but then um</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">virtue is more normative right</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">yeah can i pick up on that too sorry</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">after you go ahead that&#39;s right i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">i i did want to feed into that because</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">again it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a midway point which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">uh you were talking about temperament</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">veloskin just now and manus is looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">at temperament</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">and uh there&#39;s there&#39;s someone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">talking about aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure who but as i understood it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">aristotle is calling a virtue a</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">disposition</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">it you know some people call it an</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">excellence and excellence of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">etc etc but it&#39;s also i think in greek</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s hexist</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">which means a disposition which might</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">also be considered a temperament</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">uh just throwing that in there we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">perhaps just move away from discussing</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">and and this is by no means a criticism</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">of the discussion that&#39;s happening it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">very useful and valuable and insightful</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">but i just want to avoid the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">going back</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">and forth on semantics and be clear on</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">the meaning of what was done and i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s why some people were saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">this is what i mean with virgin this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">what you mean with virtue and this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">so so just to make it clear what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">values um is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">um recognizing this process</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">of cultivating virtues right um and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">for for example um something that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">of being human</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">is uh one way of looking at dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">our problems and getting out of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">getting unstuck</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">is becoming aware of let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">example shadow archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">right like ways we behave like for</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">example behaving like a victim</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">or behaving like a child so the victim</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">is like you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">powerless you know i&#39;m i&#39;m the victim of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">something outside of myself right the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">child is uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">not accepting responsibility or or</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">anything like that as an example</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">um so what happens is they&#39;ve got pay</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">payoffs</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">right so uh let&#39;s let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">um i want to use an easy example with</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">the shadow archetype of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">of the idea of the prostitute and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">idea of the procedure to say is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">okay there&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">that isn&#39;t aligned with my values or my</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">integrity or the way i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">prefer to do things in a very you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">with who i see myself as my my values my</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">virtues my identity</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to do but i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">it because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.319" style="s2">uh a practicality or pragmatic side of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">it for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.319" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">um i personally work in an i.t job right</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">but i hate working an i.t job i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">find it meaningful at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">but it pays well right so in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">i&#39;m prostituting myself in that sense as</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">a shadow archetype right</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">now what is the value that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">that for me the value that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s about being responsible</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">financially responsible</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">right but now if i want to get unstuck</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">and i&#39;ll go to the next level and say i</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">want to make a living out</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">by living out of integrity with what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">really do deeply</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">care about and i&#39;m passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the next step so what</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">the idea of values for uh does in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">it helps me build a story from where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">stuck to where i&#39;m going and builds</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">empathy</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">so when two people are having a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">conversation with each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">it can create help create that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">transformation that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">that process and for me that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">mean with well that&#39;s my goal with</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">trying to stick around this world and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">this semantics of values as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">others i hope that&#39;s helpful yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">just to put that in context and first</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">sorry chevron we&#39;re getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">background noise are you able to mute</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">talking yeah no problem um</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">so just to put into the context of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">written r um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">i i think what we should be focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">is okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">you know you have we have that process</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">how do we structure that uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">to help people figure out their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">uh you know their own relevant values</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">and you know like what</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">in the frame of what do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">integrate into written or what do we see</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">as possibly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">being a part of retina rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">getting into the individual examples of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">positive virtues and values and and so</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">can i ask a meta level question and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">point to the present moment and ask what</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">and further the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">what values are you bringing currently</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">my immediate thought is that that&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">the answer to that would be so vast that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">i cannot even</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">begin to answer that feels like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">just so many values operating at once</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not very easy to even say it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">well um why should we listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">velocity</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">let me ask that because i might have a</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">yeah one of the values i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">bring here is to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">written our specific and what what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">get from it rather than you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">staying on topic i guess uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">or in the right frame in context</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">i&#39;m at rats</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">so if we were to stay on topic where did</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">we wind up</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">well the idea is that we don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">probably going to be helpful what i</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">i see these sessions as brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">sessions and uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">of you know you know wisdom the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">getting a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:35.359" style="s2">thrown out and hopefully then narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:39.599" style="s2">them down to the best ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.359" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">and proceeding with that so</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">the values that are discussed and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">either are going be in agreement with</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">what we already have within us</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">or uh disagreement right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">no it&#39;s not about what we have within us</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s an external project right like we</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">you want to facilitate something in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">world right so and and something can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">useful to that facilitation or it cannot</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think it has</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">anything to do with what it might be one</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.839" style="s2">step further though</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re hoping it to be useful in what</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.839" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">for the informing of our actions or our</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">well we&#39;re not there yet like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of building creating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">building blocks to get there though</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">i mean in this specific context in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">moment in this video in this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">um the golden thread i see pulling</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">through is one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">talked about in the video</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">is the theme of self-deception the value</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">and and it&#39;s interesting to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">know as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">as a collective of the participants here</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">it was brought up this idea of talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">about that implements the values the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">and i think how those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">connected for me at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">is to use the idea of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">and recognizing um</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">the mechanics of values and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">how they work</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">as a way to deal with self-deception as</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">a way to get out of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not how most people operate in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">well that&#39;s the point of retinol right</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">provide an alternative to the way most</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">people do things in the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">they can make progress</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">no no no no like people no</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">like people don&#39;t have the capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">you&#39;re requiring from them</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">so if you if you want to build a system</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">on that level</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">that&#39;s just gonna fail i beg to differ i</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">my personal experience um in therapy as</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">a patient</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">is um that&#39;s kind of what happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.240" style="s2">the stepping stone effect</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re really smart and other</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.240" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">people are not that smart</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s built into the process of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">what the therapist is using is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">is giving uh out of a place of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">a place for these different values that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">can come up so instead of a person</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say judged or they feel wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">they feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">they&#39;re missing something or they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">to you know like this artificial side of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">it which will not bring transformation</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this um it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">like building salience in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">transformative process</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">by recognizing through empathy the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">different can i</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">can i for example use the term the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">payoffs that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">uh unhealthy behavior gives and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m doing it and it helps get</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">to the root of an issue</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">and it recognizes a value and then that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">allows processing to shift from being</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">and reciprocal narrowing happening to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:48.559" style="s2">you know being able to get a better</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">handle of those things</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.559" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">and then develop a better tool</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">to transform um and that&#39;s that&#39;s my i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not disagreeing with that process</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">possibilities of the process i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">saying that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">going to work pragmatically</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">guys because we&#39;re not we&#39;re not solving</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:11.520" style="s2">the problems for them</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">we&#39;re giving them the tools so would</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.520" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">that therapy have been as effective</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">if the person had just said all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">here&#39;s all of this information here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">all of these books</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">go and read them and start figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">what your problems are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">what pitfalls you&#39;re falling into and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">figure out for yourself what</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">prop what parasitic processing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">using and figure out for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">how to grade kids</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">creating tools for people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">that won&#39;t happen people don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">i think what are we doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">yeah i just want to say that i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">that perhaps we&#39;re try we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">too narrower view on retina here because</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">the the idea that we&#39;re solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">or trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">to cope with problems and everything or</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">you know trying to build a toolkit to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">cope with problems it&#39;s all great but</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not hearing any communities in any</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">of that and if britain or isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">affording communities and i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">what it&#39;s what good it&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">and so i think um</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">at least something of what manus is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">talking about they will have to come</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">in to the retina project if it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">to be able to build communities</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">oh remember we haven&#39;t been talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">about we haven&#39;t been doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">written our writ large here we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">like there was some specific things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">came out of that video such as</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">reducing self-deception you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">controlling for bias</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of uh you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.400" style="s2">you know cultivating virtue we that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">why i think the focus has been on</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.400" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">tools for that rather than communitas</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">i mean maybe there are elements of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">in community tasks but but</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">but i think we&#39;ve been talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">bit of a narrow focus i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">saying and fair enough but</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">um just because we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">video doesn&#39;t mean that we can just</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">ignore everything that we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">achieve and then shoot down</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">good ideas and say that they&#39;re bad</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re not dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">little one aspect that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">deal with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">because of the video that&#39;s my point no</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">no sure i was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not a fault that we&#39;re narrowing in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">on these tools right now because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">i think that that&#39;s what&#39;s most relevant</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">to the issues that we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">i mean yeah i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">know problem with any of that and i i</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">applaud it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">as i said um i&#39;m just saying that like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">the criticism that manus is receiving</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">isn&#39;t justified because i&#39;m i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">hearing anything about the communities</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">and we shouldn&#39;t overlook that when</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about well</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">what are we trying to do with written on</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">you know like what are we trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">value when we</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">when we come into the retinal</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">discussion because as i say communitize</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">is definitely one of my values</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">for sure yes and in the spirit of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">steward</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">steward or strawn i prefer stream</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:01.119" style="s2">thanks drew in the spirit of that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">being completely open i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.119" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">i think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">religion that is not a religion i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">rookie</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a perspective within the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">communitas of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">in terms of a frequency some some people</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">are really deep into it</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">i&#39;m just interested you know i</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly where i stand so that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">there&#39;s an open space as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">something there as well thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">yeah no and i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">perspective though i think for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">these sort of committee type meetings i</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">just take you know unless we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">have a a talk on just is written our</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:48.480" style="s2">good in itself is just start from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">assumption that yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make a go of written r</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">or at least explore it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">and and and go from there</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">like like like it&#39;s easy in these</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">conversations to get up on these general</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">topics of just what is virtue and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">it values but</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">you know maybe i&#39;ll just bring it out to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">the group do we want to really just</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">focus these meetings on</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">sort of much more pragmatic what would</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">what would we specifically do what can</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">we imagine doing in a retina</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">specifically for these</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">i things i prefer that level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">conversation as well brett</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">something that could result in action</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">not necessarily but you know small</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">enough stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">that if we decided to take an action</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">then we could</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">maybe we maybe we need to restructure a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">little bit and have</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">one discussion you know macro</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">level and then play around with</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">lower levels then back to macro over and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">over again well</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">change scales back and forth we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">the presence of other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">um this is a bit of a community</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">in the moment is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">satisfying everyone&#39;s desire to be in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">communitas</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">if not what is missing</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not the purpose to be in</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">communities like let&#39;s please get off</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">that train like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">we&#39;re here to have a meeting and a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">meeting is not for communities right we</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">can have a different event</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">and then we can have communities in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">event like</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">or or rather it like this meeting itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">is not communitas</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">though we can talk about how in written</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">are we would cultivate humanitas</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">right so sure sure right yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">topic yes i agree well that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">not the the latter not the former</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">right i think in general any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">stated goal for this meeting would have</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">helped me</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">this is my first time um i enjoy being</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">listened and participate but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">quite sure how yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">well um the the proposal that i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.359" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">going to make is that if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">watch a video every other week</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">then the discussions in the in between</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">weeks can be the more general ones and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">then we can try and use the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">videos</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">on a weekly basis to try and pick out</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">more specific things that we can then</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">comb over to collect for the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">general conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">by general do you mean less focused or</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">overarching yeah well i mean people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">trying to figure out now you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">how do we approach written or how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">talk about written or what what should</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">be on the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">you know how do we arrange this all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">those kinds of questions so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">presumably if we have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">over a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll start to make progress right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;ll start to form up written or in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">more general sense or at least we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">an idea of how we want to work together</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">to accomplish that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">and so if we have that general</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">discussion and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">every other week we have the videos then</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">we can use the videos as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">you know we can kind of mine the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">whatever viveki said</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">to use as inspiration for the more</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">general conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">then then we&#39;ve got the high level and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:20.240" style="s2">the low level or the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">the details level in the general level</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">um kind of playing together with each</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">other in a way that i think could work</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">so i i just want to make a suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">right like if</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">if people want to like focus on one</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">specific part</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">then they can just choose to meet up</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">right they can make</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">an event and they can invite people so i</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">encourage people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">and it is it is good to get that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">knowledge back into a bigger group</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">at a specific point so i&#39;m i&#39;m in total</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">agreement here</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">yeah i was thinking about a similar line</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">sorry that we could have with</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">the you know committee and we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">subcommittees you know subgroups within</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">the committees who are working on</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">specific projects and then they can come</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">back and report to the larger committee</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">and you know people can be part of as</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">many subgroups as they want</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">but we could have focused</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">focus uh are there agenda items</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">well does anyone have agenda items</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">i mean what we&#39;ve we&#39;re doing is uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll come up with a project</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">that we may wish to have done usually i</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">i assume mostly</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">that will happen in these discussions</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">and then someone can step up if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">interested to take it on</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">and then in so this week is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">video week and then next week is like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">homework week</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">where we bring back what we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">thought about and researched</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">on our little self-taken project</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">i have just a general question i mean is</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">it safe to assume to everyone that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s everybody&#39;s goal to create written</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">art and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">promote it and have it live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">is that the shared purpose of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">on the call</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s certainly the goal of you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">the written our</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">interested people yeah it may not be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">goal of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">in here but that&#39;s why we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">for the purposes of these meetings it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">should be the assumed goal</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">and and again i think under the under</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">the assumption that we know</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">we have no idea if it&#39;ll work or not but</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">i think we</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">the people here believe it&#39;s the people</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">who really want to get involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">believe it&#39;s a worthwhile project</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">and want to give it a good it&#39;s good a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">shot as the as it can of working</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s sort of the that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">should be the one the motif for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">motivation the the primary assumption</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">that we just start from</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">for for these particular things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">thanks for clarifying that because</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">just coming in um maybe this is useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">feedback but i wasn&#39;t sure if</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">this is more of just an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">pursuit you know part of the larger</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">understanding of all this material</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">versus maybe more of a pragmatic attempt</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">at making something really happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">world and i think we can have</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">meetings you know we could have we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">have discussions like you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.559" end="00:59:12.799" style="s2">discussed like hey what&#39;s the point of</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">written r</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.799" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">is it a good idea but i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">separate from from this type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">the other thing we can do and this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been thinking of is you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">maybe appointing a chair of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">committee and other committees that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to form</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">and the chair can and the chair can</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">maybe work with the people and take</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">advice</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">and then create a an agenda each week</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">for these</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">for these meetings so so it can have</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">sort of a specific focus</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">what do you guys think of that idea yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">i&#39;d like to answer by still mending two</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">things quickly</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">if you might allow me my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">is that the agenda for today&#39;s meeting</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:51.760" style="s2">was to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">to make notes off from the video and to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.760" end="00:59:53.920" style="s2">see what we can get out of that for</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.920" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">working projects or you know sharing</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">insights of what we got out of the video</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">so that was for me very clear and i also</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">want to steal man</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:04.240" style="s2">i think it was joel that mentioned about</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.240" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">just the um intellectual discussion</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.280" style="s2">versus maybe practical things later on</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">um and just to make sure they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:14.559" style="s2">understand correctly</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:16.799" style="s2">asking about not just let&#39;s say figuring</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.559" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">stuff out understanding it but also</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.799" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">creating something doing something</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">that&#39;s applicable that&#39;s actionable</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">is is that my understanding of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">question you are asking</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">in other words let&#39;s say if we develop a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">tool that is useful for</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">people that would be a practical as</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">opposed to only intellectual discussion</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:36.720" style="s2">yeah or even to take it to like an</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">extreme let&#39;s say that there was</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.720" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">uh already a solution out there is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">the same group of people that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:45.599" style="s2">uh are so motivated they would you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">clean the toilets and mop the floors to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.599" end="01:00:48.240" style="s2">put it out there or is this the group</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">that would like to stay more into</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.240" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">intellectual realm and be contributed to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">the idea space of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">in other words the framing of retinol</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">right there</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">i think it&#39;s more that we i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">more a question about the way i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">listening to people</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">speak to these topics um sounds as</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">they already spend time thinking in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:16.160" style="s2">space so their contribution would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">considered um idea contribution or</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.160" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">you know there&#39;s like i&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">this is like an altruistic group of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">people do whatever it takes you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">or they&#39;ll do what it takes within their</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">wheelhouse i guess</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">so i think i can you go first all right</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.839" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">yeah i think that um this will be</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">slightly more theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:37.680" style="s2">along those along the lines that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.680" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">but what we&#39;re doing here isn&#39;t the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">thing that the server is doing there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">lots of other</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:45.760" style="s2">practical projects that are ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">where people are actually trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.760" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">practice put the stuff into practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">so you get both but the emphasis i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">you will find most people would be more</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:55.520" style="s2">interested in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:56.799" style="s2">in the idea space but the idea is i</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.520" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">think to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.799" end="01:01:59.920" style="s2">work with the ideas in such a way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">we can develop practices which and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.920" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">you would see</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">in in other places not necessarily in</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">the written eye discussion anymore</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">yeah so i think i i want to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">recon orient everyone who&#39;s here and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:20.799" style="s2">so we determined in the first discussion</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">that we were having troubles</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.799" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">with retina so we had the um</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:27.680" style="s2">voice disc discussion right and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">determined that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.680" end="01:02:31.599" style="s2">problem formulation was the most</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">important thing we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.599" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s what john has</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.359" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">said himself so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is meeting up to try and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">i guess for now is to determine</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">what perennial problems or</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">problems we&#39;re actually trying to solve</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">like what&#39;s the purpose of retina</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">exactly and that seems like an</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">inherently</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">kind of intellectual endeavor i suppose</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">so that that that&#39;s we&#39;re setting up</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">this sort of very general framework</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re kind of building down into</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">uh what what&#39;s going to be a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.839" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.319" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">and that helps a lot so i think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a principle here i&#39;m identifying</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">that is that there won&#39;t be like an</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">orchestration of existing tools and</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">technologies that emerge</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">into written r the idea is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">some first principles</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:31.680" style="s2">that may be kind of pushed down to well</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:34.079" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.680" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">an emergent written r from those almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.079" end="01:03:40.720" style="s2">ab initio creation of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:40.720" style="s2">well i mean honestly i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.680" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">sorry to interrupt um i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.079" end="01:03:49.039" style="s2">actually say that if that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">is the case uh like i&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.039" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">then i would like to help change that to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">incorporate cooperate things that might</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">be useful and valuable like for example</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:58.400" style="s2">one of the basic ideas of the awakening</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">from the meaning crisis series is</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.400" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">to make use of the existing psycho</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:05.359" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">right and move away from the problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:10.640" style="s2">dogma for example right of old ways of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:12.720" style="s2">thinking so definitely about</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.640" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">i think using what what exists and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.720" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">what&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">um i hope i&#39;m understanding</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:21.200" style="s2">that right from my point of view on on</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">redneck&#39;s intention</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.200" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">yeah so what we&#39;re what we determined as</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:28.079" style="s2">often said</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">the first discussion was um we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.079" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">have a full</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">um idea of what problem we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:35.200" style="s2">solve with retina</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just one problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.200" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of other problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">so what we&#39;re doing is first of all</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at formulating the problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">and getting a clear understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">what problem we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">at that point we&#39;ll say okay so what</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">existing psychotechnologies do we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">that can help solve this problem and</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:55.599" style="s2">okay what</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">rituals do we already have that to help</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.599" end="01:04:58.319" style="s2">solve this problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2">and what kind of things do we need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.319" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">create still so</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.920" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">um if you think about it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:06.799" style="s2">multi-step project</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">the first step is um basically if you if</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.799" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">you think about when you get a group</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:11.119" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2">when you&#39;re assigned a group project in</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.119" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">a class um and you&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">this is what you need to do we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:18.880" style="s2">have the this is what we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:21.119" style="s2">so we&#39;re getting that this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.880" end="01:05:24.400" style="s2">need to do and then we&#39;re taking that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">and using those aspects to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.400" end="01:05:27.280" style="s2">okay how do we do this what needs doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">what needs</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.280" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">creating what do we already have</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">and just to point out what someone also</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">mentioned in the rest of the server</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff going on where</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">putting psychotechnologies into practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">and experimenting with rituals</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got the meditate</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:47.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:49.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve started with yoga in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.119" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">and meditation following john&#39;s course</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.599" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">through the wisdom of hypatia now uh we</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve been experimenting with lectio</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:59.359" style="s2">divina</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:06:00.480" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re going to be moving into uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.359" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">dear logos</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.480" end="01:06:05.359" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got a lot of uh we&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">of things going on</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.359" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">where we&#39;re we&#39;re playing with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">serious play of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">of the psycho technologies for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">that john and others have</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">have mentioned and uh so</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:20.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of practical stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">going on too so i encourage everyone to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.240" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">to participate in in those because i</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:27.200" style="s2">think those the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">has got to be i think at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.200" end="01:06:31.440" style="s2">practical written art</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">and you know like so so in some respects</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.440" end="01:06:34.079" style="s2">i see</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">the activities going on the discord as</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.079" end="01:06:37.440" style="s2">written are like</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">at least a proto-typical written art</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.440" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.720" style="s2">we&#39;re doing we have a sense of how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">going to come together brett</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.720" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">like what happens when manuel and i</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">disagree like</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">strongly on a topic are we going to arm</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:52.160" style="s2">wrestle it out or</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:53.839" style="s2">how does this community go the great the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:55.920" style="s2">great thing about</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.839" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">yeah the great thing about the approach</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.920" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:01.039" style="s2">to this and to the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:03.599" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.039" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">there isn&#39;t it&#39;s not a dogmatic approach</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.599" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">we want to identify</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">psychotechnologies that afford certain</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">you know cultivatory goals</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.839" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">and we don&#39;t all have to agree on this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">this is the one this is the right one so</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">for example there&#39;s a billion different</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:26.799" style="s2">meditation practices you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">doing a meditation practice and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.799" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:31.119" style="s2">a particular school that&#39;s that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to follow</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">john&#39;s course or or the other course you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:38.000" style="s2">probably we want to have some agreement</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">you know on</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">you know writ large that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.160" style="s2">you know get better at rel relevance</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">realization but</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.160" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">but we can have different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">achieving that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">not a bad thing and then hopefully we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">figure out over time what</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">what the which techniques psycho</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">technologies are better and which are</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">which are not as effective and and some</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:01.760" style="s2">might be effective for some people and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">not for others</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.760" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">i&#39;m actually do that get at your</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:11.200" style="s2">i actually this all helps so much um i</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.400" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">i haven&#39;t what i&#39;m hearing or maybe what</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.200" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve been proposing even i guess</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">um from listening to john vervicky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">series so far i&#39;m about three quarters</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">of the way through</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:22.319" style="s2">uh there&#39;s so many lessons of where</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:24.960" style="s2">things go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.319" end="01:08:26.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m almost wondering if this group</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">would be almost like uh trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.319" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">establish a criterion by which you could</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">just discriminate</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">what should not be written are or where</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">it might be perhaps a missing</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">point or um missing a critical dimension</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">something like this i like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">formulation that&#39;s a good orientation</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">welcome phil</p>

<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">very large questions with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.120" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">what product it is that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">try to create here at the end of all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">this discussion</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">of going further and further into this</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:22.719" style="s2">meta discussion of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:25.040" style="s2">when that&#39;s probably appropriate for</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.719" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">next week</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.040" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">do we want to return to the video</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">it seems that&#39;s like the purpose of this</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.839" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">like is anyone the video is the purpose</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.640" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">i didn&#39;t really have a really strict</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:03.760" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in this channel so i</p>

<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">social structures or whatever right but</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.719" end="01:11:00.640" style="s2">you need to do it at the right</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">level right you cannot you cannot do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a different different set of</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">questions oh yeah this is uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">not about the video so can we yeah sure</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">right i just wanted to clear up</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:20.080" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m just gonna put this back on</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.080" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">put us back on track myself i thought</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">that there was a really deep relevance</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">to the to the chessboard analogy</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">that john described where</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">um so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:40.159" style="s2">this problem that you&#39;re meant to solve</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">which is whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.159" end="01:11:45.040" style="s2">you know you can put the dominoes on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:47.280" style="s2">chessboard and cover every square</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.040" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">without you know having a domino hang</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.280" end="01:11:51.760" style="s2">over the edge</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">but the way to solve it isn&#39;t to just</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.760" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">brute force it but you&#39;ve kind of got to</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">back and then start thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.400" end="01:12:06.239" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how to put it has anyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">got any sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.239" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">thoughts transframing it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">like it is yeah if you think about it in</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">terms of the even and the odds</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:23.360" style="s2">or the you know that there&#39;s equal</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">number of blacks and whites on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.360" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">on the board yeah so you&#39;re just seeing</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:28.560" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:30.000" style="s2">the same problem in a different frame</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.560" end="01:12:31.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s only that way that you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.000" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">easily come with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.280" end="01:12:34.719" style="s2">the solution because the other solution</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">is combinatorially</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.719" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">too explosive like our best computers</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t know would take years doing it</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.320" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">i found that frame that example really</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">useful uh as uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:54.560" style="s2">in what feels like is happening in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.040" end="01:12:56.400" style="s2">academy a lot today that you have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.560" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">of momentum around approaches to ways to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:13:00.239" style="s2">solve complex problems</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:13:01.840" style="s2">you know in the sciences and that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.239" end="01:13:04.000" style="s2">might have this other frame but when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">present that other frame</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.000" end="01:13:07.199" style="s2">it might be considered naive if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:09.280" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.199" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">complex and machined kind of and i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.280" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">point to feel into in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">what it would take to these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">shifts in perspective to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">better sense making</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">yeah i was like um i thought like sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">of sort of taking</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:31.760" style="s2">that or mental orientation</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:33.760" style="s2">might actually be really helpful for</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.760" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">root now if indeed we&#39;re not already</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.760" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">doing it because i&#39;m not sure we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">already doing it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">well yeah because i think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:41.679" style="s2">things john has said about that is you</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">can&#39;t just tell people think outside the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.679" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">box</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.400" end="01:13:48.239" style="s2">that apparently doesn&#39;t work uh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:48.960" style="s2">you have to get them better at shifting</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.239" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.960" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">better at zooming in and zooming out</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">i wonder if you actually ask them</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">instead of saying think outside the box</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">we said</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:04.480" style="s2">where is the box if that might actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">not be more useful in helping people to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.480" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">get the solution</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">sorry we&#39;ll just just to clarify we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">talking about the nine dot problem if</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:13.199" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any idea what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.199" end="01:14:16.400" style="s2">about i was actually just listening to</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:18.400" style="s2">episode</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.400" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">i&#39;m pulling up my spotify right now</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.400" end="01:14:20.560" style="s2">seven or eight or something i&#39;ll know in</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">a second</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.560" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">and um he was talking about something at</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">least related to this</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:28.080" style="s2">where he&#39;s saying um that instruction</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.080" end="01:14:35.120" style="s2">harsh and also instruction that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.520" end="01:14:35.120" style="s2">ambiguous or both not useful</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.679" end="01:14:39.520" style="s2">there is some insight research that has</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">shown that and i can</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.520" end="01:14:42.560" style="s2">put references in the discussion later i</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">have to look it up</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.560" end="01:14:46.080" style="s2">but that do show that there are a</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">quality of problems or you can teach the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.080" end="01:14:49.920" style="s2">the quality of move it takes to think</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">outside the mop the box they can teach</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.920" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:57.840" style="s2">through a kind of meta process which i</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:15:01.280" style="s2">think is really helpful</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.840" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">that sounds extremely useful to us</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.280" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">because we would definitely want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:09.120" style="s2">incorporate that into right now</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:11.920" style="s2">well um from speaking from memory john</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.120" end="01:15:14.000" style="s2">mentioned there was that used</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.920" end="01:15:15.199" style="s2">transcranial magnetic stimulation or</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.199" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">and they could actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.800" end="01:15:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s like a left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.159" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">to the right hemisphere switch when</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.400" end="01:15:26.239" style="s2">insight occurs and they were using the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">the magnets to basically stimulate the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.239" end="01:15:29.040" style="s2">same parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">and when they did that i think you said</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:33.040" style="s2">the the solution to the mind problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:33.520" style="s2">went from like zero to something like 25</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:37.280" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.520" end="01:15:39.199" style="s2">or something crazy so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.280" end="01:15:41.040" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s definitely something along</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.199" end="01:15:43.760" style="s2">those lines that we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.040" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">can use in in the form of tron what is</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">the transcript</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">transform magnetic stimulation</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.320" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">basically they apply strong magnets to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">your brain so you&#39;re saying we should</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:56.320" style="s2">just take magnets and just put it in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">head all the time</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.320" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s probably micro technology</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">yours for only 99.99</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.640" end="01:16:13.310" style="s2">murphy&#39;s laws of combat if it&#39;s stupid</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.520" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">but it works it isn&#39;t stupid</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.310" end="01:16:19.199" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:21.360" style="s2">so we basically hook people up to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.199" end="01:16:23.199" style="s2">trans training stimulation machine</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.360" end="01:16:25.280" style="s2">and then we go okay think about one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.199" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">your problems and then we just</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.280" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">stimulate them no no yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.159" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">i guess we&#39;ve just got our ecology</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">practices now</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.450" end="01:16:45.630" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">who was talking about it beforehand yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:53.679" style="s2">i&#39;ll post that i&#39;ll post that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">discussion fred</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.679" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:08.239" style="s2">so so so velocity so so just to guide us</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">in how you wanted to take about this</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.239" end="01:17:11.600" style="s2">discussion so</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:12.800" style="s2">we have this issue you know of</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.600" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">transframing</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.800" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">and the you know whether it&#39;s a nine dot</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:19.679" style="s2">problem or the checkerboard</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">the chessboard problem how how should we</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.679" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">deal with that in this meeting</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.080" end="01:17:29.040" style="s2">see that&#39;s the thing i don&#39;t know it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.880" end="01:17:31.440" style="s2">just it</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.040" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">it occurred to me like the way that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.440" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">because it feels like a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:38.880" style="s2">even when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:41.120" style="s2">actually problem formulating if</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.880" end="01:17:42.800" style="s2">i get the sense even i am just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.120" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">butting my head against the problem a</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.800" end="01:17:45.679" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">because there is a combinatorially</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.679" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">infinite number of ways</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.880" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">like to approach the problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:56.880" style="s2">and we couldn&#39;t possibly test them all</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">so but take taking that step back</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.880" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">and looking at like what&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.920" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">moving parts i guess obviously</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.120" end="01:18:09.199" style="s2">you know the analogy doesn&#39;t involve</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">moving parts but it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.199" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">because i would never think to look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">that i would never think to look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:15.760" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.679" end="01:18:17.440" style="s2">but there is kind of a mindset in which</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">i would</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.440" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">if i knew to take guitar yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.679" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">because that pattern of every domino</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.159" end="01:18:38.719" style="s2">covers a black and a white square</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t like that doesn&#39;t appear</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.719" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">relevant at first</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">i think i think that the important part</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">to this is um to bring out the uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">algorithmic thinking and if you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.840" end="01:18:53.679" style="s2">to me there&#39;s like a self-felt sense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">algorithmic thinking if i imagine doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.679" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:57.760" style="s2">problem myself that way versus the</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:18:59.600" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.760" end="01:19:01.360" style="s2">almost mind muscle i would sense into</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">where i was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.360" end="01:19:05.360" style="s2">find an insight to a different way to</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.960" end="01:19:05.360" style="s2">solve it</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.480" end="01:19:10.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s the issue that we&#39;re zeroing in</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:13.840" style="s2">on that that getting better</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.320" end="01:19:15.280" style="s2">at breaking frame and finding the</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.840" end="01:19:15.920" style="s2">relevant frame is something we want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.280" end="01:19:18.719" style="s2">cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.920" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">with written r is that our goal right</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.719" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">just for for this meeting just</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:25.199" style="s2">identifying that as the issue</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">no i was just sort of raising that idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.199" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">yeah so i i would i would</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.080" end="01:19:34.880" style="s2">assert as a rule in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:36.560" style="s2">right where you first have to justify</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.880" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">the relevance of your frame</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.560" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">before you can adopt it</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.480" end="01:19:46.719" style="s2">and then at least we we</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.600" end="01:19:48.239" style="s2">keep back to the tangents because i</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.719" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.239" end="01:19:53.440" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much an issue of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.440" end="01:19:55.040" style="s2">getting in the wrong frames getting lost</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.440" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">in the rabbit hole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.040" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">the evil two</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.440" end="01:20:02.560" style="s2">so what would that look like are you</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:05.360" style="s2">speaking to my comments do you want me</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.560" end="01:20:07.840" style="s2">to speak to the relevance of my comment</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.360" end="01:20:08.719" style="s2">no no no i&#39;m i&#39;m just saying this as as</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.840" end="01:20:11.520" style="s2">a rule right</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.719" end="01:20:13.360" style="s2">if we want to improve the way this</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.520" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">conversation goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.360" end="01:20:16.639" style="s2">or written our conversations in general</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:20.400" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s useful to justify</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:24.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re what you&#39;re planning to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.480" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">so that everybody&#39;s on the same page and</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.880" end="01:20:29.199" style="s2">then we can first discuss the relevance</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:29.600" style="s2">of the thing you&#39;re trying to do before</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.199" end="01:20:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.600" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">lay out the whole plan</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.440" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not opposed to that in principle i</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.440" end="01:20:46.880" style="s2">think some people may</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.800" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">balk at speaking if</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.880" end="01:20:50.239" style="s2">they have to give that type of</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">justification um</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.239" end="01:20:57.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s a pro and con uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:59.040" style="s2">situation there do it if you can like do</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.280" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">it if you can i suppose</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t want to bar people from</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:08.080" style="s2">introducing their ideas but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.840" end="01:21:11.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like an intention more so than</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:11.120" style="s2">yeah setting the intention</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.199" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">well what is what is your intention</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.960" end="01:21:18.960" style="s2">reframing for that statement</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:21.600" style="s2">well so so what i see in this</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:22.080" style="s2">conversation right there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.600" end="01:21:24.639" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.080" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">humbling about from left to right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.639" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:28.560" style="s2">what i want to do is be productive right</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:30.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.560" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">want to have a sense that we accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.320" end="01:21:33.600" style="s2">something here and that we have all</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:36.080" style="s2">learned something and</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.600" end="01:21:37.679" style="s2">that therefore you need optimization and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.080" end="01:21:41.600" style="s2">this is i think a way</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.679" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">to have uh fruitful optimization</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.600" end="01:21:45.040" style="s2">do you think that everyone is making the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:48.239" style="s2">same assessment as yourself with regards</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.040" end="01:21:48.239" style="s2">to the value of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.920" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">well i think he&#39;s proposing that i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.080" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">he&#39;s proposing that as</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">as a value we should adopt for the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">conversation and he&#39;s putting that on</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:21:59.679" style="s2">the table</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.840" end="01:22:00.880" style="s2">no no i mean i&#39;m asking him directly</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.679" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.880" end="01:22:05.199" style="s2">his uh assessment of the overall</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.840" end="01:22:07.679" style="s2">productivity</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.199" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">it it seems i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.679" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">grant that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">i did i didn&#39;t make an assessment i said</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:16.960" style="s2">i made a proposal for an optimization</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.159" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m saying that things can be</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.960" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">better and if someone is going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.159" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">disagree with that then</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.600" end="01:22:26.480" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.639" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">know how you&#39;d have to allow for</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.480" end="01:22:31.360" style="s2">disagreement right i mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:34.080" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m not i&#39;m not for closing on</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.360" end="01:22:34.080" style="s2">this agreement</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:37.600" style="s2">and i also said it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">intention-setting thing it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.600" end="01:22:43.360" style="s2">absolute rule because absolute rules are</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">sure so i would say if you&#39;re optimizing</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.360" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">for insight</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:55.440" style="s2">jail i&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">talking but we can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">i&#39;m the internet hater it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.080" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">yeah and i was just raising the question</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.080" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">of like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:10.800" style="s2">and it probably merits spending a little</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:12.239" style="s2">bit of time on just figuring out how we</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.800" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">and i think you have i&#39;m sorry i missed</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.239" end="01:23:14.639" style="s2">the first two meetings but just how do</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.080" end="01:23:16.480" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.639" end="01:23:18.080" style="s2">how do we want to approach these like if</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.480" end="01:23:20.080" style="s2">we&#39;re going through a video</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.080" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">how do we want to approach it is it just</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.080" end="01:23:22.719" style="s2">identifying so we&#39;ve identified for</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:24.480" style="s2">example now</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.719" end="01:23:26.880" style="s2">the issue of transframing and breaking</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.480" end="01:23:29.120" style="s2">frame and getting better at</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.880" end="01:23:30.000" style="s2">switching frames and identifying what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.120" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.000" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">is that as far as we want to go and now</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:35.679" style="s2">we move on to</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.360" end="01:23:36.480" style="s2">the next part or do we want to explore</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.679" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.480" end="01:23:40.159" style="s2">for example how we would do that how do</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:43.440" style="s2">we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.159" end="01:23:49.840" style="s2">we can do how do we want to approach</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.440" end="01:23:49.840" style="s2">this in this type of meeting</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:24:01.520" style="s2">all right my suggestion would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.199" end="01:24:02.320" style="s2">start off by talking about the video and</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.520" end="01:24:05.040" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.320" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">physics alien points and then trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.040" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">tie those points back to root now and</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">tying them into okay how does this</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">relate to</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:14.880" style="s2">this part of the project how does it</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.639" end="01:24:17.760" style="s2">relate to that part of the project</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.880" end="01:24:18.960" style="s2">uh and then if there are any um new</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.760" end="01:24:20.880" style="s2">projects that arise</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.960" end="01:24:22.800" style="s2">based on the video and based on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.880" end="01:24:25.040" style="s2">discussion then looking</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.800" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">for okay is this part of another</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.040" end="01:24:28.320" style="s2">existing project or</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">is this a new project and if so who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.320" end="01:24:34.239" style="s2">willing to take it on</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:36.239" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.239" end="01:24:38.000" style="s2">yeah what i was going to say was that i</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.239" end="01:24:41.760" style="s2">think everybody will have their</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.000" end="01:24:44.239" style="s2">their own um ideas with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">what&#39;s important in the in the videos</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.239" end="01:24:46.960" style="s2">and so the idea was that people could</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:48.480" style="s2">just take notes and then they would</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.960" end="01:24:52.639" style="s2">bring they would share their notes</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.480" end="01:24:52.639" style="s2">for discussion yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.080" end="01:25:00.880" style="s2">but you know what exactly the the no</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">cheering was supposed to achieve i guess</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.880" end="01:25:07.520" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t considered well yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:08.880" style="s2">the the idea was that we share notes</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.520" end="01:25:11.520" style="s2">we&#39;re all going to notice different</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.880" end="01:25:14.560" style="s2">information by sharing</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.520" end="01:25:15.120" style="s2">we&#39;re probably going to you know get a</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.560" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.120" end="01:25:19.600" style="s2">more full sense of what what the video</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:22.320" style="s2">can offer</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.600" end="01:25:23.199" style="s2">and then because we&#39;ve recorded it we</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.320" end="01:25:26.239" style="s2">can then take</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.199" end="01:25:29.040" style="s2">notes and make it more permanent</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.239" end="01:25:31.840" style="s2">on paper and then put it in the retina</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.040" end="01:25:33.360" style="s2">document or something</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.840" end="01:25:35.040" style="s2">i have to admit though it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.360" end="01:25:36.480" style="s2">kind of difficult to take notes of these</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.040" end="01:25:39.280" style="s2">videos because</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.480" end="01:25:40.320" style="s2">um you know in many cases john is saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.280" end="01:25:42.159" style="s2">the same things</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.320" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">to different audiences and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.159" end="01:25:45.120" style="s2">lot of repetition</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">and so you actually get used to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.120" end="01:25:48.080" style="s2">the things that have been said and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.080" end="01:25:52.080" style="s2">notice them or think about them you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:54.400" style="s2">to take notes</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.080" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">like i watched the whole video but i</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.400" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">ended up not wanting to write anything</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:25:58.560" style="s2">down because i was like well</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:00.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve dealt with all of this you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.560" end="01:26:02.400" style="s2">what is there really to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.400" end="01:26:03.760" style="s2">and i don&#39;t i&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.400" end="01:26:05.120" style="s2">right attitude that you should have</p>

<p begin="01:26:05.120" end="01:26:09.520" style="s2">if the you know the more familiar</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.280" end="01:26:12.239" style="s2">retinal people will</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.520" end="01:26:14.719" style="s2">have that experience i don&#39;t know but um</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.239" end="01:26:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an unlikely possibility i guess</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.719" end="01:26:18.159" style="s2">i definitely had some trouble putting</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.600" end="01:26:21.040" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.159" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">worthwhile notes but i guess this is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.040" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">value of the noobs</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:27.440" style="s2">the newbies because they&#39;ll they&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:30.000" style="s2">it more freshly</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.440" end="01:26:31.679" style="s2">yeah and come to think of it um if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.000" end="01:26:33.920" style="s2">looking at the playlist i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.679" end="01:26:35.760" style="s2">going to be very different</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.920" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">because that was a talk right the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.760" end="01:26:39.920" style="s2">video was a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:41.679" style="s2">so i think the conversations will will</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.920" end="01:26:43.199" style="s2">actually be easier for note-taking</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.679" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">relative to the talks</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.199" end="01:26:46.480" style="s2">we might even want to maybe just you</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.800" end="01:26:47.679" style="s2">know like look at the list and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.480" end="01:26:49.120" style="s2">consider beforehand</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.679" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">whether or not the video is even worth</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.120" end="01:26:51.920" style="s2">considering uh worth talking about in</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.920" end="01:26:55.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i want to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:57.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.199" end="01:26:58.639" style="s2">but then well i guess the question is</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.120" end="01:27:00.320" style="s2">how do we go about doing that quality</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.639" end="01:27:04.719" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.320" end="01:27:07.679" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s fine just to go with</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.719" end="01:27:08.880" style="s2">let&#39;s just go with conversations rather</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.679" end="01:27:10.960" style="s2">than lectures</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.880" end="01:27:12.480" style="s2">because i would bet that lectures are</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.960" end="01:27:14.080" style="s2">probably generally just going to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.480" end="01:27:17.280" style="s2">giving us</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.080" end="01:27:18.320" style="s2">you know general stuff what we already</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.280" end="01:27:21.920" style="s2">heard in other words</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.320" end="01:27:23.600" style="s2">yeah yeah i think that&#39;s a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.920" end="01:27:32.000" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.600" end="01:27:34.480" style="s2">anybody else got some ideas</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.000" end="01:27:37.199" style="s2">and of course anybody else got any notes</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.480" end="01:27:37.199" style="s2">they want to share</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.280" end="01:27:40.000" style="s2">if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.560" end="01:27:47.040" style="s2">i didn&#39;t do notes for this week but but</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:48.719" style="s2">i i will in the future</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.040" end="01:27:50.400" style="s2">well i mean we have been at this for 90</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.719" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">minutes so you know um</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.400" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">the entire video was only an hour</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.440" end="01:28:01.040" style="s2">so yeah like what i might propose and</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.880" end="01:28:02.159" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be in in this time</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.040" end="01:28:05.360" style="s2">slot</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.159" end="01:28:08.320" style="s2">to instead of watching this stuff alone</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.360" end="01:28:09.600" style="s2">in preparation organize a watching party</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.320" end="01:28:11.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.600" end="01:28:14.880" style="s2">then you can just discuss it and take</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.760" end="01:28:14.880" style="s2">notes together like it</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.600" end="01:28:26.080" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do that but i like</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.560" end="01:28:28.400" style="s2">the idea of us</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.080" end="01:28:30.159" style="s2">being able to mull it over a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.400" end="01:28:32.080" style="s2">for a few days before we</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.159" end="01:28:34.480" style="s2">discuss it because we can there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.080" end="01:28:35.760" style="s2">relevant ways things connect right</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.480" end="01:28:38.639" style="s2">that you&#39;re not going to be able to just</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.760" end="01:28:40.320" style="s2">come up with on the spot</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.639" end="01:28:42.159" style="s2">what about you could have a watch party</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.320" end="01:28:43.760" style="s2">before the conversation and then yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.159" end="01:28:46.080" style="s2">split those up</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.760" end="01:28:47.840" style="s2">well also yeah there&#39;s nothing saying</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.080" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t have watched it a few days</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.840" end="01:28:51.840" style="s2">before the watch party yeah right the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:52.960" style="s2">watch party doesn&#39;t have to be a fresh</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.840" end="01:28:55.360" style="s2">watch</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.960" end="01:28:56.080" style="s2">it could be just a the platform for</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.360" end="01:28:59.360" style="s2">bringing everything</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.080" end="01:29:00.000" style="s2">up uh so watching these videos more than</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.360" end="01:29:02.480" style="s2">once is</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.000" end="01:29:03.440" style="s2">not a bad idea in any event so you can</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.480" end="01:29:06.560" style="s2">do your yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.440" end="01:29:08.719" style="s2">and and you can have you can have</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:10.080" style="s2">all all the talk right like getting up</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.719" end="01:29:12.239" style="s2">to date on what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.080" end="01:29:13.440" style="s2">on around it right you can pause the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.239" end="01:29:15.920" style="s2">video and discuss</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.440" end="01:29:16.960" style="s2">things in between all that stuff is is</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.920" end="01:29:20.159" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.960" end="01:29:22.960" style="s2">and then we we can segregate certain</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.159" end="01:29:25.199" style="s2">types of conversation to that and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.960" end="01:29:26.000" style="s2">have the meeting actually be a meeting</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.199" end="01:29:28.960" style="s2">because i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.000" end="01:29:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.520" end="01:29:38.320" style="s2">so i guess like in light of what other</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.719" end="01:29:39.920" style="s2">i want to kind of try to qualify my</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.320" end="01:29:41.280" style="s2">previous statement which is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.920" end="01:29:43.280" style="s2">the reason i brought up algorithmic</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.280" end="01:29:45.520" style="s2">thinking was</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.280" end="01:29:46.639" style="s2">referring to another point john made i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.520" end="01:29:47.840" style="s2">not sure if it was in this video a</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.639" end="01:29:49.199" style="s2">different video</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.840" end="01:29:50.560" style="s2">but that the algorithmic thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.199" end="01:29:52.560" style="s2">non-convergent whereas heuristic</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.560" end="01:29:54.960" style="s2">thinking is and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.560" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">um would there be a felt sense of that</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.960" end="01:29:59.280" style="s2">and would that be part of written r</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:30:00.880" style="s2">to be able to have a part of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.280" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">practice around trying to detect</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.880" end="01:30:04.159" style="s2">these two versions of exemplified by the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:07.679" style="s2">chessboard</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.159" end="01:30:10.320" style="s2">problem as a practice so</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.679" end="01:30:11.120" style="s2">on that point i&#39;ve been working on a</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.320" end="01:30:14.480" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.120" end="01:30:16.880" style="s2">with mark and uh yeah i think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.480" end="01:30:17.679" style="s2">system is based on that distinction</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.880" end="01:30:21.199" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.679" end="01:30:22.080" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna use that in order to</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.199" end="01:30:26.639" style="s2">evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.080" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">the the ecology of practices so yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.639" end="01:30:31.360" style="s2">think i think that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.719" end="01:30:31.360" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.679" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">oh yeah just wanted to get this in uh i</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.159" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.440" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">i would actually be able to do a watch</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:43.040" style="s2">party</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.800" end="01:30:44.800" style="s2">because sometimes the sheer number of</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.040" end="01:30:47.280" style="s2">people in the call alone</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.800" end="01:30:49.760" style="s2">can break my internet and i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.280" end="01:30:53.360" style="s2">when i&#39;m watching a stream or i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.760" end="01:30:54.480" style="s2">like webcams on that just guarantees</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.360" end="01:30:57.199" style="s2">that it will break down</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.480" end="01:31:00.080" style="s2">so if if we did that then i literally</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.199" end="01:31:02.159" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to come anymore</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.080" end="01:31:03.760" style="s2">meaning even if you&#39;re not the one doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.159" end="01:31:05.520" style="s2">the video</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.760" end="01:31:08.639" style="s2">you can&#39;t watch any stream where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.520" end="01:31:08.639" style="s2">watching somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.040" end="01:31:12.400" style="s2">as far as i know</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.679" end="01:31:19.120" style="s2">yeah so this is actually why i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.440" end="01:31:20.080" style="s2">separate the watch party from the actual</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.120" end="01:31:21.360" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.080" end="01:31:23.600" style="s2">i think what should be two separate</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.360" end="01:31:26.320" style="s2">events i i agree</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.600" end="01:31:27.840" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a website you can use if</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.320" end="01:31:28.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to use the stream and</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.840" end="01:31:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.400" end="01:31:32.560" style="s2">watch together or whatever then you can</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.000" end="01:31:35.440" style="s2">have everybody on the same</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.560" end="01:31:35.440" style="s2">part of the video</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.600" end="01:31:38.880" style="s2">yeah we can use watch together</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.040" end="01:31:41.920" style="s2">that might be a way although the only</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.560" end="01:31:42.480" style="s2">downside is if we&#39;re recording it</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.920" end="01:31:43.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.480" end="01:31:45.520" style="s2">it might be interesting for people to</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.840" end="01:31:46.480" style="s2">watch you know you know like commentary</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.520" end="01:31:49.520" style="s2">videos</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.480" end="01:31:51.920" style="s2">uh with the would it show up in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.520" end="01:31:55.360" style="s2">stream too</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.920" end="01:31:58.400" style="s2">i wonder if i could use obs</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.360" end="01:31:58.960" style="s2">or something to have them both i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.400" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.960" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.960" end="01:32:09.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to put it on youtube be</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.840" end="01:32:13.840" style="s2">nice</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.159" end="01:32:17.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i think if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.840" end="01:32:18.159" style="s2">doing a watch party then you&#39;re just</p>
