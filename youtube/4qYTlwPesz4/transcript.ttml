<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">check this before we&#39;ve been live oh we</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">are public people might be watching cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">um so a solution raising is an hour long</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">we bring ourselves and our bias and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.080" style="s2">everything else to the conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:15.759" style="s2">all of your experience everything that</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">you bring but the idea is to generate</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.759" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">new not necessarily hold on to something</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">we had before coming to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:23.439" style="s2">so this is to run parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">conversation game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.439" end="00:00:26.560" style="s2">had last week although both of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">attended you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.560" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">welcome to bring what was what happened</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:32.000" style="s2">there into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t there so i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:35.120" style="s2">build on what was done there it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">parallel that anyone can watch it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.120" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">what they want to get out of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">game b this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">issue has come up consistently in game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">is how do you map it how does somebody</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:46.399" style="s2">new understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">it how does so this is the first time</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.399" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a solution on game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">specifically where people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to really participate</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">so we spend 15 minutes talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">what&#39;s currently being done</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">15 minutes talking about what we would</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">like in an ideal version of the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">and then we spend half</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">an hour usually talking about what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">could do with 10 000 people and 100 000</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">for this particular solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">because again he doesn&#39;t have 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re focusing on game b i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">say with a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">and ten thousand dollars but also with</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">ingenuity that&#39;s in game b right i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">there are people who are willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">some of the labor for free</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">so we don&#39;t need to have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">thousand dollars so i&#39;m just changing</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">the parameters so it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">could happen in game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">because again we don&#39;t have 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:33.520" style="s2">people and we could still stick with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars but then it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:36.640" style="s2">would be everyone putting in a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">dollars which i think is a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.640" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll play with that when we get there</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">so for the first part we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.840" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">what is current what is g mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">game b currently look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">and why it keeps being a topic that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">need we need to talk about so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">um we can each take a turn to share or</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">you can pass if you don&#39;t want to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">for that portion then we can have an</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">open discussion for the remainder of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">that time and then when it feels right</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">transfer on to the next part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">so again the first 15 minutes or rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">10 minutes about we&#39;ll be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">what is currently being done to math</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">and why we feel we need something</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">currently what&#39;s good and bad about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">what&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">either of you would like to start since</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t there last week i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">actually know what&#39;s currently being</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">done i&#39;m just gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">okay so what is currently being done i</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">to be honest not sure apart from</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">adriel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">quick project um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">list application but apart from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">i did not um find</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">any specific like uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">encompassing encompassing library or</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">catalog</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">of projects groups individuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">and i understand that it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">um first there&#39;s no clear definition of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">what game b</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">is and what criteria there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">for defining and determining if</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">something is game b or is something</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">a name a game b and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">yeah we as much as we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">define it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">write in stone what exactly we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">and uh what exactly is game b</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">in uh i guess the concern</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">um there are many concerns about it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">we don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">but at the same time the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">out there are real and you would very</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">much like to know about them</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">and have some sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">like overview maybe not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">uh of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">like everything from a specific angle</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">but more like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">uh we would like to know what is out</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">in very general terms so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">what has currently been done i know of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">several</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">projects that are in beta stage</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">um to be said that there are many people</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">working on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">and i did see uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">along those years few</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">designs of few descriptions of what such</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">a system would look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">but as i am aware there is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">written</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">yet so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">james do you want to share right um</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">so yeah i probably i feel like i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">not aware of probably a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s going on related to mapping</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">at the moment but there does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">quite a lot of it popping up</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">and it was yeah it was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">interesting in the call last week to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">some of the projects actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">connected to the game b space who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">different tools that are kind of related</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">to the subject of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">so one example is a group called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">and just to clarify this because it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">be confusing there&#39;s actually two</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">different mind mapping tools called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">brain but they&#39;re both spelled slightly</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">um the original one is spelt like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">the normal way you&#39;d spell the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">the new one uh which is the guys who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">involved with game b</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">it&#39;s spelt like uh b-r-a-n-e</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">like like membrane or something um</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">and yeah they&#39;re doing some really</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">interesting work um</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">there&#39;s also some some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">people who kind of came along who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">just been</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">involved in my mapping for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">using for example like the old version</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">and tools like kumu um to kind of plot</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">you know just even just from a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">personal perspective just to map out the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">things that they&#39;re interested in their</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">life to kind of keep track of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">different links that they come across</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">different projects they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">and to kind of organize it in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">framework that makes it easy for them to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">then go and find that information</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">and navigate through it um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">have an interest in this subject it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">kind of moving uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">pushing the ball forward uh in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">um for me i would say like</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">the value of mapping is that it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s actually relevant to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">different areas</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">so whenever you have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a landscape of some kind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">that&#39;s very complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">and filled with lots of different data</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to make sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">uh what i think of the value of a map is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">that it kind of takes all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">and reduces it down to a simple model</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s much easier to comprehend and has</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:01.919" style="s2">the kind of key</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">bits of information that you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.919" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">able to navigate that landscape</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">so that could be you know in a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:08.639" style="s2">basic sense that could be a physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:10.479" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">with just like a you know a paper map</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.479" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">that visualizes where the mountains are</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">and the villages and the roads</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">or it could be you know mapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">a bit more ephemeral like a social</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">and visualizing um different communities</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">and different types of connections</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">within that space that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t have a map to visualize</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">that would be very difficult to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">um and especially to kind of navigate</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">through so i think there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">of value</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">in maps for that kind of reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">but to me and this is what i was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">bringing up in the call last week</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">what i&#39;m most excited about with mapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">how it can be how people can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">around shared maps</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">um because i think like part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">that our brains work is that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">the way we understand reality in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">world around us is that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">we build maps out of the information</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">that we we take in we kind of build</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">models within our minds so we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">naturally wired to be able to build maps</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">and to do that in a very kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">flexible way</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">but i think what we lack at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">to build maps in that same kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">but collectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">in large groups that are often dispersed</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">you know across huge distances</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s where the real</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">potential lies in the future is if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">can kind of develop tools that enable</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">that are coordinating around any</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">different subject to be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">come together</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">and add their little pieces of data that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">they each have from their perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">and have that kind of synthesized in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">shared map</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">that takes in all that information and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">provides something that&#39;s very useful to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">in terms of kind of coordinating finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">and knowing where to add their</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">contributions</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">so to me it&#39;s like a there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">exciting potential there to level up</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">uh group collective intelligence through</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">designing the right tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">thank you i will try to take only a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">couple minutes to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">to do mine that the game b space is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">very interesting to map because one we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">is we don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going we</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know how we transition to it we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">we there&#39;s many people who have ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">how we do that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">mapping those and figuring out how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">you do your individual piece to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">but in doing so not like i want my sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">to add to the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">of the group not dissipate it and right</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">now because there&#39;s so many people come</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">into the games</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">be space and they&#39;re confused what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">going on what is game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">it&#39;s like we can&#39;t even answer that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">question let alone what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">here who&#39;s involved what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a handful of tools what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">is game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">for some of us it&#39;s the conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">some of us it&#39;s the personal work for</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">some of us it&#39;s the project work and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s all of the above</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">so to be able to have somebody come and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">be new and be like right where&#39;s the gas</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">station you need to pull up the map and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">say here&#39;s where we are and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">and because we don&#39;t have that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">i think we need to take a step back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">brainstorm what we would want</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">mapped before we ever map and the per</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">the problem is everyone&#39;s writing their</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">own map and it&#39;s never really going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">be able to be used by somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">because we orient differently there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">no north south east west</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">here&#39;s the gas station and here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">how you get there</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s well my version of game b is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">we do this with currency and this with</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">governance and it&#39;s okay if yours is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">different but we&#39;re going towards that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">and what is the next step</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">and so having the conversation like i</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">was just writing down here</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">in the game b space the game be facebook</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">groups there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">already three that really are mapping</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s game b</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">wiki which is dealing with all the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">things but it kind of came to a stand</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">still because</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">the idea of the wiki is that it does all</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">this stuff right it&#39;s the tools it tells</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">us what projects it tells us with people</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:58.640" style="s2">there&#39;s together tech which i&#39;m involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.640" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">is is involved in of okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">bringing our projects together and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">how can we create omni and solutions for</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">our project so they can get out in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">but the same issues keep coming up of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">how do you know what&#39;s going on how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">you understand what game b is and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">think it isn&#39;t one document</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">it is a bunch of kind of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">of definitions and there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">definitions for each word and multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">courses and to honor and truly get that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">there&#39;s complexity and no single map</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">can actually be the full thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be things</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">other people have on their map that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have on yours because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">care about gas stations you don&#39;t drive</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">right and there&#39;s other things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have that are common and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">so that to me is right now it feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">confusing to be a new person in game b</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">even not being a new person in game b</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">like when you come in it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">what&#39;s going on where can i be what can</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">what is what conversations can i attend</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">what conversations can i watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">what projects can i be part of how do i</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">create a project</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">how do we create a project together how</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">do we work through even not being</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">right and so this is a very fertile</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">for complexity and mapping complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">and working through this as a group</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">and having it be that there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">different stuff happening like there&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s the wiki there&#39;s the newer</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">mapping facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">group and there&#39;s also technology tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">which are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">looking at what&#39;s already out there that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">we can use in game b</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">but i feel like they come up constantly</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">right like the conversation generator</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">and then scheduling app and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">certain things that are tools that a few</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">people and to try to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">projects are happening and what people</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">and mapping that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">and it feels like we never get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">beta</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many betas like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">like none of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">are the thing and i don&#39;t know if many</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">people are mapping but there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">people who have</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">a project of projects janelle has one i</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">can never remember the name of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">praxium no i think that&#39;s kylie&#39;s one um</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">and so there&#39;s all of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">different somewhat competing things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">none of them have have resources or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">like and this is a good transition to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">the next part of the topic which is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">do we want it to look like and our idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">version of the future if we came</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">together and truly mapped game b</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">whatever that means to us as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">what does that look like to us and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">portion</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">of the conversation doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">match it&#39;s not a democracy if james&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">version of a map looks different than</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:17.519" style="s2">two says looks different than mine</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s totally fine</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s what could it look like right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">the elephant we&#39;re all feeling different</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">pieces and instead of arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">which one&#39;s right it&#39;s like putting</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">those pieces together to get the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">elephant</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">is this for this solution raising even</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">more so than the rest so</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">whoever would like to share their</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">version of what their ideal</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">version of mapping game b looks like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">the future whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">tomorrow or five years from now</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">welcome i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">i like what you said like i think a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">really key part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">it is that when people come to game b</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">just having a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">clear road map of like how to find their</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">way to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">um so that they can actually yeah find</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">their way into these different subjects</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">and if they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">you know if they&#39;ve got some kind of gem</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">that they&#39;ve got to give just making</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s very easy for them to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">where the most appropriate place for</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">that is to be shared</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve just noted down here a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">couple things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">to me an ideal map would would</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">uh one aspect would be that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">fractal so</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">you could have this kind of high level</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">map that takes you to the main sections</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">of game b</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">then as you navigate down to those areas</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like a fractal and you could kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">of go down to smaller</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">smaller and smaller details um</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">so i think in that sense you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">actually have a single</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">overarching map that kind of integrates</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">all the different</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">smaller and smaller areas that you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">find within game b</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">um another aspect of it for me that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">think would be really key</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">is is making it as flexible as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">kind of going back to your point that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">you know if if we&#39;re each keep creating</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">kind of separate maps but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">very much like customized to our</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">preferences then their their value to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">other people is going to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">limited</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">so if we can create maps that um have</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">to give users the ability to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">customize how they&#39;re viewed</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">so that they can kind of they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">highlight different aspects of the map</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">maybe that they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">um and you know even down to things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">potentially even customizing the ui so</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">see it in a different way i think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">make it more accessible to a wider range</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">of people um</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">see those two aspects come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to tell what should be on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">map because</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">because we are not uh 100</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">sure uh what it is we are mapping</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">so i also wanted to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">it is important what we don&#39;t map</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">and what we leave out of the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">one thing could be um</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">okay um what i wanted what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">thought it could start with</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">in the most simple way</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">so users who are new to the space are</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">not lost immediately</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">in the you know forest of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">and high level uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">descriptions of what is wrong with game</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">a and what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">like uh for example um</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">many people who come to the space</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">do come here because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">perceive something being wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">capitalism and they are very anti</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">so they would expect a map of tools to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">destroy</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">some economic system as they see being</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">fit to rule the world and it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">so if i wanted to start small</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">i would start with a set of well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">that can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">ascribed to like old can be viewed as</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">game b solutions or ideas but at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">not necessarily need uh this whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">concept of the mb being present at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">like for example we know that food and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">water are problematic especially in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">certain parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">so if um there was a webpage</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">describing various ideas about how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">clean water that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">game b on one hand as we</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">see game b but on the other hand for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">someone who is new</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">they would see okay this is a solution</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">for one particular problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">that we can all agree that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">problem it is real</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">and it can be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">um in local communities</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">in open source way and generally</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">like using non-game a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">solutions and ways of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">problems so</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">that would be one thing and then um it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">that there are just few groups of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">that we need to deal with and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">um like i said something like before</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">the bottom of uh muscle of pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">food water shelter communication</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">electricity like power</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">stuff like that and they all have their</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">defined uh sets of sub problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">and it all can fractally</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">expand from like okay we need there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">problem with uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">power as in electricity and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">um then there are solutions and uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">it would just open like a tree like</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">not flower tree and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">it could be visualized uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">in of course 3d space as we discussed on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">this big</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">big uh meeting about mapping</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">and uh yeah the brain one</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">or the other and add various other</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">solutions that deal with mapping</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">uh they will be very useful in this in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">this area uh but they are not complete</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">uh to be sufficient uh to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">like not only visualize everything but</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">have additional um okay i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">ahead of myself i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">uh technical um details not needed</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">at this point so yeah flattery</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">tree like structure that&#39;s what i would</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.799" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">like to see and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">is what would be the least confusing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">new people</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">because it would start with okay the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">problem is water and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">solutions abcd uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">and then each of the solutions would</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">their own set of like two more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">detailed way of uh describing</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">in my ideal world is the technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:33.919" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">it is not known by game b but game b</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.919" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">gave me the language around it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">it&#39;s having somebody be able to come in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">have their own individual unique map</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">based on who they are where can they</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">find their most</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">where can they find their teams of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">people how can they find what projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">would most be useful for them both that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">they would get</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">the most benefit being on that team and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">also the team would must be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">um what i was sitting here drawing was</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">this idea between</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">its map so having where we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">we might be in conflict with but that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">we&#39;re starting somewhere and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">trying to understand this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">capitalism this thing called game a this</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">thing called history</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">and we might absolutely differ on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:10.320" style="s2">broken about what right now but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.320" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">we also might differ on what game b</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">actually is what does constitute game be</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s all of these interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">that are different depending on who you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">are so for me it&#39;s omni-win solutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s concentrated on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">anti-rivalry solutions that actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">getting better the more people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">involved in scalability and being a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">natural attractor and out-competing game</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s in its own its own field for</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">other people it&#39;s not all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">part of that but not all of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">for me game b is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">sweet spot of long my bend diagrams but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">really game b is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">is all of our interconnecting circles</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">together and showcasing that i like what</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">james had to say that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">having to be individualistic the ui</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">being what i see can be in development</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">individualized to me but understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know almost like a choose your</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">own adventure like here&#39;s how where i</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">think we&#39;re broken</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">right like like my version of the map</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">would be where we&#39;re starting where i</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">and then the many different paths that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">could get us there</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow mapping that so that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">individual has access to their</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">best information about where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">how they understand it their best</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">version of this this idea in the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">of this ideal world we&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">get to because</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">utopias aren&#39;t possible because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">you&#39;re maximizing it for your values</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">the path to getting there is like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">magical just everyone having that vision</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">and starting from where they are instead</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">of arguing about where we start and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">where we get to we just start moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">it actually weaves together to be game b</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">but that only showcases in the doing of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">it it is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">different people working on different</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">projects and figuring out the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.679" style="s2">fracturedness of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">that isn&#39;t fractal it&#39;s fractured and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.679" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">then making the fractured fractal</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">and constantly be instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">everyone&#39;s dissipated</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">hey why do you feel that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">what&#39;s going on what would make it make</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">sense to you like having the feedback in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">for what&#39;s not working so it continually</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">be improved for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">and i think that is a bit of what mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">look like that&#39;s the best summary i</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">heard about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">uh game b space which is making the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">fractured fractal</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">this is exactly what it is about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">i was like yeah there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">the fractal and the fracture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">yeah because now we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">shards of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">goodwill energy skills and everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">they are just not connected so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">the way i see this this project it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">be not even</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">well there are so many different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">of this that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">one meeting is not going to cover even a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">small amount of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">but uh in short uh there&#39;s not only the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">mapping aspect</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">uh the knowledge of what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">there is the connectivity aspect as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">there is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">uh enabling that this talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">everyone involved who might be involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">would like to be involved and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of work very exciting</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">yeah but i think there is ways like we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">because it hasn&#39;t been done before</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">we look at it like that&#39;s a chaotic mess</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">that can never kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">happen like these conversations never</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">happened until they did right</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">we&#39;re able to come up with a possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">adjacent possible that we could create</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">right now with ten thousand people at a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">just having the conversation showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s possible right like once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">able to run is it the five-minute mile</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">then everyone was not everyone but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">of people were able to break five in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">mile</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">that having people showcase what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">creates the idea that&#39;s possible because</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">game b is complex right having everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">have food everyone have water everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">have electricity everyone have these</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">omnium solutions</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">we have different ideas on how to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">there yet i do think we have a co</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">fairly common if if we had let&#39;s say 100</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">game b people</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">brainstorm what are all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">would need to be in place for you to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">living your game be</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">we would see that although none of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">have exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">we all have very common overlapping ones</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">like having a tool to assess how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">get water how do we get food</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">the best way for ourselves right having</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">information that&#39;s accessible and usable</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">on you know if we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">pandemic oven 19 but like on climate</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">change on healthcare on anything that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with having information</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s usable and accessible</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">and so breaking it down in that way so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">we can see the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">and then how many people are working on</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">what solution offers what and can we you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">know combine them and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">mapping that mapping where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">how we get to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">our version of game b gets us all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">game because my version might not</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">include feeding the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">it does but i don&#39;t know why it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">but right i might think it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">to educate the world i want everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">have access to everything but</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">i&#39;m a weirdo that way it&#39;s like active</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">mapping</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not only knowledge but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">all also</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">connectivity and i think it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.840" style="s2">common mistake to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">um and it&#39;s very game a to think that uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">everyone sorry i&#39;m connecting to some</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">other piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">uh should follow the same manifesto or</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">the same set of values</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">everyone is in game game be actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">expected to</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">uh do their own thing by their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">rules to some extent uh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">on a foundation of the same set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">values more or less because</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">the higher order values seem to be very</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">similar between people like all over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">um but yeah by doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">uh feeling uh the own like niche</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">of like i want to be doing this so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">somehow magically it is connected with</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">every every scene</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">else that is going on and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">uh what everyone else is doing that by</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">doing their</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">own thing they just create everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">creating the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">so what we need is a like a platform</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">um in a forest that trees like lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:19.039" style="s2">and uh on the surface like they are not</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.039" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">maybe they are but you know but</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">underneath the surface</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">uh there is this whole like mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s vast networks of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">and value exchange</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">that can cover like square miles</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">and i i see the platform being something</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">like something like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">connecting providing a communication</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">means of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">means of coordination and cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">in the most agnostic way possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">like no ideology no</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">enforcing a specific set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">views or values it&#39;s not what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s only for making cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">communication possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">yeah i think that is actually the side</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">that for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">because mapping where we are and where</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">we need to get to and how we get there</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">is very different for every individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">is sorry i lost my train of thought are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">you just saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">having the tools i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">it was great though if it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">gone wouldn&#39;t it either it&#39;ll be back if</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;ll be back that was making me think</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">um what you&#39;re saying which is that one</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">value of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">is that it can can enable it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">framework that enables people to all be</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">acting at their kind of individual level</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">doing that the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">and yet somehow weave those</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">contributions together so that you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">emerging at the collective level that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be achieved by any of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">individuals alone and they may not even</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">aware of what that bigger picture is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">going to be but by having</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">the right kind of tools and framework it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">can actually weave</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">all these different contributions</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">together so i think it can be a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">integrating process and i i it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">the um the analogy of like similarities</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">to actually the way our brain works</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">in that you know we build very complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">models of the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">and you know a single neuron is not able</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">to hold</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">the fullness of one of those models it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">only through coordinating those neurons</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">very effectively that you get this</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">capacity to build</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">complex models that transcend by a long</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">way the capabilities of any individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">neurons</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s my kind of like one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">my dreams with mapping is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">if we can if we can work out the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">dynamics and we can build those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">basic tools</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s going to start small and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">they&#39;ll probably be a long period where</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">it&#39;s being tested and refined but once</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">we get that capacity it&#39;s it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t really any scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">limits and it could be one of those kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">of game b technologies where</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">actually the more people that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">participate the um the value goes up</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">rather than down so you can actually you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">know at global scale suddenly you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">incredibly uh complex things being</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">mapped a very quick speed</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">um just by having the right tool that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">everyone could log on online can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">explore the map that&#39;s that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">created already they can find the areas</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">that where there&#39;s blind spots in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">map they can add their little</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">contributions</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s doing this simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">you just get this this complex landscape</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">mapped very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">through everyone&#39;s collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">yeah i love that and i remember the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">thought which was</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">to what what you should said and do not</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">to deal with this is individuals right</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">we&#39;re individuals living our lives so</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">what does it look like as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">as jubilee how do i have as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">as much sovereignty as possible the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">irony is there&#39;s only so much i can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">by myself in sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">do collectively like if i&#39;m fed and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">housed and clothed</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">i have more sovereignty to not rely on</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">my government to not rely on outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">and so keep owning that and looking for</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">places to from our celebrity and then in</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">looking at okay how does this group have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">sovereignty how do we decide on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">collective governance and then have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">bigger</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">group the group of groups to not how</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">how little authority do they have on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">teams and the individuals right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">because we are the ones making it up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">that i&#39;m exploring in my own life like</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">the war versus the dance and i know</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">sometimes i&#39;m in war with people that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">want them to do what i want them to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">because of the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">right i want people to stay at home</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">right now how dare you go out this is my</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s like it&#39;s they&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">to spite me and they&#39;re doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">their own best interest if i&#39;m needing</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">to be in control over someone&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">even though i course i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">control over their life but my</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">bean wants to be in control of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">right i want like new</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">governing rules that will get you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">behave in the way i want you to behave</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">instead of how do i behave in the way i</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">want to behave and how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">a society that if there is a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">be it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">enables people to be that way instead of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">enforcing it and that is very again the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">individualistic like what is my map and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">how do i increase my sovereignty how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">i find my groups and how do i help other</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">people find their groups</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">and then how can the tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">technology facilitate that in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">process without ruling over it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">right without saying you have to do x y</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">and z to be part of this to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">group you might need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">but you could always find a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">group and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">hopefully as few rules as possible over</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">bigger meta group that is facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">yeah that actually reminded me of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">conversation i was having with</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">uh eric liberate mankind the other day</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">but we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">he&#39;s got this concept of the monarchy he</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">calls it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">which is kind of this kind of balance</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">between the monarchy which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">um well i from my perspective i see it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">as kind of like representing order</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">and then anarchy representing chaos</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">although it&#39;s i know the model is more</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">that kind of simplifies it down but um</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">one of the points that came up in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">conversation was that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">um you know in in kind of oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">dictatorships it actually takes an</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">enormous amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">to force people to do things that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">don&#39;t naturally want to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">so if you can design a system that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">coordinate people and kind of harness</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">them them doing the things that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">most enjoy you actually as a system</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">become capable of a huge amount more</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">with much less energy expenditure and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.279" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">well so it&#39;s kind of like a win-win on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">all dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">um and these these kind of systems that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">try to kind of control populations</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">through like rigid</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">dictatorial laws and stuff it can only</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">work temporarily and it&#39;s very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:45.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s just people aren&#39;t happy</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.760" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">they&#39;re being forced to do what they</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">and that you have to employ and pay</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">people to enforce the other people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just um</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">enormous waste of energy versus a system</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">that&#39;s able to coordinate people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">and unique interests um so if we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">do that and maybe mapping can be a part</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">just helping people you&#39;ve got interests</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">find the place that they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">can contribute out to the collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting on a scale</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">where on one extreme</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">there is a dictatorship very centralized</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">uh which is telling people exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">to do and how</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">and um steering uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">from central point like everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">people are unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">and motivation is very low and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">the overall energy of the system is low</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s a struggle to get anything done</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">definitely um</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">those systems tend to not last very long</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">or if they do it&#39;s it&#39;s costing like</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">enormous amount of blood basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">and then there are systems where uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like the free market metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">kind of appropriate here because what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">is kind of similar it takes the best of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">the free market idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">which is everyone is doing their thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">and somehow magically it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">produces like great results for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">which is not necessarily true uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">as we see in the world there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">something to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s like the shadow of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">is also very strong and it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">talked too much about</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">uh yeah for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">uh the shadow being that the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">is always</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">people are forced to do what</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">um to do something</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">they are free to choose what uh work</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">they do but they still need to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">um because of the dynamic of uh if i</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">i will not have any money and then i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">will starve and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">game over so there is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">and um if we took oh yeah and free</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">market is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">individualistic the basic uh thing about</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">free market is</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">everyone is like an individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">magic happens between</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">individuals on some higher level and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">what we are talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">more like uh yes everyone is doing their</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">but we also do the thing collectively</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">and we are able to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">the collectives we are in like local</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">communities local uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">local but interest groups and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">dynamic in those groups</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">uh is not based on just monetary</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">values not on money being past the scent</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">in any direction just</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">recognizing our best interest</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">is i think that the key here</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m just going to switch over to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">the next topic so you don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">time you usually have half an hour we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">only have about 20 minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">to explore it of what could game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">actually create right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">if it had a thousand people like</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">dedicated to even just collecting their</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">data and be part of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">and then what could those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">people create together if they</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">were able to volunteer let&#39;s say three</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">four hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">a month and then also ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">dollars so you have those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">people putting in ten dollars and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">also have them contributing some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">their intellectual emotional physical</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">labor what could we create together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">of course everything&#39;s voluntary so</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not like forcing a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">what could be created that would entice</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">them would be a natural attractor</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">that game b could do that maybe isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">working solely in their own their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">interests where that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">is able to weave together to be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">collective collective benefits so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">anyone has any ideas on what we could do</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">as an adjacent possible for</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">a b mapping i will let you start</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">well i think there&#39;s actually already</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">some interesting things that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t even necessarily need an</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">injection of cash that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">kind of naturally developing like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">brain project</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">where they&#39;ve already got a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">beta product</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re developing it pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">they&#39;re hoping to have it live</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">so people can test it out fairly soon</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what the exact date is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">but part of their plan is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">which can be shared with the game b</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">community that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">ask a bunch of different questions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">they&#39;re actually i&#39;ve got a call with</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">them tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">and hunter to kind of discuss to talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">through what would</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">uh what good questions would be to ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">people but you know it could be things</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">um you know what what subjects do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">think are relevant to game a or game b</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">what things are you personally most</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">interested in which ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">do you think are most relevant versus</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">not relevant</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of different types of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">questions that could gather up data from</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">the community</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">and then that could be kind of plotted</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">into a map graph type thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">where you know you&#39;ve got all this data</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">suddenly represented in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">people can explore through it and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">can kind of find</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">different communities or they could find</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">people who are interested in different</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">things or they could</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">kind of get a sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">collective perspective is of game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">um just through the way that data is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">visualized</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">so i think stuff like that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">already just in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">developing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">and i think in the next year we&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:24.079" style="s2">few things like that starting to pop up</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.079" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">to me the thing that&#39;s most exciting</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">about it i guess if there was</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">you know more participation and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">kind of continued to develop in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">positive way</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">is that once we&#39;ve got some of those</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">tools in place that it could actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">uh be beneficial to all the different</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">things that game b is doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">so you know gamey projects gamey online</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.680" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">like all these different groups they all</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">share the same need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">organize the content that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">and allow people to find and explore</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">through that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">so i think i see that as being like one</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">of the goals of gaming mapping is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:57.520" style="s2">produce something that&#39;s actually useful</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">all the other groups and to game b</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">as a whole so it&#39;s kind of again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">like fractal in its potential uses</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">yeah 10 000 people can gets like produce</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">a lot of data which is like</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">two things one is gathering the data and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">then uh processing and visualizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">the data and results so 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">could start immediately as soon as there</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">is some questionnaire uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">just fill it in and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">see what happens then</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s a lot of of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">that can be done and is being done in</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">this space for</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">less money than it would cost any</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">individual one to do or less it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">about like not necessarily dissipating</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">the energy into eight different projects</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">and picking which one&#39;s the best and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">focusing our energy there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">like one of the things that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">is with a thousand people is do</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:03.520" style="s2">something i had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">talked to when i first came into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.520" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">game b space when extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">was talking about their citizen</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">assemblies and i was like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">why do we want why are we out in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">streets protesting to get our</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">governments to instill citizen</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">assemblies</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">we&#39;re the citizens we can just hold</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">assemblies like we could just get those</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">you know gather the information on</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">climate change present it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s understandable for us</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">like there&#39;s things we can do without</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">going through the government and doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">something similarly with the thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">to so that it&#39;s different through time</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">zones have zoom</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">rooms and have it be that we&#39;ve asked</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">these questions right instead of it just</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">a survey having conversations about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">does game b</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">mean to me what is game what is what are</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">the subject matters that i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">are important and then seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">interconnecting circle seeing where you</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">why history is important to me and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if history is important</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">everyone else if it&#39;s important to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">how can i map that on to game b and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">can in reverse having one place we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">go to both input and get</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">the people involved in game b both the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">the people actually involved right where</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">we&#39;re i&#39;m a game b person</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">contact me right and then there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">who maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t game b but they&#39;re game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">adjacent like jordan peterson i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">think has maybe even heard about game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">but a lot of people follow him and</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">found through here right jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">more and jim wrap more game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">they&#39;ve identified themselves as game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re also game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">adjacent in that people want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">all of their content right and do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">i think having a way to know who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">on whose podcast and which ones are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">most important what they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">instead of kind of giving everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">homework in the game space i can already</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">you first get here there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">podcasts so many just to catch up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">you realize you can&#39;t never are you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">going to be able to watch all of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">hall stuff and all of jim rot stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">he can&#39;t even watch all my stuff and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">not even not</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">like it was just too many conversations</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">about participating in them</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">but having someone say hey watch this</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">hey everybody watch this i&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">actually distill the points to you so</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to watch it</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s catalog so if we need the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">relevant parts we can go to it and see</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">and have that be more more relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">both just</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">after conversation and then actually put</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">energy and time into creating that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">work through that process together</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">and even if it falls apart because it</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:57.599" style="s2">is that we learn and if we do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:59.200" style="s2">transparently we learning grow and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.599" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">learns and grows too</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.200" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">and literally start anywhere and keep</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">is is the solution to everything start</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">somewhere and keep improving it and do</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">so openly and transparent</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">that would be one of the questions on</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">the questionnaire uh about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">game b and what to think about it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">see like what uh how did you get here</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the most obvious and then what</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">you got was most uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">enlightening to you it&#39;s like which part</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">of usually there is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">um jordan greenhouse interview with</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">and then in about nine ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">in there is this piece about uh how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">like the problem the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">uh incentivization i think it was uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">and it was so that was the part that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">struck me as the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">most important thing ever in in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">and if everyone said okay for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">it was this point for me it was this</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">interview and this part of it like</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">watch this five minutes and you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">more than if you watched</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">uh two hours of someone else&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">which might be equally important but</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">the five minutes is what it is all about</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">something like this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">like mapping was already been done this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">is like too much too much information</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">and knowing what conversations a big</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">used words and it kind of represents</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">that on a graph did you guys see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">no i saw this like a screenshot of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">and i was most impressed yeah it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">um but yeah to me that&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">taster of some of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:08.839" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">nick nick red red marks name</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">stuff like that i&#39;d seen him kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">participating in game b and then that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">popped up and i was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">oh that&#39;s amazing um but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.680" style="s2">that&#39;s like a way of you know using</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">some software to kind of take a video</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">which would otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">you&#39;d have to sit through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">thing or read a transcript but it just</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">instantly visualizes um the content of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">that video</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">and like he&#39;s chosen a certain way to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">that but you could imagine all</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">different kinds of ways of visualizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">things that pick up on different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:42.880" style="s2">of aspects of the video</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">so i think stuff like that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">and then another thought i had was</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">um an idea i was thinking about a while</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">ago was</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">you know imagine if as you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">exploring through the different facebook</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">the game b facebook group or some of its</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">subgroups if you came across</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">a post or a comment even and you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">like oh that really links well with this</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">other post this other comment thread</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">that i saw the other day</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">if you could just kind of highlight both</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">of them somehow and draw a link between</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">them and describe that relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">then if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">everyone was able to do this</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">simultaneously you could start building</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">up these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">networks between related content and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s like another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">mapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">eu related uh concept that could allow</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">to kind of help other people find stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">and then also enable</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">each other to explore better you know if</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">you come across an interesting subject</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">you just you can see straight away that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">there&#39;s links to other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">related to that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for you to find um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s another cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">thing that i think could</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know exactly you know my views</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">are on this is that i don&#39;t think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">of these innovations are going to come</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">through facebook</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">or many of these dominant platforms so i</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">i still kind of think that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">we need some other platform um</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know how soon that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">happen but i can just see</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">all these different ideas and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">there&#39;s so many people working on it it</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">just seems inevitable to me that at some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">point we are going to make that leap and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just going to unlock</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">an enormous amount of um different</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">tools and features and enable us to kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">of uplevel our collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">such a huge amount machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">i would say uh could be very useful in</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">this respect because</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:28.079" style="s2">as much as i trust people to find</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">links and connections that&#39;s what our</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.079" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">brains do</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">after all we are good at it not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.720" style="s2">see the same connections but</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">collectively we can make something</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.720" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">but uh if it could be helped with some</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">kind of machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">application whatever stuff and that for</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">uh the way i visualized it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">if i was if you were it was in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">middle of a graph</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">and i said okay i want to know more</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">governance on blockchain whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">then uh around straight away</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">notes of a notes</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">pop up with most matching what i just</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">uh asked the system to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">and then uh by uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.040" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">kind of weighted proximity thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">uh i could i should be able to explore</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">further and further and the connections</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">made by i think what nick</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">did something like this it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">basis for uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">either people doing the matching and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">linking</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">um i think google algorithm works</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">in some similar way</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">page ranking all right</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">so yeah it can be done by a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">computer to actually link everything and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">show it</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">uh in the most matching document</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">to what you want to see is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">and then further the most matching</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">document to the document you just saw</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">is this and this and exploration um</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">like going on a fractal uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">tree and further away it would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">yeah something like this and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">yeah that would be that would be cool i</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">just wanna we only have about</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">less than five minutes left and so how</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">we end this is we go around and each</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:40.160" style="s2">person can say what they think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">the solution we count with or you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.160" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">complicate in the moment that you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">is the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">you think would be the most impactful or</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">solving what we are trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.920" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">which today is mapping gaming</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">i guess for me it would be just creating</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">the the most basic um</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">kind of mapping tool that&#39;s that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">the most basic features required but</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s enough to enable</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">mapping of all different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">subjects and doing it collaboratively</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">it sounds like a very complicated thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">but i actually think you could reduce it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">down to a pretty simple set of rules</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">and dynamics it just needs to be really</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">well thought through</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">um and have a nice ui to kind of match</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">but i think if we were able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">in a very basic level which</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">i just think it could be applied in all</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">these different areas</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">and different scales as well so i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">if we could nail that initial design</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">i think that&#39;s it could grow into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">of an unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">tree of other different things</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">yeah i totally agree uh starting small</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">with something very simple because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">yeah most</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">important thing is to just start even</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">if it was a system with one text</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">box with enabling people to write down</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">stuff and then connect it to some other</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">there will be a start and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">where data</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">starts being gathered and then it can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">always improved</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">instead of designing a perfect system</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">from scratch and</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">you know just start actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">i really like the work that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.920" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">doing that you demoed to us</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">in the call i think it was on thursday</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">remember with the lines and stuff yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.800" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">thought that was really cool</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">are you still working yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">furiously oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:45.839" style="s2">if you want to chat about it some other</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">time yeah it&#39;s it sounds like he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.839" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">fine with some of my ideas um as well so</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">jubilee by the way this is what i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">to show you on</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">our last meeting uh which didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">couldn&#39;t screenshare but</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">yes that&#39;s something um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">yeah it started very long time ago with</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:12.000" style="s2">wanting to do some something that i no</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">longer want to do but</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">still i have this idea in my head that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">it needs to be expressed</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">sometimes there are ideas that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">yeah i have this sorry to take up time</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">with this but</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">i had something like uh there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">certain ideas that want to express</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">themselves and they use humans as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">vehicle of um enacting this</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">this idea so that&#39;s i had it stuck in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">head and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">i just need to uh finish it</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:50.559" style="s2">and i am totally definitely happy to uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">use that as some kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.559" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">to show it more to work on this and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">a foundation of some useful tool at</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">that would be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">because as much as i um in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.319" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">last few weeks i</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">watched most of the tools out there</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">the mapping tools uh including the brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.319" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">the seven vortex thing is also very cool</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">then the hollow web is also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">but each of them is um</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think uh of any of them that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">this is the perfect thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">and all of them are missing</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">uh like some part of some aspect and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">obviously uh the least we can do</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">like the modest thing to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">make a tool that does it all</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">so yeah i love it because while i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">writing down mine you gave me a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">so i think although i didn&#39;t really talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">about it during our solutions one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the tools that in common</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">would help with all of the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">um as well as like feeding ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">getting that stuff ready so we have more</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">that&#39;s harder to do having a like a yelp</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">of apps that we own together that we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">trust when someone works for a tool and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s available that you know it exists</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">but what i love that you gave me</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">is like part of knowing what one feature</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">has another feature has that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">to know which one to use right of all</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">the team building ones which one&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">but to be able to actually say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">missing why don&#39;t i use this one because</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">then we can kind of create one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">the best of all worlds right like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">what is facebook missing a lot but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">that you actually articulate it right</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">that the other ones have</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">and to be able to see when nick creates</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">something when matu creates so anyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">creates something in or out of game b</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s then able to be available to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">the world in a way that goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">around facebook and google right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">like hey we know it exists</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">is it trustworthy does it work and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">how can we improve it even</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">whether we own it together or somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">else owns it how can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">continually improve this so we can trust</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">it more so it gets to be the best of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:02.000" style="s2">both worlds right it gets to have all</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">the features that we would need it to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">and at a price point we can afford which</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">hopefully is zero</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">you know like the app can sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">the people can sustain itself but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">people using it have as little</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">input as possible because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">anti-rivalrous and the more they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">involved in it the better benefit there</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">is for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">but we are definitely at the hour mark</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">does anyone have any closing statements</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:23.290" style="s2">before</p>
