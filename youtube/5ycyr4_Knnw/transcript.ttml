<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">i&#39;m also known by the tibetan name</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">rinsing palmer</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">i write at vadriananow.com</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">this is the first session of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">foundational series in which we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">to draw on the methods and principles of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">vajrayana buddhism to inform an approach</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">to contemporary life and practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">and so vadriana means literally the path</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">of the vajra</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">the vadrapath avatara is a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">weapon symbolizing indestructible</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s this is avadra it&#39;s a little one</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">you can get some very big ones so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">vadriana</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">is eventually about learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">access and harness the raw power</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">of your personal emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">mental social circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">in order to engage in useful creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">activity that benefits other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">vajrayana&#39;s it&#39;s quite a late</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">development in buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">developed roughly around the 6th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">in india and a couple of centuries after</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">that it spread into tibet</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">it also developed distinct branches in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">japan</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">and in some parts of southeast asia</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">vatriana comprises several fields or</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">domains of practice you might say it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">includes buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">tantra which is quite distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">hindu tantra</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">there are many crossovers historically</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">it also includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">zog chan and it includes mahamudra</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">these are all terms that you may have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">come across in the buddhist sphere</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">so what all these fields of practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">have in common</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">is that they&#39;re characterized by an</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">attitude towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.680" style="s2">physical emotional mental social</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">experience that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.680" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">non-renunciative adriana&#39;s methodology</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">draws on</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">involvement in actively</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">engaging with desires with attachments</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">with emotions and circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s very different from some other</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">forms of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">but as tantra employs the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">and transformation requires engagement</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">it requires involvement</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">job chen and mahamudra work on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">principle of integration</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">and liberation you can&#39;t integrate</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">without engaging so</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">all of adriana is it&#39;s defined by</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">the employment of non-renunciative</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">methodology</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what distinguishes it from other</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">sorts of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">so a little bit about myself i have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">background in traditional</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">vajrayana practice i was an apprentice</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">in the yarrow tale lineage</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">of the tibetan myanmar school</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">many years i took tantric vows in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">2002 so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">i practiced vajrayana in a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">setting for more than 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">and then about i guess 18 months ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">i gave up adherence to the ordination</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">vows in the traditional form that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">and i moved away from that traditional</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">setting it&#39;s a little bit about my</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">um jared and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">got together about a year ago um</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">we were discussing practice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">meditation in relation to vajrayana</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">practice and evolving ground came about</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">as a result</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">of our discussions over the last year</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">adriana&#39;s view and employing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">principles of adriana in contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">form so</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">maybe you could introduce yourself jared</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">say a little bit about yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">a serious meditator for around six or</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">seven years</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">um i started out in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">pragmatic dharma scene</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">and spent a lot of time um with uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">unified mindfulness which comes from</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">shinzen young and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">um and then also a fair bit of amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">time in uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">the mind illuminated by juliudasa which</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">um a little bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">shamatha concentration path um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">it always kind of felt a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">an outsider</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t really sign up i felt like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">tourist um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">uh ran into charlie&#39;s blog because she</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">talking about um the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">uh shamatha</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">which is a similar practice but from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">adriana view and so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">radically different in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">um and so uh you know over the the past</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">year we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">kind of moved into more vajrayana</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">practice and and stances and perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">just kind of overall disposition uh and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">finally found like i was like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">this is where i belong i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">and uh and yeah we wanted to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">share it and we did one of these stoa</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">sessions</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">um about a month or two ago i believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">thinking like maybe a few random yogi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">would show up and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">uh ended up being a lot more interest</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">than we thought so it seemed like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">was the right time to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">to try and uh uh you know do something a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">little bit crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">um so i wanted to give a quick</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">little outline on on the plan for today</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">uh and then hand things back</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">to charlie to uh talk about</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">so yeah so basically we&#39;ll have a quick</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">charlie and i will we&#39;ll talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">bit about uh those concepts</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do some q a uh and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">move into</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">uh breakout sessions uh for each</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">individual to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">individual groups to be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">relate and and have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">more personal stuff and then we&#39;ll uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">regroup uh as</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">uh um as we wrap things up uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">think we&#39;ll also after we stop recording</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">um we&#39;ll probably stick around for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">uh if there&#39;s some lingering questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">or things</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">um so so yeah feel free to stick around</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">a bit afterwards uh if that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">something that&#39;s interesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s it let me let me look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">my we we&#39;re trying to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">more organized last time we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">kind of flying by the city yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">kind of spontaneous yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re we have a plan today</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">um yeah charlie you want to start right</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll say a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">we&#39;re intending</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">and what we&#39;re doing here um</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">so yeah our intentions are to create</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">the space for a community of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">and practice that&#39;s informed by</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">vajrayana so really for people who want</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">with the views and with the principles</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">and methods</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">the functions that were all developed in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">the traditional vajrayana lineages but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">the cultural worldview that generated</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">and with newly adaptive forms</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">that are fitting for contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">so vadriana forms the base</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">the root for this series evolving ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">traditional vadriana is the ground from</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">which we&#39;re evolving if you like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">um so in particular we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">and function in vadriana method and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">path and so all the way through the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">series we&#39;re going to be coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">that theme</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll be exploring what that means and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">how to employ vajrayana method</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">in different contexts so this isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">rejection</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">i want to make that very clear this</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">isn&#39;t a rejection for</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">something new it&#39;s the offering of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">something new</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">as well that is very much grounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.839" style="s2">in a history and in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">lineage that has a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.839" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">coherence to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">so it really should be possible for</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">anybody practicing in this community to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">into a more traditional setting and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">more traditional world view without</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">some great sort of conflict in principle</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">or some kind of contradiction there</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t happen and vice versa it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">also ought to be possible for people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">from traditional settings to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">practice with evolving ground and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">actually have some sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">familiarity and recognition</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">so what i&#39;m saying is that if if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">understand how a practice method works</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">in terms of its principle and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">in terms of its function then</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s translatable into lots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">so the um</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">the the principle and what it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">um and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">context are all the sort of key elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">here that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">make it possible to move between</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">different environments</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">with similar sorts of practices so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">series comprises the ground or the base</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">from which all kinds of forms new forms</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">might arise</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">but the material presented is hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be like the 101</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">for the system that we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">and so as such it&#39;s also the link it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">like a link in a chain</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">back to traditional vajrayana practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">so what i want to say about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">the more involved you become in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">of system of practice the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">informative it can be to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">and the roots of that practice or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">tradition of knowledge tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">knowledge if you like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">and it can save a lot of time it can cut</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">through incoherence</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">so once you start having a feel for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">and its practices how they might</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">function in your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">understanding how they were generated</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">and what gave rise to them</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;m talking socially and politically</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">here as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very good at some point to get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">much rounder</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">fuller sense of the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">practice the historical context of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">practice rather than</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">what you might call an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">understanding this applies across all</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">domains i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">so you begin to get a much better sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">of how and why</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">a particular mode or method functions in</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">the way that it does</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">and in doing so you&#39;re better able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">predict how something&#39;s likely to pan</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">what the different outcomes might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">from following</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">specific modes of practice for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">i should say something about principle</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">and function so jared and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">use the terms principle and function</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">frequently</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">or when you&#39;re meditating</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">um with anything really it&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">to have some kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">of understanding at least of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">where it&#39;s supposed to lead and if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.320" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">get into the habit</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">of figuring out and understanding the</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">and understanding the function of your</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">then that can help bring some coherence</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">navigating your way through all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">practices and cultural views and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">different histories that are available</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">so i think i&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">about method which is the topic</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">of today&#39;s session</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">so each each session in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">foundational series we&#39;re going to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">one topic</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">today&#39;s topic is method and what do i</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">method um</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s quite probable that i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">slow down</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">sometimes because i really want to use</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">language quite carefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">and i want to be clear about what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">and you know i think we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">a kind of tendency in buddhist circles</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">to use phrases that have become a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">cliched maybe a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re very widely used</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">so what that leads to is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">ambiguity or a lot of fuzziness</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">um around meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">sometimes you know this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">particular cliche or phrase use you</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">um if you if you stop to notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">you can kind of get the feeling that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">function of a word or a phrase is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">in keeping with what it purports to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">like it purports to point to something</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">special or something different or</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">non-ordinary but the actual function in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">is it&#39;s just to give a feel-good vibe or</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">or something or signal authority or</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">so i think i think it&#39;s really useful to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">notice how</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">words function um</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">socially somatically</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">you know how is the use of certain words</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">affecting your sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">what function does the particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">language that some guru or some</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">authority is using what what function</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">seem to serve i&#39;m kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">tangential here and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">was supposed to be talking about method</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">so anyway yeah i think some</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">words have been horribly abused in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve come to sort of be ways to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">manipulate people&#39;s hopes and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">desires if you know what i mean they</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">subtly manipulate promise and i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">that happens a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">in spiritual circles reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">the word reality is a word that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten abused</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">in this way</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">so anyway i think what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">that i don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">with words and language but because of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">that it means being very conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">maybe a little laborious so i might need</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">to just kind of stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">and think sometimes um about</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying and how i&#39;m saying it</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">so anyway method method</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">so i want to say something about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">how i see method as being different</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">to tool</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">these they&#39;re nouns they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">somewhat distinct i&#39;m using the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">method in a very particular way</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">so a tool is a thing with which you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">apply a technique</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">think of some some literal examples you</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">have a wrench you fit the wrench to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">bolt head you apply some force</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">you turn the nut it&#39;s very precise</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">not a lot of wiggle room there your</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">wrench is like is like a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">size it&#39;s going to be quite um</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">defined it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">very adapted for a particular specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">you fit the nut you turn it you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">could apply this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">wrench in many contexts</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">um in british that&#39;s a spanner for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">brits</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">now so it&#39;s pretty much always going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">the same motion it&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">same technique so a clue</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">a tool a tool is a clearly defined</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">for our purposes the way that i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">that word it&#39;s pretty obvious what a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">wrench</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">is it looks like a wrench it works like</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">a wrench it&#39;s a wrench right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t mistake it for a duck or</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t quack like a duck the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">technique is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">very precise so a technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">how does a technique work it</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can hone your technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">you you can make it more refined</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">you can the way that you become familiar</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">with the technique is that you get even</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">less wiggle room</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really precise it&#39;s ever more</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">refined</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">so you think about meditation as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got a tool</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">you apply your technique that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">and precise as well so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">examples of meditation techniques are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">like focusing on the breath</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">concentrate on the breath as object</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">ignore</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">the thought there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">wiggle room there</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">not a lot there&#39;s a little bit you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">like do you focus on the in-breath or</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">the out breath or the all</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">all of the breath but it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">honed</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you practice in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">further refine</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">that technique that&#39;s how your practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">develops</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">you narrow in on the sensation at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">tip of the nose</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">um or something like that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s ever more refined it&#39;s ever more</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">concentrated even less wiggle room</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s how tools and techniques work</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">your meditation can be a tool with which</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">apply a technique so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">now let&#39;s think about method a method</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">is not a tool a method in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">i&#39;m using this term</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">is a way it&#39;s a way to employ</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">a principle so i was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">came up with this um analogy</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">um a sort of very literal analogy which</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">is paddling</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">paddling being the principal so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">paddling like you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">canoe not paddling in a puddle that sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">of paddling</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">you you use a paddle so if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">your canoe and you&#39;re paddling in white</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">water down some rapids you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">be using the paddle in a very certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">you know it might be quite frenetic or</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s quite a light touch but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">all pretty chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">it&#39;s unpredictable there you are like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">paddling away</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">frantically trying to stay upright in</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">the water</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re employing the paddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">principle that&#39;s an aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">you&#39;re doing there in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">navigate your way through the white</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">so there you are paddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">if you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">canoeing across a very still lake</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">you know the paddling you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">paddling but the paddling is going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">very different still paddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">still paddling because the principle is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">the same you&#39;re using a flat</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">board at the end of a stick to generate</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">the force to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">guide a vessel</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">precision possible when you&#39;re paddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">on the lake but there&#39;s a lot of wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">room right</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot you can paddle very deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">and you can move forward quite fast or</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">you can use the power to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">to steer the vehicle in one way or</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">another you can go any which way you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">you can you can go backwards you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">still paddling</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">so as a principal paddling is highly</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">adaptable</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be a very precise fit</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">it&#39;s uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">like a wrench which is of a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">particular size and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">very particular application it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">and you can really you can change your</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">method and employ the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">paddling</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">you use a kayak not a canoe</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a different sort of a paddle</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">but you know the experience changes</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">still paddling</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">you take like one of those uh precarious</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">board things that people stand up on</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">and uh again very long sort of paddle</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">thing and you&#39;re moving yourself around</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">um on the water and still paddling</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">paddling still paddling</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s quite different same principle</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">different method so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:21.120" style="s2">where are we going with this so take a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">little moment now</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.120" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">maybe think about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">these two analogies</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">and how they&#39;re distinct and how they</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">reflect the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">tools that apply techniques methods that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">operate according to principles</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">like you know analogies are never</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">perfect but there&#39;s a distinction here</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">that i&#39;m pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">the distinction between different ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">of practicing different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">meditating different ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">of relating to life circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">when when meditation is your tool you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">you&#39;re applying your</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">precision technique maybe that&#39;s focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s concentration of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">when meditation is your method</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">you&#39;re employing your principle</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">so supposing supposing the principle</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to employ</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">in your meditation is um remaining</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">uninvolved remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.679" style="s2">so let&#39;s think about that if you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">sleepy</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.679" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">your eyes want to close your brain brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">is kind of you&#39;ve got brain fog and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of drowsy</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">remaining uninvolved that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">maintaining conscious aware</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">presence remains on remaining</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">uninvolved with the sleepy experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">of remaining uninvolved it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">feel a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">it&#39;s going to have a certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">quality certain sort of texture</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">to it and it&#39;s going to be defined</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">somewhat by a sort of sleepiness and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">sort of slight sort of tension with</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">sleepiness isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">and then the practice at that point is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">defined by the experience of remaining</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">uninvolved with</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">sleepiness so by contrast you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">you know if you if you&#39;ve got a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">different sort of meditation experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">if you say for example you can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">thinking about the film that you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">last night the remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">practice is going to be maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">presence by remaining uninvolved with</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">the film story with the visuals with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">memories with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">you know all of that activity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">going on it&#39;s going to feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">very different to remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">with sleepiness</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">the way you even employ that principle</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">might be quite different</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">so you know another example like if</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing little itchies and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">little spiders walking all over you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">that practice of maintaining conscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">presence and awareness without involving</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">the sensation of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">the you know without getting all</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">involved in that sensation</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">and wanting to do something about it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">know that&#39;s again it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">very different indeed so um</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">the difference here between meditation</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">as your tool</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">and meditation as your method like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">know when it&#39;s your tool</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">it really doesn&#39;t matter what else is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">going on you apply the technique</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s always the same technique</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">like everything else is a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">you apply that technique</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">and you further refine the the technique</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t stop focusing on the breath</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">you maintain your concentration you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">keeping it the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">when so when when meditation is your</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">method you&#39;re employing a principle you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">say you&#39;re employing this principle of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">the experience is shaped by that context</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">of uninvolvement so the context</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">the environment within which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">employing that principle</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">shapes the experience of what it is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">to employ the the principle doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">always mean the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s still the same principle like still</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">paddling still remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">paddling adapting to context shaped by</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">the context</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">using a spanner it&#39;s always the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">motion it&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">the same thing like righty-tighty</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">lefty-loosey is the thing isn&#39;t it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">the same focusing you just get better at</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">keep doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">so that is a way in which shine</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">remaining uninvolved is quite distinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">and quite different</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">to the way that we&#39;re using these terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">shamatha and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">focusing and concentration shine is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">highly nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">by comparison it&#39;s really so much wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">there so that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">not quite so easy to put your finger on</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">what you&#39;re supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">because you&#39;re what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">employing a principle</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">not applying a technique so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that automatically it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">only ever be intelligent right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">you can&#39;t get into this you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">doing the same thing and there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">of gradation</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s very easy to lose</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">the practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">when when you&#39;re practicing chine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">really easy to you know that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">going to keep happening you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">keep losing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">you&#39;re going to keep losing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of different to focus and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">concentration</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">and you know focus concentration</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">that um that technique can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">graduated in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">is less easy to do with remaining</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">and you can have you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">when you&#39;re using focusing technique you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">have a less sharp focus somehow and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">get better</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">at the focus becoming more sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">keen like that sort of precision tooling</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">analogy you just can&#39;t do that with</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">remaining uninvolved not so much anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s less graduated you tend to fall</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">into involvement</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">and then find on involvement again</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how it works</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">and then you know the the periods of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">uninvolvement with</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">whatever it is they start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">to lengthen once you become more</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">familiar and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">adept at applying or</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">employing that that principle</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">okay so so meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">meditation is an example of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">a method it&#39;s just it&#39;s one particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">that can employ a principle and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">remaining uninvolved that was an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">of a principle</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">but because it&#39;s a principle and not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">technique</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">like with paddling like with the you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">know paddling with the canoes all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">different canoes</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">all sorts of method can employ that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">and this can get broader and broader it</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">can become quite nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">so you can get to the point where you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">say it&#39;s the context that is the method</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">that defines the principle if that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">convoluted you can remain uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">you remain uninvolved when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">wrong on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">you can remain uninvolved when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">you know attempting to coerce you into</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">behaving in a particular way or you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">make you do or say something that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">want you to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">you can remain uninvolved when anger is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">arising</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">the definition is maintaining conscious</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like the definition is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">is awareness of the whole situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">without involvement that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">that&#39;s employing the principle so</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">going back to the technique yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">technique is really exclusive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">distinct</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">it&#39;s precise and you know some somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">conceptually abstract</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">as well it can look and be the same in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">any kind of context whereas employing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">principle is really context</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">dependent so that&#39;s another important</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">difference i think between</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">the principle of remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">and the technique of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">focusing remaining uninvolved it means</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">that the choice</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">the option for involvement is always</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">remaining uninvolved it&#39;s not separate</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">from involvement</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s defined by knowing and seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">the possibility for involvement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">always there</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s always there so the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">that you get used to that it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">easier that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">option becomes eventually it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">choice it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no pull in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">involvement</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">although the possibility of involvement</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">still always present</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s um that&#39;s like an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">principle and how the context</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">the context which is the method shapes</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">the principle</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">so if meditation is your method</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">you can employ the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">remaining uninvolved with whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">arises</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">and then once you get quite familiar and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">you get quite comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">with that it becomes possible to employ</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">different principles but um you know in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">in vajrayana practice a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">really do rely on this familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">remaining uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">and methods and principles kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">hand in hand as well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve said that the context defines how</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">the principle manifests</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">like what it you know what the what that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">texture is like what it looks and feels</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">remaining uninvolved with thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">stories you know it&#39;s kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">to remaining uninvolved with sleepiness</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">and the the principle defines the method</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">to some extent they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of inseparable in context</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t take a paddle up on a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">hike it&#39;s kind of it would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">incongruent</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">to employ paddling while you&#39;re hiking</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">just like you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">it would be incongruent to employ</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">renunciation of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">and and desire when you&#39;re engaging in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">romantic relationship with somebody it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">would be a misapplication</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">of principle</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">so yeah maybe i&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">how long have i been going on for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">while yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">um yeah i i was kind of as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">well you know the first reflection that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">came up is because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">the specifics of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">of practice um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">getting used to shine because coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">from this concentration for</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">place uh you know many of the sits are</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">very similar uh they you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">recreate the same experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">in some way um and uh and and the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">that i&#39;ve gotten comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">practicing shine the more i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">really interested like so on our we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">a slack channel and we always do the we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">do uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">some some people practice uh we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">this little practice log where we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">give a little update on you know how our</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">how our meditation went for the day</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">uh and the first thing i always write is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">the environment that i was in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">because that is kind of the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">context that defines</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">so much of the quality of that sit right</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">as before it was always like the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">context was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">hindrance or something to be overcome</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">yeah now that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">because i think in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">systems there&#39;s this ideal that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">would find a very very quiet space and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">think that actually can really help a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">when you&#39;re beginning to meditate but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">there is no</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">requisite</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a part of the um</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">is not a part of the tool of shamatha</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">you know it it&#39;s different in that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">that yeah you could find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">noisy environment you&#39;d still</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">apply the principle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">yeah and so your your sitting can have</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">sort of very different qualities at</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">different times and it can still be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">method yeah yeah radically it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">it brings a bit of interest as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">to me because that was one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">uh you know maintaining your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">there has to be some sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">interesting in your experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">and that was i think some of my early</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">shamatha experiences like i knew what it</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">was supposed to be it was already</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">predefined</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">um and if it was going as planned it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">exactly the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">but it kind of got it was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">hard to keep my</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">intention to stay with it because it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">it was not it was very</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">you know yeah this is what i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">was going to be now it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">surprising thing every time</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">something i&#39;m really curious about is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">whether um</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">whether you get more boredom in china</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">than you do in chalmetta</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">i you know i don&#39;t know because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">mostly coming from shinee</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">background but you know um</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">boredom has this kind of very particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">flavor</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">like it you know if you meditate for</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">long enough you&#39;re going to experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">boredom so i i sort of wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">because of the focus and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">concentration and shamatha that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">always got</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">something you know there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">something there i kind of wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">boredom is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">less of a feature i don&#39;t know yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">for sure i mean because</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">for me at least especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">beginning chine was very boring um</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.960" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">yeah i needed without a technique it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">like what am i supposed to be doing here</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">you know like is the definition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to do well yeah a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">people coming to china i think they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">experience that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">um you know what even is this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">what am i you know it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">nebulous it&#39;s much much more nebulous as</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">as a practice than you know and it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not systematized within itself in</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">some shamatha practices so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">there&#39;s this very um</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">clear clearly defined set of steps which</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">you can work through</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">which is you know that&#39;s very appealing</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">very appealing in some way</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s really heading in quite quite a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">different direction</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">and the experience that you have at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">end of that is going to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">quite different as well yeah well and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">i would say this also does kind of speak</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">um you know the the technique-heavy</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">can be i think it&#39;s very common uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">especially with with broad teachings</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">um because you have to generalize and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">and try and replicate a similar</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">environment so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">you know know where they&#39;re at uh where</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">so much more of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">of the practice that i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">ever since moving to more of roger on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">relies on getting feedback and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">yeah talking to people and getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">especially somebody who has more because</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so using your personal</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">life and circumstances and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">your personality and in some way</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">and you know personality is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">very much personality and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">really are the path</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">aspects of buddhist tantra so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s very different flavor in</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">in that sense yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of curious just to call to call</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">yet i don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">starting chine than me which</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">speaks to the the how much variability</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">there can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">yeah i i i probably the opposite for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">actually i</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">i i feel like i went through</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">just terrible long long stretches of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">boredom</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">in in shamatha and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">it just it was interminable and uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">so i i feel like i kind of maybe beat it</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">out of me or something you know i get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">the point now where</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">i feel like i can find almost any aspect</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">of experience at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:07.119" style="s2">moderately interesting so that&#39;s helped</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">a little bit with that with you name</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.119" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">yeah maybe boredom&#39;s just kind of par</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">for the course in</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">meditation yeah and one of my uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">earliest experiences of what they call</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">experience that came through sticking</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">with boredom it was like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">you know really really instant like</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">instantaneous sudden change of state</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">into mental clarity and it kind of felt</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">like i really remember it because it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">it was just so different to anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">else that i&#39;d experienced at that time i</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">sticking with it and it was like a veil</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:04.839" style="s2">lifting somehow in terms of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">experience there</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">yeah and to put into context napa would</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">and i i guess i want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">more connected to the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">uninvolved and i don&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">quite feel that right</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">so yeah i see what you&#39;re you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">at there&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">distinct difference between</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">renouncing rejecting um</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">having some sort of separation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">barrier and wall</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">there and the choice to remain</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">uninvolved which you know i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">about having this</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">always present potential for involvement</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">the connection is always there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">there&#39;s still a connection when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">remain uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">you see maybe so take an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">as an example so you feel the arising</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">so there are different choices that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">have when the sensation of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">emotion arises and you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">different things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">do in response and you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">you could just completely ignore that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">push the sensation away</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">stop feeling the sensation you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">control that sensation so that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">subsides</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">that is that is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m referring to with remaining</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">uninvolved</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">remaining uninvolved doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">involved in that kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">i mean you know if you&#39;re pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">pushing your sensation away you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">actively ignoring it you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">involved in some way you&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">pretending not</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">you know you know what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">you allow the sensation to arise and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">choice is available if it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">and if you&#39;re connected with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">sensation then choice is always</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">and the choice is maybe to not express</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:26.839" style="s2">so you&#39;re feeling the sensation but</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">you&#39;re maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.839" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">showing and expressing that sensation</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">intentionally outward in connection with</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">so you&#39;re remaining uninvolved with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">sensation but you still have a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">connection with that sensation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">still there</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">the potential to do all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">whatever is there but you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">letting it do its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">yeah letting the sensation do sensation</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">and mutate and and evolve</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">and do all kinds of things i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">way that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">get into these um habitual expression</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">or repression or you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">control of emotion or or</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">manipulation manipulation this this kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">projection of emotion onto everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">that&#39;s just as much um</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">you know that&#39;s kind of the flip side of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">of repressing it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">giving full reign to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">quality of your experience um</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">so you know those are both involvement</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">in some way</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">so remaining uninvolved allows the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">sensation of the emotion just to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">stay around and be there um but</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">you know when i&#39;m language is so hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">with chine because as as</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">i said it&#39;s it&#39;s very nebulous um</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:07.599" style="s2">and yet like as i&#39;ve practiced more and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">more i&#39;ve almost come to see that there</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.599" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">a flavor to involvement um</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">and involvement is you know well so so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">even chine is the first of these four</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">building up to zogen practice and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">zogchen talks a lot about how</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">mind is always kind of manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">overlaying</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">judging uh putting things in reference</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">um it&#39;s always kind of it&#39;s an overlay</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">on your experience so it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">manipulating the situation in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">um and when ordinary experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">ordinary experience yeah um and so and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">and remaining uninvolved leads to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">uh the state this nepa eventually</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">um that it really just it there there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">categorization there&#39;s no preference</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">there&#39;s no judgment there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">um agenda you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">just allowing things to be very much</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">exactly the way they are yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid to say that just because i</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">know that cliche is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">rife with you know letting things be as</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">they are being in the present but</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">i mean another way of saying it is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">allowing space</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:19.760" style="s2">around whatever arises whether that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">yeah right this is really important for</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">for practice as you know</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">and creating stuff and doing stuff and</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">ask your question sure so</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">um i was thinking about the the wrench</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">example um and in my mind it related to</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">i thought of hammering since i&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">bunch of hammering</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">um and i was thinking about um</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">last summer when i was dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">wooden</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">um nails instead of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">metal nails and that you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">basically the same sort of action but</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">still was a little bit of context</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">modification in there um</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">you know maybe not not as uh my</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">hammering had to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">precise not as</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">high magnitude or what have you so it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">sounds it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">one of the differences you&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">to is sort of a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:50.079" style="s2">of the amount of context adaptation that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">you need i think so</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.079" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">yeah okay yeah yeah since it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">almost any tool use there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">slight</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">um attention to context and modification</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">but then it it does feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">qualitatively different thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">to have sort of like context</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">modification be</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">the almost like the the entire flavor of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">the activity you might say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s very nicely put thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve been you know i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">quite a bit how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">express the experience recently</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">the experience of the difference and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">yeah i think you said that very nicely</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">um and i think also there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">about the direction</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">in which you&#39;re heading with each of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">these like</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">the the direction you&#39;re heading when</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;re hammering is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">you just get better and better at</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">hammering</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">and and sort of increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">able to be more precise</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">and i think something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">you get better at nebulosity the better</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">at remaining uninvolved you get better</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">indefinable um wiggly</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">gray areas somehow yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">and the direction you&#39;re heading is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">expansive and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">with the hammering the direction or you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">know with meditation as a tool the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">direction that you&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">is really pretty specific</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">you know there are some very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">defined end goals</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">one of which is cessation right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:26.559" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">there&#39;s even quite a pretty distinct um</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.559" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">scoping of awareness that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">each one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">when i&#39;m focusing like very narrow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">on on breath meditation for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s almost like going</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">to a single point whereas other types of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">more nebulous meditations feel like</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">they&#39;re entertaining more and more of my</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">and eventually what you&#39;re doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">the more shamatha oriented more what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">call sutrick approach is that you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">honing in so much that you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">where there&#39;s an explosion into</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">separate entirely separate uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">if you like thank you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">and that is very different that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">very different from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">uh the approaches within vajrayana which</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">you&#39;re moving towards an experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">is is never going to be clearly defined</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">it will it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">about congruent activity in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">it&#39;s about relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">what is arising in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t lead to</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.319" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">a point of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">it i would say maybe it leads to a point</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">not a point it doesn&#39;t lead to a point</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">it really leads to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">a scope or a sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">fullness completeness complete</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:13.359" style="s2">congruent congruent apprehension it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">not like saying that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">perfect information</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s more um</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">full engaged presence in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">life in the relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">present moment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">and i guess appreciate it and and um</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">more of a kind of uh uh vajrayana thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:40.400" style="s2">you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:42.079" style="s2">vegetarian is so much defined on this</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.400" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">play between emptiness and form and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">the wholeness is the integration or</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">kind of yoking if we&#39;re yogi&#39;s of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">dynamics of the the pattern and the um</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">and the nebulosity</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">um and chine is quite you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">this is a very the beginning of the base</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">the base</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s the ground so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">to be looking at chine a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">in these series we&#39;ll kind of come back</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">to that as the uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">example of quite often</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">yeah so yeah gina is really getting a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">real familiarity and comfort with</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:21.359" style="s2">nebulosity so that then you can learn to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">integrate and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.359" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">allow the form to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">and so it is kind of slightly artificial</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:28.720" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">you know that&#39;s something that nat turn</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">rinpoche always i remember him saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not an ordinary natural</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">state it is something that you are</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">intentionally cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not um you know in sub 10 there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">this phrase the natural state</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not um well it depends</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">what perspective you know it can be an</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">aspect of that but it is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">an ordinary everyday state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">something that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">cultivate and become more familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">and then eventually it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">arises</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">naturally in different circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">and i do think that i get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">especially from spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">in the with the more</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">sutra</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">perspectives i think we we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:19.839" style="s2">transcendent might be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">broad uh ranging but yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.839" end="00:57:23.440" style="s2">transcendence is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">is the result isn&#39;t it or the intended</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.440" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">result in</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">that more sutured context you could say</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">the most uh constructed is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.200" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">no thought that&#39;s arising</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">when you&#39;re in this state and i think a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">transcendent uh uh approaches see that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">as like that&#39;s the goal like that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">everything&#39;s perfect is when there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.839" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:35.359" style="s2">is this directly uh related to the empty</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">element of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.359" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">the experiential</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">um yeah like the empty the empty aspect</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">of whatever is arising has to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">in contact with it right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.000" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">talking about an experience</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:54.480" style="s2">here rather than you know a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">2 000 years of buddhism is</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.480" end="01:03:59.119" style="s2">arguing about emptiness and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">that yeah i guess we could say nebulas</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.119" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">what it is yeah nebulosity is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">a really great</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:07.119" style="s2">way of bringing the understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.119" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">and the qualitative understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:14.319" style="s2">kind of emptiness and meditation</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">understanding that as</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.319" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">nebulosity in your daily activities is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:22.559" style="s2">one way to have a connection with your</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:22.559" style="s2">meditation there</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">i did see one other uh question from</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:30.799" style="s2">michael</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">uh this might be a quick one the thought</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.799" end="01:04:35.760" style="s2">free state what is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">word thoughts or um so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.760" end="01:04:39.039" style="s2">and this is yeah no it&#39;s anything that</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">arises in um</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.039" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">in in your mind</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s ideation uh visual</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">stuff that comes up not so much talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">about bodily sensations so you allow</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:57.280" style="s2">body sensation to be as it is and remain</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">uninvolved with that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:02.319" style="s2">and that can you know the more you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">practice gna that does subside a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.319" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">bit and it sort of mutates</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">as well so it becomes sort of quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:11.440" style="s2">pleasurable sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2">um but you&#39;re mostly we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.440" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">thought-free state</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">thought the tibetan word is nam tog</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">which is just stuff that arises</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">so whatever arises you remain uninvolved</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:28.319" style="s2">for the most part when you start</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">meditating and practicing that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.319" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">for most people that is thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">and then yes you become used to having</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:46.079" style="s2">density of thought then</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">you begin to notice all the other kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.079" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">of stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:50.880" style="s2">goes on and you know i sometimes wonder</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.880" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">that what happens is that as the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">the verbal density dissipates somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">it actually allows a bit more space for</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">other stuff to arise as well so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">they&#39;re you know very</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">well documented well known phases that</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">do move through in meditation but i</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:16.559" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say that these are</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:16.559" style="s2">prescriptive</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.880" end="01:06:21.039" style="s2">you know some people don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">verbal</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.039" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">mental activity some people have an</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.039" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">outside i&#39;m assuming we might go back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">get a little bit more on the method</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:54.839" style="s2">uh uh or something yeah</p>

<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">presenting here</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.280" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">in relation to your own lives and your</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.920" style="s2">own practice</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.920" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:12.799" style="s2">is this relevant is this not relevant</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">for me at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.799" end="01:08:18.560" style="s2">how might this apply um you know just to</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">have a little exploration of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">material while it&#39;s still really fresh</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">and then you know if anything arises and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:30.719" style="s2">you have questions or</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">insights or anything that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">share we can come back</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">for a bit more of a larger group</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.359" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">discussion and exploration so should we</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.159" end="01:08:43.679" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:44.080" style="s2">now yeah i think so i had one quick</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.679" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.080" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">this was something that came up but i</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.199" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to mention it um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">i thought it might be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">because maybe there&#39;s some people here</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t meditating on a regular basis but</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">the interesting thing here is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2">similar to what we covered in our last</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">stoa session</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:04.159" style="s2">there is kind of a general technique or</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">method or view that gets employed in</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.159" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">informal ways throughout our life too so</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">the things that came to my mind was like</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">how we deal with our emotions</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.480" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">um you know maybe especially the ones</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">that are difficult</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">um did you you know i i thought maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">the that we could make a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">correlation with with the method of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">dealing with emotion in just day-to-day</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">life so that we could</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:27.440" style="s2">so folks that don&#39;t have the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:28.799" style="s2">background could talk about their</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.440" end="01:09:32.159" style="s2">informal experience as well</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.799" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great idea yep</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.159" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">yeah i mean basically you can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.560" style="s2">whatever arises as well i mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.560" end="01:09:43.359" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:45.199" style="s2">um helpful regarding</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.359" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">employing vajrayana practice or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.199" end="01:09:50.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s different then you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">follow that lead yeah gotcha okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.000" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">any any questions before we do break out</p>
