<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">years has ended up in the bad place</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">because of this unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">that everything we do and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">really we&#39;re the ones choosing it we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">bar you have all of the ripple effects</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">at that choice makes and real ripple</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">effects that aren&#39;t necessarily you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">going to heaven or hell but like there</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">we don&#39;t necessarily have other any</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">other options like with a cell phone and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:14.569" style="s2">we don&#39;t necessarily we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:14.569" style="s2">necessarily have all of the information</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">to be able to make choices and even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.600" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">you do you&#39;re one person so even if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:27.240" style="s2">make perfect choices no one else is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">going to because it&#39;s too complex and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.240" end="00:02:31.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of what because I am Gd I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">like I need more information I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.770" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">make a decision I very much can see what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:39.240" style="s2">we can create together which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">consequence of our actions not so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.240" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">you have to sit there indecisive between</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:44.580" style="s2">to buy this tomato or talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:46.860" style="s2">tomato this one&#39;s negative 500 points</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.580" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">this one&#39;s positive 10,000 points that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.860" end="00:02:53.820" style="s2">kind of a no-brainer but it&#39;s seen that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">point system actually being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.820" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">okay what is in alignment with my values</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">and what are the consequences of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">action and then the person can choose</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:04.590" style="s2">and when there aren&#39;t good options when</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay negative 500 or negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.590" end="00:03:07.770" style="s2">450 well this one&#39;s about animals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:09.630" style="s2">this one&#39;s towards people and I care</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.770" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">more about people that animals I&#39;ll pick</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.630" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">the one that&#39;s gonna hurt animals</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">whereas we together can create okay well</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">if there isn&#39;t a tomato on the market</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">that isn&#39;t negative and isn&#39;t hurting</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">people we can create that together we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">can create a tomato I mean it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.050" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">tomato it&#39;s like if you grow tomatoes in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:32.550" style="s2">your backyard it does not have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">consequence and so we could start a farm</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.550" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">that&#39;s like okay we&#39;re do we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:38.670" style="s2">pay farmers as well or sorry at the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">agricultural workers well or we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.670" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">going to be the agricultural workers</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to use pesticides when</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2">we do we&#39;re going to make that decision</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:47.670" style="s2">together so that we can weigh the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">trade-off and say okay well either we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.670" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">just this crop gets destroyed or we use</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:53.790" style="s2">this pesticide one time here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:56.580" style="s2">science behind this pesticide and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.790" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">make a choice and again that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.580" end="00:03:59.550" style="s2">everyone making that choice would be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">people who are part owners in that farm</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.550" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">people who are using that farm to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">their tomatoes from that are part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:14.310" style="s2">that democratic system not all people</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">everywhere little complex but um yeah I</p>
