<p begin="00:00:01.610" end="00:00:08.719" style="s2">hi there in this second video of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.250" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">series what is the Magellan course I</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.719" end="00:00:14.280" style="s2">want to talk about some distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">that we set up in the first video and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.280" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">those are the distinctions between what</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">we might term post-modernism and post</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">post modernism whereas I have it here a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">post poem in these things these</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">distinctions are valuable not so much in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">terms of the content that the magellan</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">course is most interested in but in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">terms of the trajectory away from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">types of thinking being and learning and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">action logics that are currently either</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">being utilized for being moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">from what the Magellan course is most</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:04.610" style="s2">interested in and so in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">first video we talked about a frontier</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.610" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">and everything we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">today is on the near side of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:19.250" style="s2">frontier so these will be distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">that are set up to help us understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.250" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">what the Magellan course is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">move beyond so we&#39;re trying to move even</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:32.210" style="s2">beyond post post-modernism or postpone</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:32.210" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.080" end="00:01:41.080" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">so if we look at what you make a grid of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:16.970" style="s2">some of these distinctions and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:16.970" style="s2">want to do here is say that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.580" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">post post modern version of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">aspects that we&#39;re going to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">would be the post modern version we will</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:46.650" style="s2">look at the post modern version as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">reaction against what came before so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">this would be what it&#39;s reacting to in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:54.269" style="s2">many cases that&#39;s the modern version but</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">we want to highlight that the post</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.269" end="00:03:03.209" style="s2">modern is in many respects a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">against what came before so those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.209" end="00:03:08.989" style="s2">some of the ways we&#39;re going to set this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">up the post modern to the post</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.989" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">postmodern is not so much a reaction but</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">in general there&#39;s this process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">building on some of the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">post modern into a new integrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">post-postmodern so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">highlight that in general the post</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">modern was a reaction is reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">against the previous forms and the post</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">post modern movement is more integrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:50.900" style="s2">so that is a first distinction we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:56.850" style="s2">make the post modern was in general</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.900" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">reactive whereas the post post mal tends</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.850" end="00:04:07.010" style="s2">to be more concentrate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:10.110" style="s2">integration so you hear words as</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.010" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">transcendence include the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.110" end="00:04:15.930" style="s2">whereas the modern is the postmodern is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:20.780" style="s2">trying to make more of an actual reacted</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.930" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">break against what has come before and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.780" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">so people like gentlemen will say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">the postmodern has overstated the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:44.070" style="s2">reaction and the post-postmodern is now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:46.290" style="s2">trying to be synthetic to reclaim some</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.070" end="00:04:52.890" style="s2">of what has gone before so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.290" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">first distinction the other categories</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.890" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">that I want to look at is a category we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:04.650" style="s2">could call what&#39;s the different views</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:09.030" style="s2">the overall view that these different</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.650" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">mindsets but operating from Emily I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:16.890" style="s2">would say that the post homo view as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:23.970" style="s2">many of you will not be surprised this</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.890" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">perspectival so culminating with Ken</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.970" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">Wilber we&#39;ve been able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">identify in that the perspectives from</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:37.200" style="s2">which all these different views and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">methodologies are arising in these</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.200" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">perspectives this mapping of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">perspectival domains isn&#39;t attempt to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:53.700" style="s2">integrative and in synthetic so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:59.690" style="s2">move build on the post post Mott the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.700" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">postmodern view which was relatively</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">that there were many views and they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:08.610" style="s2">all relative to each other in the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:13.169" style="s2">the integrative or synthetic move and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.610" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">postpone Oh built on that the saying yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.169" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.210" style="s2">they&#39;re all relatively but they can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:24.389" style="s2">contextualized by this map of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.210" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">perspectives this relative aspect we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.389" end="00:06:35.850" style="s2">see was a reaction against absolutism so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:41.100" style="s2">prior to the understanding that views</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.850" end="00:06:46.440" style="s2">our perspectival which accounts for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.100" end="00:06:50.610" style="s2">fact that there seem to be relative is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.440" end="00:06:55.410" style="s2">reaction against the fact that opinions</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.610" end="00:07:00.510" style="s2">and knowledge --is and worldviews are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.410" end="00:07:03.630" style="s2">not absolutely real for all trains and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.510" end="00:07:08.580" style="s2">so perspectival is a map of the we could</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.630" end="00:07:12.330" style="s2">say the frames of reference and you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.580" end="00:07:17.430" style="s2">this in science as well as in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:19.800" style="s2">humanities this brings up to the domain</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.430" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">let&#39;s say I will call it just the domain</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:30.020" style="s2">of knowledge and we want to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:34.740" style="s2">post pomo or the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.020" end="00:07:40.949" style="s2">understanding or approach to knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.740" end="00:07:44.520" style="s2">and in general the the treatment of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.949" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">knowledge domain is through what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.520" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">might call on junctions or methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:59.250" style="s2">and this relates to perspectival so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:02.010" style="s2">different injunctions will elicit</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.250" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">different perspective of frames</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.010" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">different methodologies will elicit</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:12.750" style="s2">different types of evidence or data the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:19.250" style="s2">move then the synthetic move then into</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.750" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">here would be to be transdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.250" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">through the methods or injunction so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:32.620" style="s2">have methodological pluralism Intel</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">methodological pluralism that&#39;s we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.620" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">that recent approach this methodological</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:53.310" style="s2">pluralism was built on the notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">hermeneutic circle and shared discourse</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.310" end="00:09:04.630" style="s2">that emerged during the postmodern term</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:15.490" style="s2">and that was a reaction against a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.630" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">strict empiricism we can then look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.490" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">what we might call well how do the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">different views receive or find meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.570" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">in the modern age the general way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.579" end="00:09:45.790" style="s2">find meaning was to assume that it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">discoverable that it was out there as</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.790" end="00:09:51.250" style="s2">something ontologically real as</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:54.100" style="s2">something constant in nature as</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.250" end="00:09:57.970" style="s2">something an absolute an empirically</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.100" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">real and it could be discovered as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.970" end="00:10:04.630" style="s2">reaction against that the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">said modern movement of meaning as being</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.630" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">invincible</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">so you weren&#39;t so much discovering</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.329" end="00:10:15.399" style="s2">meaning as inventing it with different</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">methodologies by taking on different</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.399" end="00:10:22.540" style="s2">perspectives and frames not only was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2">inventive also we have this kind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.540" end="00:10:32.529" style="s2">of being constructed that meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:36.579" style="s2">constructed when that gets incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.529" end="00:10:40.400" style="s2">to this concept of taking on different</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.579" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2">perspectives being</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.400" end="00:10:48.370" style="s2">methodological II pluralistic being</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:53.950" style="s2">synthetic and interpretive then the turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">it from postmodern to an or recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.950" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">understanding is that meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:11.290" style="s2">actionable and so you start to see words</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:17.300" style="s2">such like enactment an enactment Theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.290" end="00:11:19.610" style="s2">an enactment unfolds all these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.300" end="00:11:22.550" style="s2">these integrated concepts so that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.610" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">enact meaning through different</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.550" end="00:11:29.930" style="s2">injunctions for example so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">another move between these three</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.930" end="00:11:42.500" style="s2">different views this has been also</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:47.590" style="s2">related to what a lot of people talk</p>
