<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:52.460" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.460" style="s2">blades edge of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.510" end="00:01:04.790" style="s2">so just a little check-in about where</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.059" end="00:01:07.250" style="s2">I&#39;m at today</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.790" end="00:01:11.030" style="s2">yesterday I had a very difficult day I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.250" end="00:01:13.369" style="s2">woke up and I watched the new movie the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.030" end="00:01:15.880" style="s2">planet of the humans has anybody watched</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.369" end="00:01:15.880" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:23.710" style="s2">I realized that it must have been at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.330" end="00:01:28.600" style="s2">low you know I didn&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.710" end="00:01:31.870" style="s2">resources to watch it usually I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.600" end="00:01:36.670" style="s2">maintain a certain amount of empathic</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.870" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">distance yeah so that film really</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.670" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">affected me and I was fortunate to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:45.850" style="s2">four community calls yesterday where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:48.340" style="s2">helped each other or the community</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.850" end="00:01:51.660" style="s2">helped me kind of process that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.340" end="00:01:56.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.660" end="00:02:01.990" style="s2">hangover for me today and we&#39;ll see if</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.500" end="00:02:04.390" style="s2">that weaves into what we are going to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.990" end="00:02:09.580" style="s2">today so we&#39;ve started this series last</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.390" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">week about a new way of thinking a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.580" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">way of trying to think through the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:19.900" style="s2">and get very clear one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.900" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">information ecology is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.150" end="00:02:30.820" style="s2">it&#39;s really crazy so how can we step</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:33.400" style="s2">back start thinking from first</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.820" end="00:02:35.950" style="s2">principles and go forward so we did a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.400" end="00:02:39.880" style="s2">metaphysical exercise just to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.950" end="00:02:42.850" style="s2">the bones of this way of thinking last</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.880" end="00:02:45.790" style="s2">week and if you weren&#39;t here last week</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.850" end="00:02:48.850" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter you&#39;ll you&#39;ll get the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.790" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">sense of it with a new exercise it turns</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.850" end="00:02:54.310" style="s2">out that the closer you get to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:56.320" style="s2">you know we did we derived the universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.310" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">last week that actually happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.320" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">easier than thinking about real issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:05.650" style="s2">so the closer we get to actual lived</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:10.540" style="s2">experience the more nuanced the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.650" end="00:03:12.820" style="s2">difficult it is to cut through the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:18.610" style="s2">or to find you know weed seeds that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:23.620" style="s2">actually very useful so we also talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.610" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">about how when we think in these ways we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.620" end="00:03:28.750" style="s2">are building something what I call a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:31.030" style="s2">cognitive widget so the cognitive widget</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.750" end="00:03:33.210" style="s2">for the universe had those three parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.030" end="00:03:36.610" style="s2">they need to be some</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.210" end="00:03:40.990" style="s2">they need to be self differentiation in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.610" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">their participation and today in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.990" end="00:03:45.820" style="s2">next week we&#39;re going to work with</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">cognitive widgets the ACOG the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.820" end="00:03:55.910" style="s2">widgets trust power and something I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.660" end="00:03:59.420" style="s2">called action threshold</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.910" end="00:04:02.750" style="s2">um and these this is the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.420" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">widget for self-organized collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.750" end="00:04:08.450" style="s2">work right so we know for a team to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.490" style="s2">together there has to be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.450" end="00:04:13.310" style="s2">trust there has to become some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.490" end="00:04:16.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a negotiation of power and roles</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.310" end="00:04:20.150" style="s2">and who gets to do what and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.810" end="00:04:22.570" style="s2">action thresholds you might work as on</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.150" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">consensus consensus a very high action</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.570" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">threshold if you need everyone to agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">if you have a lot of trust in the system</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">then you can have people making</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:36.740" style="s2">decisions on their own action thresholds</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:40.670" style="s2">go down so we want to look so why is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:44.350" style="s2">this important because we suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.670" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">as we try to move to decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.350" end="00:04:51.760" style="s2">society as we try to build emerging</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">cultures from you know micro</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.760" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">solidarity&#39;s from these little we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:05:02.420" style="s2">to kind of reassess what it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:07.040" style="s2">a human collective because we our habits</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.420" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">are conditioned by our the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.040" end="00:05:11.480" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been raised in right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:13.880" style="s2">trying to get back to a source code and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.480" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">build from there trying to get down to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.880" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">first principle thinking around these</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">things so that&#39;s why the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">hopefully don&#39;t matter so today we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:28.490" style="s2">going to start with trust and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:32.630" style="s2">going to show you this actually maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.490" end="00:05:36.770" style="s2">could do it right here you need a piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.630" end="00:05:39.790" style="s2">of paper and you&#39;re going to just draw</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:39.790" style="s2">out something</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:45.660" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.880" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.289" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">like do another one that&#39;s one okay here</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.660" end="00:06:13.040" style="s2">oh sorry about this I had it set up and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:13.040" style="s2">now I don&#39;t have it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.830" end="00:06:18.890" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:23.639" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.889" end="00:06:33.699" style="s2">okay so you want to draw something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.289" end="00:06:33.699" style="s2">looks like this sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:40.030" style="s2">so can you can you see this here</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.849" end="00:06:44.970" style="s2">and basically you&#39;re just drawing three</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.530" end="00:06:48.539" style="s2">concentric you&#39;re drawing some</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.970" end="00:06:54.810" style="s2">concentric circles and the dot in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.539" end="00:06:59.819" style="s2">middle is you and then the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.810" end="00:07:07.590" style="s2">circle next closest to you are people</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.819" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">who you trust the most and the people in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.590" end="00:07:13.650" style="s2">the next circle are people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:16.110" style="s2">quite make this inner sanctum and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.650" end="00:07:18.840" style="s2">people out here I mean some people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.110" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">many many layers I just usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:24.569" style="s2">represent it with the three the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:27.659" style="s2">out here are people that you trust but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.569" end="00:07:29.669" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t know all right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.659" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of they&#39;re kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.669" end="00:07:34.979" style="s2">different zone right you you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">find that there&#39;s different mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.979" end="00:07:38.849" style="s2">so you know you don&#39;t have to put these</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:41.129" style="s2">little guys there but you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.849" end="00:07:44.099" style="s2">have your in the middle these are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.129" end="00:07:48.690" style="s2">people you trust the most and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.099" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">gonna write out some categories about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.690" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">this these are the people that for some</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:54.840" style="s2">reason I mean you trust them but you you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:58.250" style="s2">just know there&#39;s a difference there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.840" end="00:08:00.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a boundary some kind of boundary</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.250" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">you might have another layer of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.719" end="00:08:05.729" style="s2">that&#39;s fine you can you can do as many</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:09.000" style="s2">layers that you need to represent your</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.729" end="00:08:12.090" style="s2">internal compass this is your chart we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.000" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">would call a trust network but then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.090" end="00:08:17.969" style="s2">want one out here which are people you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know that for some reason you feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.969" end="00:08:22.590" style="s2">you trust and what I mean by people you</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:25.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.590" end="00:08:30.330" style="s2">could be people like me but it also</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.650" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">could be people like you know I trust I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.330" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">don&#39;t Bill Gates or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:39.060" style="s2">you know I trust Madonna or Lady Gaga</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.419" end="00:08:42.990" style="s2">something like that so they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.060" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">they&#39;re more symbolic in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.990" end="00:08:49.240" style="s2">trust network than they are you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:51.370" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually engaged with them</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.240" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">so you just want to take a few moments</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.370" end="00:08:56.050" style="s2">and build out your truck now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:09:00.220" style="s2">things about this is you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.050" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">measuring if people are trustworthy this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.220" end="00:09:07.050" style="s2">is not about the people you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:10.510" style="s2">like that what trust is is Trust is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:12.550" style="s2">emergent pattern that emanates from you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.510" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">through your many many many micro</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.550" end="00:09:23.830" style="s2">relationships in ordinary everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:25.330" style="s2">itself it shapes itself so you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.830" end="00:09:27.520" style="s2">sometimes you can have an experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.330" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">that I trust somebody really well and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.520" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">they really trust that person but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.440" style="s2">don&#39;t trust that person so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:36.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not whether this person is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.440" end="00:09:38.500" style="s2">trustworthy this is not the it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.700" end="00:09:41.529" style="s2">judgment like that we just want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.500" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2">illustrate that there&#39;s an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.529" end="00:09:49.649" style="s2">pattern that is a natural part of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:49.649" style="s2">a human being</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.019" end="00:09:52.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:09:58.540" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:09.080" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s some symbolic deep symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.950" end="00:10:15.230" style="s2">trusting what we have in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.080" end="00:10:16.490" style="s2">society we are just writing names that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">correct yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.490" end="00:10:20.540" style="s2">you could put initials you know just so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.730" style="s2">you cuz because if we make it specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.540" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">then you get more information out of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.730" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.550" end="00:10:29.610" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.950" end="00:10:33.010" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.360" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">and of course notice that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.360" end="00:10:47.100" style="s2">trusting your body some of you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">actually know that&#39;s not true some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.100" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">you might might be more of a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">exercise but there are some compass</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.590" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">that is evaluating these</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:05.790" style="s2">these these levels it&#39;s what really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re after we&#39;re after what</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.790" end="00:11:10.430" style="s2">is this compass</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:15.970" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.430" end="00:11:18.230" style="s2">benita yes does it yeah someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.970" end="00:11:20.630" style="s2">mentioned in the chat trust in what</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.230" end="00:11:23.960" style="s2">context and I I&#39;m also wondering now on</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.630" end="00:11:27.170" style="s2">come on people if I think like like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.960" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">someone I trust to honor and respect me</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.170" end="00:11:29.690" style="s2">but I know that their information is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.050" style="s2">going to be bomb</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.690" end="00:11:35.060" style="s2">this is what we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.050" end="00:11:36.950" style="s2">okay there&#39;s multiple contexts so just</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.060" end="00:11:40.910" style="s2">put down so what you&#39;re going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.950" end="00:11:43.640" style="s2">lines for is to kind of we and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.910" end="00:11:46.700" style="s2">have to do that we alone but we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.640" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">to try to figure out whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.700" end="00:11:51.770" style="s2">just one context or you have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">contexts like and and this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.770" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to learn there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:59.990" style="s2">going on right there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:03.800" style="s2">and so some people there&#39;s not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.990" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">some people are very strong a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.800" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">principles and that&#39;s that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:14.930" style="s2">reality too so this is what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">to talk about as a group because we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:22.820" style="s2">take we think Trust is a thing or you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:25.430" style="s2">know coaches teach it and it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.820" end="00:12:29.290" style="s2">much going on and you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.430" end="00:12:31.490" style="s2">not to teach what you think Trust is I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.290" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">did this once the first time I did it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.490" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">was in Berlin outside of Berlin and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:39.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t even start the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:41.779" style="s2">and someone said well that&#39;s easy the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.950" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">families in the middle and the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.779" end="00:12:47.510" style="s2">people are in this on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:51.410" style="s2">someone said none of my family makes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.510" end="00:12:54.259" style="s2">middle circle so there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.410" end="00:12:56.279" style="s2">in the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.259" end="00:12:58.339" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.279" end="00:12:58.339" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:05.750" style="s2">so start to write those of you that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:09.320" style="s2">noticing context start to write out some</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.750" end="00:13:12.589" style="s2">of the context that you see your you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.320" end="00:13:14.300" style="s2">sliding context depending upon your</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.589" end="00:13:17.480" style="s2">thinking about someone who has the keys</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.300" end="00:13:19.990" style="s2">to the office versus somebody else in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.480" end="00:13:19.990" style="s2">different situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.810" end="00:13:25.870" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:30.220" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:30.220" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.209" end="00:13:33.269" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.699" end="00:13:37.759" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.779" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.779" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:04.950" style="s2">okay I&#39;m just gonna share the diagram</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.460" end="00:14:11.670" style="s2">again somebody hadn&#39;t seen it you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.950" end="00:14:14.760" style="s2">the diagram now it&#39;s really just</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:17.490" style="s2">concentric circles you&#39;re here in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.760" end="00:14:21.180" style="s2">middle this is your inner trust sanctum</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.490" end="00:14:23.580" style="s2">your your closest trust zone and other</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.180" end="00:14:25.200" style="s2">people you trust notice how you make</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.580" end="00:14:27.660" style="s2">this boundary what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.200" end="00:14:30.330" style="s2">notice context so these are all maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.660" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">people you trust but they&#39;re trusted in</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.330" end="00:14:35.340" style="s2">different contexts and then these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:39.750" style="s2">people that you trust but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.340" end="00:14:41.970" style="s2">so they&#39;re really really function more</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.750" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">symbolically like someone said I trust</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.970" end="00:14:47.700" style="s2">Keanu Reeves and I get it you know like</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.250" style="s2">like you get it right because he took</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.700" end="00:14:51.960" style="s2">the what the right pill was I forget</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.250" end="00:15:14.670" style="s2">which color the one the right one the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.960" end="00:15:16.070" style="s2">correct pill is but okay so we can now</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.670" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna open it up for some</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.070" end="00:15:26.820" style="s2">discussion some people for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:29.880" style="s2">realize they&#39;re in a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.820" end="00:15:31.470" style="s2">situation that they have more trust with</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.880" end="00:15:33.390" style="s2">more people they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.470" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">then the people actually know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.390" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">very precarious way to live your life</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.080" end="00:15:51.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always have to be people oh you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.820" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">might say how trust in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.030" end="00:15:58.490" style="s2">scientific principles or nature or</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:16:02.270" style="s2">something of that nature this is people</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.490" end="00:16:02.270" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.500" end="00:16:16.130" style="s2">I was thinking the same thing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:19.580" style="s2">institutions or collections of people it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.130" end="00:16:22.220" style="s2">gets to be an interesting edge case yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.580" end="00:16:26.090" style="s2">so there&#39;s a version of this diagram</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.220" end="00:16:29.960" style="s2">where you&#39;d what you do is you can let</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.090" end="00:16:33.740" style="s2">so so if you know like you trust this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.960" end="00:16:35.810" style="s2">whole there&#39;s 12 people in this company</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.740" end="00:16:42.050" style="s2">you trust them all you can just put them</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.810" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">12 at this company you know saying but</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.050" end="00:16:46.310" style="s2">if you like trust the whole institution</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.810" end="00:16:49.130" style="s2">then that has to be in the outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.310" end="00:16:50.840" style="s2">because you don&#39;t actually participate</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.130" end="00:17:02.060" style="s2">it&#39;s more has a little bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.840" end="00:17:07.579" style="s2">symbolic function there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.060" end="00:17:11.060" style="s2">noticing in here of how skewed we are to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.579" end="00:17:14.270" style="s2">trust institutions and organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.060" end="00:17:19.699" style="s2">maybe how small or a person-to-person</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.270" end="00:17:23.589" style="s2">trust network is I mean if if I if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.699" end="00:17:25.790" style="s2">reflecting on my own experience I see</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.589" end="00:17:30.350" style="s2">like if there was just a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.790" end="00:17:33.650" style="s2">institutions authorities science I trust</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.350" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">them and then people I see I see a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.650" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">lot more on the other side and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">this is interesting this is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:54.500" style="s2">interesting phenomenon also yes so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">you trust a book or an author that also</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.500" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">would be in the symbolic category um</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.190" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m noticing that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.310" end="00:18:16.950" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:21.150" style="s2">particularly people that are close to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.950" end="00:18:23.090" style="s2">that you know I go oh yeah sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.150" end="00:18:25.890" style="s2">really trust that person and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:29.670" style="s2">or trust their thinking and then other</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.890" end="00:18:36.420" style="s2">times not it depends on what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.670" end="00:18:40.049" style="s2">in the dynamic and yeah the mindset yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.420" end="00:18:44.429" style="s2">it&#39;s not static right these things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.049" end="00:18:46.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like watching the co vid statistics</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.429" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">you know the u.s. is on the bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.020" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">China is on the top and then then</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.720" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">network of course happening on the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">side of the equation also right this is</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.659" end="00:20:26.399" style="s2">a hypothetical situation and like when I</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.609" end="00:20:55.799" style="s2">like that yeah yeah yeah yeah so you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.459" end="00:21:01.099" style="s2">use prompts to get a read in your body</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.799" end="00:21:04.829" style="s2">you know and then and then like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.099" end="00:21:07.319" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just start populating but please</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.829" end="00:21:10.109" style="s2">share some your context like some people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.319" end="00:21:15.299" style="s2">notice that they trust people who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.109" end="00:21:19.649" style="s2">because they&#39;re predictable other then</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.299" end="00:21:21.959" style="s2">other people say well I get that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.649" end="00:21:25.109" style="s2">some people on my trust that iight rust</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.959" end="00:21:27.319" style="s2">cuz they&#39;re predictable but I really</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.109" end="00:21:30.859" style="s2">trust my sister and then she&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.319" end="00:21:34.979" style="s2">she&#39;s like out of control like literally</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.859" end="00:21:37.319" style="s2">she&#39;s like a loose cannon then it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.979" end="00:21:40.379" style="s2">like okay so now you have predictability</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.319" end="00:21:42.029" style="s2">that&#39;s a certain compass and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.379" end="00:21:44.279" style="s2">have this other thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.029" end="00:21:45.839" style="s2">that maybe because a family or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.279" end="00:21:51.059" style="s2">relationship where you&#39;ve been through a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.839" end="00:21:54.029" style="s2">lot or something some people especially</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.059" end="00:21:56.519" style="s2">a lot of people in organizations</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.029" end="00:22:00.059" style="s2">predictability is very big part of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.519" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">compass it&#39;s they can almost be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.059" end="00:22:09.059" style="s2">one-dimensional bull of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:11.160" style="s2">one-dimensional about that and so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.059" end="00:22:14.520" style="s2">we what we will</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.160" end="00:22:16.500" style="s2">is if that that is actually someone who</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.520" end="00:22:19.560" style="s2">has lives in a very low trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.500" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">environment if you trust based mostly on</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.560" end="00:22:23.790" style="s2">predictability you&#39;re actually living in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:25.350" style="s2">a very low trust environment it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.790" end="00:22:27.300" style="s2">when you first you know have your</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.350" end="00:22:28.950" style="s2">boyfriend I need that you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.300" end="00:22:31.110" style="s2">to call each other every five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.950" end="00:22:39.540" style="s2">right this is actually a low trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.110" end="00:22:41.460" style="s2">environment so I&#39;m beneath I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.540" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">as I think more and more about context</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.460" end="00:22:46.110" style="s2">that different people are in different</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.880" style="s2">circles depending on context right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.110" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2">so you know I&#39;ve got the same name</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.880" end="00:22:50.850" style="s2">popping up in different circles as I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:52.800" style="s2">think about them in different contexts I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.850" end="00:22:54.030" style="s2">might trust their decision-making but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.800" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily trust them to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.030" end="00:22:58.860" style="s2">particularly reliable you know I might</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:23:00.780" style="s2">trust their I might trust them to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.860" end="00:23:01.710" style="s2">capable but not necessarily great on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.780" end="00:23:03.060" style="s2">decision do you know what I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.710" end="00:23:04.620" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s so many as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.060" end="00:23:06.030" style="s2">already said there&#39;s so many dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.620" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">to this that people keep jumping in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.030" end="00:23:10.380" style="s2">out of particular circles I&#39;m finding it</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:12.540" style="s2">a little bit confusing now that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.380" end="00:23:15.050" style="s2">really started to think about it really</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.540" end="00:23:15.050" style="s2">confusing</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:25.140" style="s2">does anyone have a different experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.399" end="00:23:34.019" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that my circle and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.799" end="00:23:35.759" style="s2">different contexts actually forms a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.019" end="00:23:38.190" style="s2">of a continuum with the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.759" end="00:23:41.009" style="s2">on my inner circle it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.190" end="00:23:43.529" style="s2">flavor as people that I trust care for</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.009" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">me and it&#39;s like that deep interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.529" end="00:23:48.269" style="s2">trust versus as I expand outwards it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.609" style="s2">goes into I don&#39;t think they care about</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.269" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">me but I really trust like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.609" end="00:23:54.869" style="s2">domain-specific knowledge and so I trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:56.249" style="s2">them in the more limited capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.869" end="00:23:59.960" style="s2">the people that are in between are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.249" end="00:23:59.960" style="s2">actually in between those two feelings</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.649" end="00:24:08.429" style="s2">one one thing that comes up for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.259" end="00:24:09.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting is I have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.429" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">deep circling practice that I&#39;ve had for</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.960" end="00:24:15.509" style="s2">several years and so that what Eric was</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:18.149" style="s2">mentioning about the context is apparent</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.509" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">for me but it actually shows assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.149" end="00:24:23.639" style="s2">that I have running all the time when</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:25.639" style="s2">something shows up where I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.639" end="00:24:30.509" style="s2">there seems to be conflict or a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.639" end="00:24:33.869" style="s2">disparity my my curiosity goes to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.509" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">assumption had that show up and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.869" end="00:24:38.129" style="s2">that changes in an example of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:41.129" style="s2">that the people that I don&#39;t know that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.129" end="00:24:42.779" style="s2">trust are drivers on the road it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.129" end="00:24:44.849" style="s2">that I&#39;m driving and trusting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.779" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">people to follow this but if I see</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.849" end="00:24:51.119" style="s2">somebody doing something that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:53.879" style="s2">can&#39;t challenges the trust I can quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.119" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">reassess the situation so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.879" end="00:24:57.509" style="s2">something of what Vicki talks about with</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:00.269" style="s2">relevance realization and salience</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.509" end="00:25:01.830" style="s2">landscape that is affecting this trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.269" end="00:25:03.779" style="s2">we&#39;re at where it&#39;s running on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.830" end="00:25:05.369" style="s2">autopilot and suddenly oh wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.779" end="00:25:07.979" style="s2">I actually do need to do some manual</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.369" end="00:25:09.690" style="s2">processing to see what what&#39;s alive here</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.979" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">in the context that makes me change my</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">opinion yeah so this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:17.759" style="s2">insight that you&#39;re bringing up here</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">that we want everyone to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.759" end="00:25:26.309" style="s2">to we experience breaking trusts or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">anxiety around lack of trust a billion</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.309" end="00:25:32.820" style="s2">times more than all the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:35.899" style="s2">Trust is operating in our lives and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:40.600" style="s2">actually we need to train ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.899" end="00:25:44.139" style="s2">experience the enormous amount of trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.600" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">is is part of our lived reality every</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.139" end="00:25:54.250" style="s2">day because we are becoming hyper</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:59.740" style="s2">know if your trust based upon whether I</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.700" end="00:26:01.539" style="s2">make the right decision as though this</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.740" end="00:26:03.630" style="s2">or that and untrusting you for the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.539" end="00:26:06.970" style="s2">reason you&#39;re building psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.630" end="00:26:08.769" style="s2">individuals you&#39;re basically making each</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.970" end="00:26:11.889" style="s2">other rats in a cage of whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.769" end="00:26:16.440" style="s2">gonna get a shock or not this is how our</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.889" end="00:26:20.860" style="s2">system actually works so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.440" end="00:26:23.259" style="s2">counteract that by making salient maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.860" end="00:26:27.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what you were saying all the ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.259" end="00:26:30.789" style="s2">in which the simple ways in which trust</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.789" end="00:26:40.899" style="s2">tend to be simple ways and also you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.309" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">you trust that the power companies out</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.899" end="00:26:46.600" style="s2">there fixing the power there so much</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:58.510" style="s2">baseline and it showed that the</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">on that I just remembered something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">is kind of a part of my experience that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">it is helpful to actually have some</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:28.210" style="s2">rebuilding it in terms of it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:29.860" style="s2">I can trust a person more if if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.210" end="00:28:33.820" style="s2">failed at some point and then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.860" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">establish the trust I&#39;m like that with</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.820" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">the person where it seems just there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.460" end="00:28:43.540" style="s2">shocking thing to have that</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.540" end="00:28:49.480" style="s2">person who just seems kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.210" end="00:28:53.230" style="s2">volatile for me but able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.480" end="00:28:55.150" style="s2">reestablish the connection so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.230" end="00:28:57.280" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s relating to that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.150" end="00:28:59.530" style="s2">there&#39;s not a formation of this such a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:29:01.270" style="s2">strong expectation of a baseline because</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.530" end="00:29:03.910" style="s2">I do expect that well with that person</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.270" end="00:29:07.059" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable it&#39;s possible to trust but</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.910" end="00:29:10.360" style="s2">it&#39;s also somehow requiring more</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.059" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">patience from my side and therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.360" end="00:29:16.929" style="s2">not so fixated on expecting them to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.650" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">certain way and trusting them in in each</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.929" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">and every case yeah so this is also</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:28.260" style="s2">another good insight so in the animal</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.360" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">there&#39;s so we tend to see it as like</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.280" end="00:29:46.059" style="s2">deviant behavior but it is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:50.980" style="s2">mechanism for increasing trust not but</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.059" end="00:29:52.990" style="s2">as humans we have made we misunderstand</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.600" end="00:30:15.880" style="s2">system that we can learn how to expand</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.760" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2">our trust network and we need this skill</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.880" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2">in order to build the new new society</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.670" end="00:30:31.540" style="s2">people who understand as just as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.740" end="00:30:31.540" style="s2">said that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.670" end="00:30:39.260" style="s2">breaking trust you know having a</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.260" end="00:30:46.430" style="s2">fragility of the trust is is a way then</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.530" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">to increase that trust increase that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.430" end="00:30:51.680" style="s2">relationship to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:56.270" style="s2">relationship more to have some insight</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.680" end="00:31:02.120" style="s2">into yourself and in general we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.990" end="00:36:24.269" style="s2">and it seems to be the case for some</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.329" end="00:36:27.900" style="s2">people this is the case and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.269" end="00:36:30.900" style="s2">be something like the people you trust</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.900" end="00:36:34.470" style="s2">the most become some kind of ground they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.900" end="00:36:39.980" style="s2">withdraw they are who you are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.470" end="00:36:39.980" style="s2">some kind of complete integration</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.119" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.690" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">you know once said to my partner we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.089" end="00:36:52.579" style="s2">kind of it was a difficult time and but</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.390" end="00:36:54.140" style="s2">it was like then we&#39;re like well then</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.579" end="00:36:55.790" style="s2">why are we together or something you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.140" end="00:36:59.030" style="s2">know like bottom-line it and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.790" end="00:37:01.339" style="s2">well it&#39;s like you&#39;re my my my left arm</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.030" end="00:37:03.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t pay much attention to it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.339" end="00:37:05.780" style="s2">know but but it&#39;d be like cutting off my</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.500" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">left arm and so there is something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.780" end="00:37:10.550" style="s2">happens where you know of course there</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">is also a potentially just avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.550" end="00:37:17.900" style="s2">ignoring or pretending but there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:19.970" style="s2">something where like this person is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:25.099" style="s2">always there and they know you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.970" end="00:37:30.950" style="s2">there but it anchors the possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.099" end="00:37:35.050" style="s2">you both to take that and expand trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.950" end="00:37:39.380" style="s2">in a larger group which requires more</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.050" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">participation there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.380" end="00:37:50.569" style="s2">interesting in this because for like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.710" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">great apes they trust each other because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.569" end="00:37:54.950" style="s2">they they lose their trust connection if</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">they&#39;re not grooming each other they</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.950" end="00:38:05.060" style="s2">require touch to maintain these bonds I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:07.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s as exactly that as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.060" end="00:38:10.819" style="s2">literature does but but in general</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.960" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of behaviors that have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.819" end="00:38:25.030" style="s2">be maintained to keep a band of the Apes</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:25.030" style="s2">together so much so that for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.330" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">there&#39;s not a lot of crossover in terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.030" end="00:38:37.700" style="s2">of like you know if you take like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.910" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">cat&#39;s cats have interesting social</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.700" end="00:38:44.660" style="s2">groups but if you take a female cat that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.910" end="00:38:46.850" style="s2">you know had babies and as part of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.660" end="00:38:48.620" style="s2">family and you bring it out of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.850" end="00:38:50.600" style="s2">territory for a while when it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.620" end="00:38:54.500" style="s2">into the territory it&#39;s not recognized</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:57.320" style="s2">right so but humans have this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.500" end="00:39:01.010" style="s2">do exactly what you said which i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.320" end="00:39:06.250" style="s2">is is it&#39;s like a superpower really if</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.010" end="00:39:06.250" style="s2">you think about it it&#39;s like the ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.330" end="00:39:16.580" style="s2">to feel anchored in community despite</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.010" end="00:39:17.840" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence to that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.580" end="00:39:20.030" style="s2">sometimes you meet people that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.840" end="00:39:22.190" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen in five years you just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.030" end="00:39:24.050" style="s2">just you take off where you left up you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.190" end="00:39:25.400" style="s2">know there&#39;s something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.050" end="00:39:29.270" style="s2">sometimes you don&#39;t even really like</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">them anymore you know like wow he got</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.270" end="00:39:33.590" style="s2">married and he&#39;s doing that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:35.660" style="s2">this point at which you know if you were</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.590" end="00:39:39.130" style="s2">down and out and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.660" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">there&#39;s without a question there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.130" end="00:39:48.890" style="s2">there&#39;s community there you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:53.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know if other like elephants might</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.890" end="00:39:59.270" style="s2">do some of this some of these these but</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.060" end="00:40:04.510" style="s2">in general this is a human superpower do</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.270" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">you think that that ability to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.510" end="00:40:12.140" style="s2">diffuse or elongate trust like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">could give us an opportunity to instead</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.140" end="00:40:21.290" style="s2">of instead of diffusing trust out from</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:23.330" style="s2">our inner circle into people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.290" end="00:40:25.580" style="s2">know as well or into institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.330" end="00:40:27.890" style="s2">then losing the overall amount of trust</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.580" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">in our lives that that could give us an</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.890" end="00:40:33.880" style="s2">opportunity to do both the defusing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:36.770" style="s2">kind of double down on the people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.880" end="00:40:38.630" style="s2">that were close to or create more close</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.770" end="00:40:41.260" style="s2">relationships and this has like more</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.630" end="00:40:44.270" style="s2">overall trust</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.260" end="00:40:50.090" style="s2">yeah now you see it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.270" end="00:40:52.850" style="s2">because why this is different than other</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.090" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">models and what were this excellent</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.850" end="00:40:58.600" style="s2">conversation so the old structure was</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.950" style="s2">like you trust your family or</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.600" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">Confucianism you trust your family and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.950" end="00:41:04.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a circle inside this other circle</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s a circle inside of this other</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:09.140" style="s2">circle and when we do this exercise we</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.550" end="00:41:10.100" style="s2">see there&#39;s something more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.140" end="00:41:11.870" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.100" end="00:41:17.090" style="s2">they&#39;re not just concentric circles</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.870" end="00:41:19.430" style="s2">right they&#39;re like I&#39;m always a mime at</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.090" end="00:41:21.230" style="s2">work now I&#39;m inside this circle and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.430" end="00:41:24.140" style="s2">people I really trust are somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.230" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">background and then I&#39;m over here this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.140" end="00:41:31.270" style="s2">is a much more fluid has a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:34.760" style="s2">potential to build a very deep web of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.270" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">trust in society but it&#39;s more complex</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.760" end="00:41:39.530" style="s2">right that&#39;s why we have to like look at</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:48.430" style="s2">it and think about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.530" end="00:41:51.080" style="s2">so what&#39;s interesting is to you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.430" end="00:41:54.980" style="s2">spend some time going about your</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.080" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">ordinary life and think about oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.980" end="00:42:01.640" style="s2">under now in this context on the dot in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:03.980" style="s2">the middle and there&#39;s this trust</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.640" end="00:42:06.770" style="s2">pattern that&#39;s emerging around me and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.980" end="00:42:08.270" style="s2">about everyone else too ripples within</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.770" end="00:42:11.840" style="s2">ripples and those ripples are</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.270" end="00:42:16.390" style="s2">interacting in certain ways and then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.840" end="00:42:16.390" style="s2">know really be conscious about</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.210" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">that this is a this is a skill that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.930" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">need to practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.140" end="00:42:35.380" style="s2">the question that&#39;s coming up for me is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.600" end="00:42:37.780" style="s2">like I&#39;m seeing that based on where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.380" end="00:42:39.960" style="s2">at I think in my emotional development</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.780" end="00:42:41.560" style="s2">it changes like I am in a period where</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.960" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.560" end="00:42:46.870" style="s2">important to me is emotional safety can</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">I trust that whatever I bring to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.870" end="00:42:52.870" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to judge you judge me</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.900" end="00:42:54.490" style="s2">for and but there&#39;s been other times in</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.870" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">my life when that hasn&#39;t been the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.490" end="00:42:59.380" style="s2">and I can see that it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:01.390" style="s2">starting to change it&#39;s like I want want</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.380" end="00:43:03.790" style="s2">you to challenge me more so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.390" end="00:43:06.250" style="s2">kind of as your demotion aliy moving</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.790" end="00:43:10.540" style="s2">through developmental stages what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.250" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">prioritize changes in terms of trust</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.540" end="00:43:19.780" style="s2">yeah and the other thing is if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:22.120" style="s2">become more conscious you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.780" end="00:43:23.140" style="s2">certainly conscious that depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.120" end="00:43:25.450" style="s2">what state I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.140" end="00:43:26.950" style="s2">right and of course this is why we put</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.450" end="00:43:28.870" style="s2">the people in the middle because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.950" end="00:43:33.400" style="s2">not saying people are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.870" end="00:43:40.210" style="s2">trustworthy it&#39;s just how this ripples</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.400" end="00:43:48.250" style="s2">is is emanating from us but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.210" end="00:43:50.470" style="s2">things you can do is consciously think</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.250" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">of what your trust network feels like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.470" end="00:43:56.290" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a stable State</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.530" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">and then don&#39;t give up on it when your</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.290" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">state changes</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:08.610" style="s2">so like you know the movie A Beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.100" end="00:44:09.960" style="s2">Mind is about this mathematician who</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.610" end="00:44:11.460" style="s2">could see patterns but then he got to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">see patterns everywhere because he was</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.460" end="00:44:16.320" style="s2">kind of crazy and they wanted to put him</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.090" style="s2">on medication or something and do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.320" end="00:44:21.930" style="s2">remember how it ends you know his wife</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.090" end="00:44:24.390" style="s2">says how can you use your mind to watch</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.930" end="00:44:26.700" style="s2">your mind because your mind is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.390" end="00:44:30.410" style="s2">that changes states and becomes paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.700" end="00:44:34.980" style="s2">so what does he do he uses her mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.410" end="00:44:38.430" style="s2">right so this is the power of trust that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.980" end="00:44:40.530" style="s2">when you&#39;re moving in and out</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.430" end="00:44:42.450" style="s2">there&#39;s and you know you don&#39;t need it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.530" end="00:44:44.370" style="s2">not about quantity but if you and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.450" end="00:44:49.770" style="s2">sure this is what you do but when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.370" end="00:44:52.320" style="s2">have this this conceptual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.770" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">in your stable state of what is trust</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.320" end="00:45:00.470" style="s2">your trust network then you can know</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">that you feel disoriented</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.470" end="00:45:06.860" style="s2">but keep some kind of intact environment</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:09.050" style="s2">keep yourself in place inside that trust</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.860" end="00:45:11.000" style="s2">Network you know it&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.050" end="00:45:12.620" style="s2">visualization you know we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.000" end="00:45:17.470" style="s2">rely on the conceptual map we made</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.620" end="00:45:17.470" style="s2">before we kind of got that disoriented</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.950" end="00:45:21.010" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.730" end="00:45:32.260" style="s2">okay say more about this Shawn this is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.579" end="00:45:35.290" style="s2">this is an interesting one final</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.260" end="00:45:36.700" style="s2">question on that when you say that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.290" end="00:45:40.089" style="s2">mean you&#39;re sort of observing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.700" end="00:45:41.980" style="s2">as a pattern and you try to build a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.089" end="00:45:44.310" style="s2">somatic sense for what does your trust</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.980" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">network feel like I feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.310" end="00:45:49.780" style="s2">destabilization might have its own</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:52.780" style="s2">purpose so if you are moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.780" end="00:45:54.849" style="s2">being stable to unstable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.780" end="00:45:56.770" style="s2">potentially due to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.849" end="00:45:57.849" style="s2">interaction with someone in your trust</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.770" end="00:46:00.700" style="s2">network so there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.849" end="00:46:02.260" style="s2">reorientation of the entire map so</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.700" end="00:46:04.390" style="s2">trying to hold on to that previous</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.260" end="00:46:09.160" style="s2">somatic sense of the network might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.390" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">misleading it would it not yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.160" end="00:46:14.619" style="s2">is the other side of the coin you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:16.900" style="s2">the movie the plan of the humans just</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.619" end="00:46:21.099" style="s2">shows how so much of the green new deal</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.900" end="00:46:22.540" style="s2">is is just an illusion you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.099" end="00:46:24.910" style="s2">you have this environmentalist doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.540" end="00:46:27.430" style="s2">some research and it&#39;s like he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.910" end="00:46:29.230" style="s2">trust anyone you know like it just goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.430" end="00:46:31.329" style="s2">boom boom I mean I was a pretty much a</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.230" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">skeptic anyways just this thing blew my</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.329" end="00:46:42.329" style="s2">mind how deep the irony let&#39;s say goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:46.540" style="s2">so we don&#39;t want to be naive we want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.329" end="00:46:48.550" style="s2">build a certain capacity because there</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.540" end="00:46:54.010" style="s2">might be a worm in your trust Network</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.550" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">right and so this is a funny thing I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.010" end="00:47:02.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know if any of you have been in</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">this experience but you might be like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.470" end="00:47:08.980" style="s2">was in an organization did a start-up</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:13.869" style="s2">turned into a large landscape firm but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.980" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">was it was the owner had a small company</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.869" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">and anyways it was one of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:21.210" style="s2">companies where it was started with this</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.530" style="s2">woman she was the bookkeeper forever and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.210" end="00:47:26.589" style="s2">you know she had all the power because</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.530" end="00:47:28.300" style="s2">she just when you&#39;re a small company the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.589" end="00:47:30.040" style="s2">owners don&#39;t know really they don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.300" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">at the books and this and that and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.040" end="00:47:34.670" style="s2">knew that she was crooked but she was</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:36.860" style="s2">such a nice person and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.670" end="00:47:40.070" style="s2">she was always bringing in lunches and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.860" end="00:47:41.450" style="s2">all this stuff you know like like so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.070" end="00:47:43.250" style="s2">people think you&#39;re crazy</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.450" end="00:47:46.280" style="s2">they literally think you&#39;re crazy</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.250" end="00:47:49.550" style="s2">because you have this intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.280" end="00:47:51.230" style="s2">this person is not trustworthy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.550" end="00:47:53.180" style="s2">this has happened many times in my life</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.230" end="00:47:55.610" style="s2">too so I mean she ended up killing her</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.180" end="00:47:57.950" style="s2">husband when you know when we started to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.610" end="00:48:03.350" style="s2">realize she was extorting money but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.950" end="00:48:06.410" style="s2">like the when when the trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.350" end="00:48:10.820" style="s2">system is built on illusion this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.410" end="00:48:12.650" style="s2">kind of a crazy the collective can</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.820" end="00:48:15.530" style="s2">become you know you can drive you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.650" end="00:48:18.200" style="s2">and Noor Jinnah lies people have this</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.530" end="00:48:24.020" style="s2">problem they can see that people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.200" end="00:48:25.550" style="s2">lying and they appear to be crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.020" end="00:48:29.620" style="s2">they actually start getting crazy</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.550" end="00:48:29.620" style="s2">because what&#39;s self-evident to them</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.540" end="00:48:36.370" style="s2">yeah people trust trust people where are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.840" end="00:48:41.020" style="s2">other people can see it&#39;s self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.370" end="00:48:45.000" style="s2">that this is just a predator really you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.020" end="00:48:45.000" style="s2">know so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.049" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">was that something you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.430" end="00:49:02.380" style="s2">about yeah a moment that specifically</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:04.299" style="s2">how kind of stigmatization of anger and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.380" end="00:49:06.269" style="s2">similar expressions could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.299" end="00:49:10.150" style="s2">contributing to that because I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.269" end="00:49:12.549" style="s2">very often people even resort to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.150" end="00:49:14.289" style="s2">angering others in order to gain more</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.549" end="00:49:17.529" style="s2">honesty because it&#39;s kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.289" end="00:49:19.690" style="s2">difficult to fake stuff while being</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.529" end="00:49:21.640" style="s2">angry so it&#39;s kind of a litmus test if</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.690" end="00:49:24.549" style="s2">you can say things in a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.640" end="00:49:26.769" style="s2">angry way it&#39;s it&#39;s more reliable and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.549" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">when anger and aggression are</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.769" end="00:49:32.380" style="s2">stigmatized not that they are it should</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:37.480" style="s2">be accepted but it&#39;s like it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.380" end="00:49:42.940" style="s2">a no-go zone altogether then this also</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.480" end="00:49:48.519" style="s2">becomes like kind of a less actionable</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.940" end="00:49:50.499" style="s2">way of checking because if you&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.519" end="00:49:53.380" style="s2">with with your honesty it&#39;s also somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.499" end="00:49:54.759" style="s2">already bad that you are angry that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.380" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">you&#39;re expressing it in somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.759" end="00:49:58.930" style="s2">aggressive way and I think there should</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:50:02.049" style="s2">be space for that but if everything is</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.930" end="00:50:05.049" style="s2">so PC in our cultures that it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.049" end="00:50:08.200" style="s2">longer possible to just be angry or kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.049" end="00:50:12.579" style="s2">of dismissed then and then what would</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.200" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">actually help as a kind of a sign of you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.579" end="00:50:21.700" style="s2">sharing honestly something that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:24.519" style="s2">really important to you is lost exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.700" end="00:50:27.009" style="s2">and and the more they relate the more</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.519" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">trust in the relationship the more</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.009" end="00:50:32.589" style="s2">energy it can tolerate without without</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:35.289" style="s2">breaking and so then you start to build</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.589" end="00:50:37.869" style="s2">like these fantastic capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.289" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">small teams I haven&#39;t seen it in large</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.869" end="00:50:48.130" style="s2">teams but you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.440" style="s2">that erodes trust is is pretending you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.130" end="00:50:52.660" style="s2">know this like this surface way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.440" end="00:50:55.509" style="s2">relating and a lot of people think</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.660" end="00:50:59.259" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it so that to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.509" end="00:51:01.809" style="s2">trust you know oh my god then you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.259" end="00:51:04.599" style="s2">but this actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.809" end="00:51:07.269" style="s2">we have a you know signals to the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.599" end="00:51:09.099" style="s2">collective that the trust is is is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.269" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">really very fragile and weak or</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.099" end="00:51:15.449" style="s2">non-existent and many people work at</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:23.400" style="s2">this level you know all day every day</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.449" end="00:51:26.289" style="s2">this level of fake trust its semantics</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.400" end="00:51:29.559" style="s2">there&#39;s implicit social rules of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.289" end="00:51:31.509" style="s2">you say don&#39;t say nobody talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.559" end="00:51:34.749" style="s2">but some things are sanctioned and some</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.509" end="00:51:38.709" style="s2">are not you know and all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.749" end="00:51:41.199" style="s2">underlying games are not our very low</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.709" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">trust environments you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.199" end="00:51:46.900" style="s2">coming to mind is I&#39;m doing check-ins at</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:49.390" style="s2">each time I start these sessions in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.900" end="00:51:50.890" style="s2">emotional state and when people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.390" end="00:51:52.930" style="s2">asking me how am i doing right now I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.890" end="00:51:55.930" style="s2">just want to tell them how I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.930" end="00:51:58.269" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say good because this like</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.930" end="00:52:04.059" style="s2">that is like the prison right there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.269" end="00:52:07.929" style="s2">just saying good yeah yeah someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.059" end="00:52:10.420" style="s2">just reflecting back about how there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.929" end="00:52:12.579" style="s2">this is this is something that&#39;s in in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.420" end="00:52:15.819" style="s2">our society you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.579" end="00:52:18.519" style="s2">there&#39;s some the erosion of trust in our</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.819" end="00:52:21.980" style="s2">society and the relationship to mental</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.519" end="00:52:25.050" style="s2">health is a big deal</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.419" end="00:54:41.219" style="s2">that relationships are being strategized</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.579" end="00:54:43.749" style="s2">is gives you is a low trust environment</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.219" end="00:54:45.939" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that anyone&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.749" end="00:54:48.219" style="s2">anything wrong I&#39;m just saying if you if</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.939" end="00:54:54.429" style="s2">you can be members of groups which are</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.219" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">important but to notice that you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.429" end="00:54:59.979" style="s2">certainly not capable of doing very</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.160" end="00:55:03.539" style="s2">complex tasks together because the trust</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.979" end="00:55:03.539" style="s2">environment is very low</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.480" end="00:55:11.160" style="s2">would you say a bit about this in</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.030" end="00:55:14.040" style="s2">relation to what Zacks time says about</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.160" end="00:55:16.890" style="s2">like teacherly Authority like if someone</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.040" end="00:55:20.730" style="s2">says hey in my developmental process</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.890" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">I have gaps in myself trust can who can</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.730" end="00:55:25.620" style="s2">teach me how to trust myself but then</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:27.660" style="s2">they don&#39;t they are admitted they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.620" end="00:55:29.520" style="s2">saying that like I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.660" end="00:55:33.050" style="s2">find a teacher that I trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.520" end="00:55:33.050" style="s2">gets very complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.760" end="00:55:45.210" style="s2">yeah so trust teaching trust or</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:46.910" style="s2">mentoring trust is interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.210" end="00:55:50.010" style="s2">different than this what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.910" end="00:55:51.829" style="s2">because to tree teach or mentor trust</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.010" end="00:55:54.829" style="s2">you just have to trust</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.829" end="00:55:54.829" style="s2">full-stop</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.730" end="00:56:01.020" style="s2">and you&#39;re not even naive you know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.100" end="00:56:04.320" style="s2">you&#39;re you know you lend money you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.020" end="00:56:06.600" style="s2">not getting it back and but to mentor</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.320" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">and teach trust you just have to trust</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.600" end="00:56:10.840" style="s2">full-stop</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:10.840" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.670" end="00:56:18.550" style="s2">we&#39;re capable of that yes so the only</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.450" end="00:56:20.950" style="s2">person that I&#39;ve actually had this</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.550" end="00:56:27.000" style="s2">amazing experience with is do you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.950" end="00:56:30.870" style="s2">soryu he runs the maple but he says</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.000" end="00:56:34.950" style="s2">my job is to love you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.870" end="00:56:36.900" style="s2">that&#39;s it and that course that II didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.950" end="00:56:39.480" style="s2">use the word trust but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.900" end="00:56:43.950" style="s2">just a simple phrase but when this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.480" end="00:56:46.380" style="s2">this really lands so this is not someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.950" end="00:56:49.050" style="s2">who has the same kind of trust network</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.380" end="00:56:54.420" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about right this is just</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.050" end="00:57:03.030" style="s2">something beyond that so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.420" end="00:57:05.700" style="s2">a lot of fragility in the work we do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.030" end="00:57:06.600" style="s2">concluding myself in Zack we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.700" end="00:57:11.910" style="s2">there yet</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.600" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s very I was on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.910" end="00:57:17.910" style="s2">workgroup with him and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:21.900" style="s2">about my question was can the modern</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.910" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">mind I mean our minds actually separate</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.900" end="00:57:27.989" style="s2">interiors from exteriors</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:31.140" style="s2">can we actually separate the spin-around</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.989" end="00:57:33.529" style="s2">kovat from what is actually real and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.140" end="00:57:36.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can so these are</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.529" end="00:57:40.009" style="s2">psychotic psychotic tendencies in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.450" end="00:57:44.519" style="s2">modern collective that that makes trust</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.009" end="00:57:46.680" style="s2">not not that stable when we were just</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.519" end="00:57:48.979" style="s2">being honest so it this is just trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.680" end="00:57:53.789" style="s2">to be honest about this</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.979" end="00:57:55.950" style="s2">so so part of what he&#39;s writing about is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.789" end="00:57:59.549" style="s2">also coming from that place you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.950" end="00:58:01.589" style="s2">he&#39;s reflecting that back on so so if</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.549" end="00:58:05.069" style="s2">you have for example teacherly authority</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.589" end="00:58:10.410" style="s2">I have to be able to make a case that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.069" end="00:58:13.259" style="s2">this is real and that&#39;s not real I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.410" end="00:58:17.099" style="s2">to make a case for whether vaccines are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.259" end="00:58:19.170" style="s2">good or not or any of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.099" end="00:58:22.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible to make that case</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.170" end="00:58:30.029" style="s2">right now so then you could say bruno</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.380" end="00:58:33.960" style="s2">latour said that truth is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.029" end="00:58:38.609" style="s2">anchored in trust not like scientific</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.960" end="00:58:41.160" style="s2">validity so that you will trust the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.609" end="00:58:43.289" style="s2">infra will think you will believe what</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.160" end="00:58:45.809" style="s2">is true based upon the trust networks</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.289" end="00:58:49.819" style="s2">you have built which brings us back to</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.809" end="00:58:53.219" style="s2">the exercise that you in and of course</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.819" end="00:58:55.049" style="s2">many of you did notice that you believed</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.219" end="00:58:57.420" style="s2">the laws of nature you believe you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.049" end="00:58:59.670" style="s2">there&#39;s this independent objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.420" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">that you trust but this is starting</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.670" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">these lines are starting to blur</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.500" end="00:59:11.630" style="s2">and it seems that and Latour talks about</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.360" end="00:59:14.270" style="s2">the the root word for truth is trough</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.630" end="00:59:20.870" style="s2">which means trust so they&#39;re very close</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.270" end="00:59:24.950" style="s2">they&#39;re very very close we trust the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.870" end="00:59:29.990" style="s2">laws of nature because they apply to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.950" end="00:59:32.420" style="s2">predictable things but now we&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.990" end="00:59:34.670" style="s2">questions about nature to have no</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.420" end="00:59:36.920" style="s2">predictable answers what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.670" end="00:59:44.260" style="s2">relationship between trust and truth in</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.920" end="00:59:47.030" style="s2">those situations so this is all part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.260" end="00:59:49.550" style="s2">so this was just trying to get at you</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.030" end="00:59:51.290" style="s2">know the source code of trust as we</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.550" end="00:59:54.680" style="s2">discovered last time it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.290" end="00:59:57.650" style="s2">conceptual activity somehow we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.680" end="00:59:59.930" style="s2">our body as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.650" end="01:00:04.280" style="s2">the abstractor of the essential elements</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.930" end="01:00:07.480" style="s2">of the essential core meaning right</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.280" end="01:00:13.850" style="s2">it is conceptual obviously but unlike</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.480" end="01:00:17.150" style="s2">conceptual reductionism or we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.850" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">doing what I call source code work which</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.150" end="01:00:27.710" style="s2">is always the the body is part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">getting to the protocol benita yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.710" end="01:00:31.910" style="s2">being cognizant at the time and I sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:34.310" style="s2">I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.910" end="01:00:36.710" style="s2">a couple things that were happening in</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.310" end="01:00:39.980" style="s2">the a chat been messaging people</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.050" end="01:00:59.150" style="s2">the trust just built and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:01:00.710" style="s2">Ryan here he has something on that good</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.260" end="01:01:12.860" style="s2">activities where we just like you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.420" end="01:01:17.300" style="s2">find our way to each other&#39;s hearts</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.860" end="01:01:18.830" style="s2">without you know getting too abstract so</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.300" end="01:01:20.810" style="s2">yeah those are those insights that came</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.830" end="01:01:25.160" style="s2">forth for me for this session so I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.810" end="01:01:26.390" style="s2">that was pretty pretty awesome so I hand</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.380" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">what you know we do very similar things</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.020" end="01:01:40.910" style="s2">with the horse workshops is people here</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:43.640" style="s2">on the call can attest to</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.910" end="01:01:45.980" style="s2">I mean basically there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.640" end="01:01:47.960" style="s2">horses and being in nature that opens</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.980" end="01:01:51.700" style="s2">your heart and then people cry and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.960" end="01:01:55.250" style="s2">there&#39;s this really beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.700" end="01:01:57.230" style="s2">consequence of building the human system</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.250" end="01:02:00.650" style="s2">but also extending that to the natural</p>
