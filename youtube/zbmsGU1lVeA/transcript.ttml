<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">quite a while it seems like last summer</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">last time I talked to David</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.270" end="00:01:24.070" style="s2">however one of the things I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.250" end="00:01:26.619" style="s2">appreciated in the conversation was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.070" end="00:01:32.140" style="s2">lot of things kind of coming together I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.619" end="00:01:39.130" style="s2">think for David and for myself a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.140" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">understanding about what rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.130" end="00:01:48.520" style="s2">and David in particular is really doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:50.140" style="s2">I&#39;m on multiple levels and with his</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.520" end="00:01:52.890" style="s2">channel and his work and the choices</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.140" end="00:01:55.929" style="s2">that they&#39;ve made there and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:57.069" style="s2">David comes from in particular this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.929" end="00:02:00.520" style="s2">the thing I really appreciate it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.069" end="00:02:05.289" style="s2">that David comes from a more of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.520" end="00:02:10.119" style="s2">traditional media background an NBC in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.289" end="00:02:13.299" style="s2">BBC and he&#39;s an example kind of a rare</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.119" end="00:02:16.900" style="s2">example of someone who was deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.299" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">that world very ethnically and has</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">transitioned into out of the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:29.950" style="s2">social media into whatever this is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:33.639" style="s2">were watching right now still yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:36.430" style="s2">defined however him bringing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.639" end="00:02:41.079" style="s2">those sensibilities to bear in a real</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.430" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">positive way and being a witness to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.079" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">chicken to the change in media as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">whole but from inside of it so we got</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:57.220" style="s2">into we got into a lot of that and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:59.079" style="s2">that was like for him and examples were</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.220" end="00:03:01.180" style="s2">that is happening in other places and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.079" end="00:03:02.889" style="s2">people that isn&#39;t happening and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.180" end="00:03:07.150" style="s2">really enlightening conversation so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.889" end="00:03:10.569" style="s2">really enjoyed it a lot and um we we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.150" end="00:03:12.459" style="s2">talked about a video where he he had</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.569" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">watched recently that I think he had he</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.459" end="00:03:16.900" style="s2">had done right when they started the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:20.099" style="s2">channel so I&#39;ll include a link for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">below so you can watch that where he</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.099" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">listened to what he thought the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:29.620" style="s2">was about that channel and what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:31.150" style="s2">were up to and whatever a year over a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.620" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">year later he watches it again and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.150" end="00:03:34.350" style="s2">realizes that his</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:38.610" style="s2">he&#39;s right in the middle of what he</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.350" end="00:03:41.870" style="s2">thought was coming so it has that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.610" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">conversation has that glimmer of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.870" end="00:03:47.900" style="s2">emergent intelligibility kind of crackle</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">a few times so it was really great so uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.900" end="00:03:53.780" style="s2">hope to do it again with him soon</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:53.780" style="s2">enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.450" end="00:04:06.390" style="s2">hello David hey guy we just hit the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">record button yeah so we were just</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.390" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">talking about your everything is has</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">slowed down or locked down around you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:18.510" style="s2">but rebel wisdom is is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:19.430" style="s2">cooking you&#39;re busier than you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.510" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.430" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">yeah yeah I sort of see people on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">Facebook talking about how they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">of bored and they&#39;ve watched everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">on Netflix and they&#39;re not sure what to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:32.790" style="s2">do next and what happens when life gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:36.450" style="s2">back to normal and friend of mine posted</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.790" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">something like what habits from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.450" end="00:04:40.200" style="s2">lockdown are you gonna carry on when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:41.700" style="s2">get back to normal and bleep saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.200" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">gonna make more space in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:47.460" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s not my reality and hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:49.050" style="s2">been since I guess kind of it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.460" end="00:04:53.220" style="s2">for my friend back in journalism as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.050" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">right there when the news ramps up</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.220" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">they&#39;re very very busy but that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">found since the beginning of this is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2">enough hours in the day to do all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">things that need to be done and just an</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.640" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">expansion on every level of become the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:18.780" style="s2">business effectively the rebel wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">there&#39;s the film&#39;s we&#39;ve done of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.780" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">couple of big online events in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.590" end="00:05:26.910" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of focused us a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:28.470" style="s2">clearly because we were doing some</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.910" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">in-person events and some online events</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.470" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">but it&#39;s been very clear it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:38.010" style="s2">you know you&#39;re in which side of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.150" end="00:05:39.080" style="s2">which side of the fence are you on on</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.010" end="00:05:45.419" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.080" end="00:05:49.230" style="s2">like it or not it&#39;s I mean the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.419" end="00:05:52.200" style="s2">person the in-person events certainly</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.230" end="00:05:53.669" style="s2">the festival last year in the festival</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.200" end="00:05:55.800" style="s2">this year was going to be a sort of high</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.669" end="00:05:59.570" style="s2">point so the fact that we&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.800" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">bring that online yeah feels a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.570" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a disappointment that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:04.950" style="s2">are lots of people who are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:07.030" style="s2">flying in from around the world who</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.950" end="00:06:10.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve been connecting with on</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.030" end="00:06:13.270" style="s2">for many months and that was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.510" end="00:06:16.930" style="s2">a big event potentially up to like 300</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.270" end="00:06:17.950" style="s2">400 people in London right so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.930" end="00:06:21.100" style="s2">that that&#39;s not happening is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.950" end="00:06:25.750" style="s2">disappointing right but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.100" end="00:06:29.350" style="s2">I actually feel the focus that comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.750" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">from knowing that all of the energy is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.350" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">now going into online building online</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">community is actually quite good mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:41.710" style="s2">yes there was all this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">difficulty of trying to be but Oh could</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.710" end="00:06:45.430" style="s2">we run retreat so we really value like</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:47.590" style="s2">we know that there&#39;s something you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.430" end="00:06:49.060" style="s2">do in person you can&#39;t do online yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.590" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">we&#39;d always been sort of split between</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.060" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">well do we do more in-person retrieves</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:55.000" style="s2">what do we do more online community in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.500" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.000" end="00:06:59.320" style="s2">option taken away it makes things a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">clearer I think yeah totally I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.320" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of going through something as</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.270" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.810" end="00:07:07.150" style="s2">like I I put up doing all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.270" end="00:07:09.630" style="s2">online all of my courses and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.150" end="00:07:12.340" style="s2">that online for as long as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.630" end="00:07:14.110" style="s2">then of course this happened and it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.340" end="00:07:21.610" style="s2">forced us into it now we&#39;re realizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.110" end="00:07:23.170" style="s2">like it&#39;s very difficult to not it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.610" end="00:07:26.200" style="s2">that I mean that&#39;s interesting in itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.170" end="00:07:30.460" style="s2">just the fact of how easy it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.200" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">online right and like how practical it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.460" end="00:07:36.910" style="s2">is on so many different levels yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:39.430" style="s2">it works actually it&#39;s funny I was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.910" end="00:07:40.930" style="s2">surprised with working with groups and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.430" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">stuff like that that it actually works</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.930" end="00:07:47.820" style="s2">pretty pretty well like surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:50.920" style="s2">well so it works but I&#39;m with you about</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.820" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing like you know a roomful</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.920" end="00:07:54.280" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:57.190" style="s2">like getting into it like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.280" end="00:07:59.620" style="s2">nothing like the the oxytocin and all</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.190" end="00:08:03.010" style="s2">the serotonin and all the dopamine that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.620" end="00:08:07.090" style="s2">gets going in that space that&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.010" end="00:08:09.250" style="s2">nothing like that for sure you know it</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.090" end="00:08:10.330" style="s2">the last time last time we talked I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.250" end="00:08:15.340" style="s2">think you had just gotten back from</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.330" end="00:08:16.480" style="s2">Burning Man mmm and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.340" end="00:08:17.730" style="s2">things that struck me about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.480" end="00:08:19.570" style="s2">conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.730" end="00:08:22.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.570" end="00:08:25.720" style="s2">was how much you were kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.480" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">process of kind of finding what you were</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.720" end="00:08:30.310" style="s2">doing is you were doing it yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:31.900" style="s2">you were it&#39;s almost like I got the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.310" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">sense of what you&#39;re up to with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.900" end="00:08:39.850" style="s2">rebel wisdom that you were in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:43.300" style="s2">authoring it hmm however you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.850" end="00:08:45.010" style="s2">clear exactly your role in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.300" end="00:08:46.930" style="s2">authorship right that it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">literally a conversation that you were</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.930" end="00:08:52.510" style="s2">having and it sounds like it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:54.400" style="s2">when I&#39;ve when I&#39;ve heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.510" end="00:08:57.220" style="s2">lately it&#39;s it sounds like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.400" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">it&#39;s turned a little bit more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.220" end="00:09:03.280" style="s2">more clear about the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:04.990" style="s2">you&#39;re going and it&#39;s not at least what</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.280" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing words to you know update me</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:11.850" style="s2">with this but it sounds like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">really turned a corner in terms of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.850" end="00:09:17.980" style="s2">taking on practice and providing a space</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">for the practice of the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">technologies and all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:22.750" style="s2">have been talking about is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:26.380" style="s2">true how do you see how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.750" end="00:09:31.570" style="s2">yourself now when rebel wisdom yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.380" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">guess the we did a big free one-day</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.570" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">event the on the faith and that was was</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.400" style="s2">called resilience and sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:44.440" style="s2">it had kind of a framing at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.400" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">beginning with Jamie wheel and Dan Marsh</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.440" end="00:09:49.570" style="s2">Oh Hamilton talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:52.270" style="s2">bigger picture and then we after that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">did lots of breakouts with practices of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.270" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">about I think each and we have three</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:09:59.740" style="s2">breakout running at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:02.710" style="s2">they&#39;re up to about 100 people that need</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.740" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">to break out each time sub breakouts</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.710" end="00:10:10.110" style="s2">within those doing different practices</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:13.780" style="s2">mm-hmm inquiry to breath work to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.110" end="00:10:18.130" style="s2">movement and that felt very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.780" end="00:10:20.770" style="s2">probably the the first time that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.130" end="00:10:22.930" style="s2">done an event that really felt like he</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.770" end="00:10:25.330" style="s2">jailed quite as well like we had the we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.930" end="00:10:27.070" style="s2">had the sense making we had the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.330" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">big picture intellectual content but</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.070" end="00:10:32.260" style="s2">then we also drew a very clear line to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">well if you want to make sense well you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.260" end="00:10:35.880" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:37.410" style="s2">the work yeah want to be resilient part</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.880" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">of being resilient is understanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.410" end="00:10:41.940" style="s2">what&#39;s going on maybe understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:44.100" style="s2">the deeper shifts are that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.940" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">like if this is the end of the old</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.100" end="00:10:50.610" style="s2">system and it&#39;s gonna feel like a death</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">in a lot of ways understanding what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.610" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">might mean kind of systematically and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:58.170" style="s2">intellectually is going to help us feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:11:01.170" style="s2">a bit more grounded and resilient but</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.170" end="00:11:04.410" style="s2">then there&#39;s also the work of yeah Wow</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.170" end="00:11:07.740" style="s2">how do i how do I feel about this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.410" end="00:11:10.380" style="s2">how do I give voice to that and to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.740" end="00:11:13.320" style="s2">through the processes like this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.380" end="00:11:16.080" style="s2">senses and the other thing as well since</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.320" end="00:11:21.450" style="s2">the beginning of this crisis I looked</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.080" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">back at the film that we made two years</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.450" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">ago to sort of say what is rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:29.010" style="s2">and it all fits with what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:30.750" style="s2">right now like I watched it I made that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.010" end="00:11:33.420" style="s2">film and yet when I watched it again I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.750" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">watched it almost with new eyes like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.420" end="00:11:36.390" style="s2">says at the beginning this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:38.010" style="s2">descent we&#39;re going through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.390" end="00:11:39.690" style="s2">breakdown of the old system and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.010" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">everything that we&#39;ve been doing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.690" end="00:11:46.590" style="s2">rebel wisdom since the beginning has</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">been like suddenly I am recopy that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.590" end="00:11:53.970" style="s2">written which before probably only a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:55.470" style="s2">people in this kind of there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.970" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">really a good name for the met aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.470" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">the sense making way of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">kind of people that I know you are in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">dialog with as well you&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:08.730" style="s2">wow we&#39;re in a meaning crisis we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:10.980" style="s2">some kind of a real systemic crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.730" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">that&#39;s going to unfold now I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:17.160" style="s2">that&#39;s becoming really clear to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:19.880" style="s2">yeah yeah totally so I think maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.160" end="00:12:22.470" style="s2">feel the same but just this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.880" end="00:12:26.130" style="s2">since the beginning of this crisis just</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.470" end="00:12:31.170" style="s2">this deep sense of alignment and focus</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.130" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">and purpose has been just like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.170" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">absolutely kind of solid core of this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.620" end="00:12:43.230" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;ve been preparing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">and tracking on some level since since</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.230" end="00:12:46.860" style="s2">the beginning of rebel wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:49.560" style="s2">probably since kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:52.350" style="s2">background before I came into before I</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.560" end="00:12:56.040" style="s2">created rebel wisdom like this was this</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.350" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">was and we&#39;re now in a in a time where</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.040" end="00:13:01.460" style="s2">the news what the updates of the news</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:04.680" style="s2">needs that deeper level like</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.460" end="00:13:06.780" style="s2">understanding systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.680" end="00:13:08.760" style="s2">understanding complexity understanding</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.780" end="00:13:10.590" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually make sense of even</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.760" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">the day-to-day right now without some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.590" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">those deeper lenses yeah and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:17.610" style="s2">you even need to go back to like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:21.390" style="s2">mythopoetic lens of what is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.610" end="00:13:23.160" style="s2">this as Jordan wall I know you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.390" end="00:13:26.310" style="s2">in dialog with quite a bit talks about</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.160" end="00:13:29.940" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.310" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">is so important but so rarely used and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.940" end="00:13:34.590" style="s2">we store it in the mythopoetic layer</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:35.880" style="s2">yeah yeah they&#39;re in deepest stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.590" end="00:13:38.190" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of thing that we may only</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.880" end="00:13:40.230" style="s2">need once every couple of generations or</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.190" end="00:13:41.790" style="s2">once every millennium that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.230" end="00:13:43.170" style="s2">store it that&#39;s why those store that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.790" end="00:13:45.090" style="s2">what we have those stories and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.170" end="00:13:46.920" style="s2">why they resonates so deeply is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.090" end="00:13:49.980" style="s2">this is going to come in useful sometime</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.920" end="00:13:51.270" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s the sense of those of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.980" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">whose been who&#39;ve been looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.270" end="00:13:58.230" style="s2">world through that kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">mythopoetic layer this is when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.230" end="00:14:02.070" style="s2">rubber meets the road and so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve been talking to and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.070" end="00:14:07.650" style="s2">even in the the rebel wisdom community</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:10.380" style="s2">are group calls they&#39;ve just been the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.650" end="00:14:14.070" style="s2">sense of like focus and per person like</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.380" end="00:14:16.770" style="s2">so many people saying yes this is these</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.070" end="00:14:18.150" style="s2">are the times I was built for this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.770" end="00:14:21.510" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been preparing for without</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.150" end="00:14:25.230" style="s2">realizing it for the last however many</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.510" end="00:14:26.460" style="s2">years so there&#39;s the sense and then when</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.230" end="00:14:28.200" style="s2">I look back at some of the material that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.460" end="00:14:30.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve put out on rebel wisdom I look I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.200" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">think wow just look so prescient right</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.990" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">now yeah all of these people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:39.840" style="s2">been interviewing and like these these</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">incredible thinkers packing what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.840" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">been saying it&#39;s like yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:48.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that many of us have</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.340" style="s2">been sensing this and in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.600" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">feeling like okay this this was going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.340" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">happen yeah yeah yeah literally you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:58.380" style="s2">been sensing it and responding to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:00.780" style="s2">right and so it sounds like you had a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.380" end="00:15:04.050" style="s2">kissed so when you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.780" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">is that is that the glitch in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.050" end="00:15:08.970" style="s2">which which film is that that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.650" style="s2">talking about that you watched of oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.970" end="00:15:17.070" style="s2">talking about actually the two and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.650" end="00:15:19.650" style="s2">half minute film that was it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.070" end="00:15:22.170" style="s2">what is rebel wisdom there is literally</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.650" end="00:15:23.340" style="s2">just there okay very short clips and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.170" end="00:15:25.410" style="s2">we can maybe put it in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.340" end="00:15:27.840" style="s2">for anyone watching who wants to see it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.410" end="00:15:30.150" style="s2">I&#39;d be really really interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.840" end="00:15:32.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s gonna be thing what you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.150" end="00:15:34.770" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing because it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.670" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">could look at the way that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.770" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">talking about what you&#39;ve been doing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:42.540" style="s2">your future and then come back and look</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:47.850" style="s2">at it and then compare notes and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.540" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">even that is a that&#39;s a trip yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.850" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">that itself is like a way of making like</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:53.970" style="s2">a way of making sense and honing</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:55.590" style="s2">yourself up it&#39;s like a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:15:57.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really quick and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.590" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">feedback that you&#39;re getting from your</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.000" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">pro cuz now that you have participants</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:03.090" style="s2">right you don&#39;t just have audiences but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.280" style="s2">you have participants right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.090" end="00:16:07.339" style="s2">getting up back and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.280" end="00:16:13.070" style="s2">interesting you&#39;re in a really unusual</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.339" end="00:16:15.150" style="s2">it seems to me a really unusual position</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.070" end="00:16:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s all for me to say whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.150" end="00:16:26.490" style="s2">unusual it&#39;s quite usual for me now that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:27.930" style="s2">the this sense of I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:32.610" style="s2">as we were gonna have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.930" end="00:16:35.339" style="s2">I was thinking about you know your</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.610" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">history is within mainstream media right</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.339" end="00:16:41.310" style="s2">like he worked with NBC and BB slap yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:51.240" style="s2">mostly Channel 4 News</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.310" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">I was in the Channel 4 News room so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.240" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">in in in those institutions right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.890" end="00:16:58.650" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:03.480" style="s2">watching I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been putting on</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.650" end="00:17:06.810" style="s2">like the NBC Nightly News mm-hm and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.480" end="00:17:09.150" style="s2">know the the music comes on and breaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.810" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">news today and you know all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.150" end="00:17:13.399" style="s2">it hits all those anchors from when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:18.149" style="s2">was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.399" end="00:17:19.770" style="s2">this this experience of of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.149" end="00:17:22.140" style="s2">everything would stop when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:24.689" style="s2">when when dan Rather would come on right</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.140" end="00:17:27.390" style="s2">and like in everyone good would go right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.689" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">there would be something like there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.390" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">no questions about what we were watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:37.649" style="s2">and it was so almost ritualistic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:39.659" style="s2">and I noticed that liked it although it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.649" end="00:17:40.169" style="s2">hit all those it hits all those anchors</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.659" end="00:17:42.570" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.169" end="00:17:46.610" style="s2">I remember those but when I look at that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.570" end="00:17:49.590" style="s2">thing I&#39;m like it&#39;s so clear that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.610" end="00:17:51.450" style="s2">something else is happening than what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.590" end="00:17:53.730" style="s2">thought was happening back then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.450" end="00:17:58.520" style="s2">just like those main the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.730" end="00:18:01.830" style="s2">media is breaking down at such a level</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.520" end="00:18:03.179" style="s2">and changing so deeply it&#39;s just you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.830" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">the sense that they don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.179" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">they are however it&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">institutions that have grounded us right</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:14.669" style="s2">in so many ways and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:17.549" style="s2">interesting to think about like when I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.669" end="00:18:19.950" style="s2">was thinking about you having to some</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.549" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">degree been in that world and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.950" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">coming out of that world in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:31.169" style="s2">you&#39;re an example of you know is I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:32.669" style="s2">it is it done is it Jordan Hall talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.169" end="00:18:35.580" style="s2">about that is like that that&#39;s all part</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:38.070" style="s2">of the blue church right and and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.580" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">what&#39;s the next one after that is there</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.070" end="00:18:45.059" style="s2">another we talked about the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:47.190" style="s2">being the red religion yeah so the blue</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.059" end="00:18:50.179" style="s2">church I mean I think it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.190" end="00:18:53.250" style="s2">useful frame the blue church being the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.179" end="00:18:55.559" style="s2">institution of not just the media but</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.250" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">also the whole institution of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.559" end="00:19:02.700" style="s2">top-down hierarchy and the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:05.730" style="s2">and all of them academia so Harvard all</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.700" end="00:19:08.789" style="s2">of these systems that were designed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.730" end="00:19:13.710" style="s2">to organize the world after the Second</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.789" end="00:19:15.659" style="s2">World War and the baby they were very</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.710" end="00:19:18.029" style="s2">effective but they also left out certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.659" end="00:19:21.539" style="s2">viewpoints certain perspectives and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.029" end="00:19:23.730" style="s2">was what fueled the insurgency in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.539" end="00:19:24.550" style="s2">red religion and then sort of bubbled up</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.730" end="00:19:29.890" style="s2">with prom</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.550" end="00:19:33.400" style="s2">and brexit what was left out of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.890" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">church synthesis right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.400" end="00:19:36.670" style="s2">what my first film was about what sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.350" style="s2">of the glitch in the matrix was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.670" end="00:19:41.620" style="s2">that these what are these perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.350" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">that are not being reflected in them in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.620" end="00:19:48.040" style="s2">the system that we have which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">affecting the reality is far too complex</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.040" end="00:19:52.420" style="s2">to be contained within any low</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:53.590" style="s2">resolution model yeah and I&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.420" end="00:19:54.970" style="s2">the blue church model was actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.590" end="00:19:56.890" style="s2">fairly high resolution but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.970" end="00:19:59.140" style="s2">not enough and there are certain values</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.890" end="00:20:02.440" style="s2">and certain perspectives that are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.140" end="00:20:07.780" style="s2">included also that there&#39;s a kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.440" end="00:20:09.100" style="s2">becomes corrupt or it becomes corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.780" end="00:20:15.270" style="s2">possibly not the right word but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.100" end="00:20:18.070" style="s2">certainly become yeah the right word</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.270" end="00:20:22.200" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of atrophies a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.070" end="00:20:25.960" style="s2">that trophy&#39;s as time goes by yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.200" end="00:20:28.060" style="s2">and that yeah I guess I mean I&#39;m that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">why I&#39;m most fascinated by I think is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.060" end="00:20:31.680" style="s2">this sort of tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.380" end="00:20:35.290" style="s2">alternative in the mainstream yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.680" end="00:20:36.790" style="s2">also concerned by because this is a film</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.290" end="00:20:38.430" style="s2">that I&#39;m making at the moment about sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.790" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">of the growth of conspiracy theory and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.430" end="00:20:44.920" style="s2">and all of these kind of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:47.320" style="s2">narratives around Ovid which seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.920" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">be just proliferating and you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.320" end="00:20:50.380" style="s2">people who have never sort of shared a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:53.290" style="s2">conspiracy theory before sharing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.380" end="00:20:55.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s a very complex picture</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.290" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">because a lot because some of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.000" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">people say is conspiracy theory is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">actually like I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:03.340" style="s2">everything that&#39;s not like an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">narrative is conspiracy theory because</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.340" end="00:21:08.440" style="s2">some of the mainstream narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:10.360" style="s2">themselves are partial and but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.440" end="00:21:13.020" style="s2">you&#39;ve got what concerns me is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.360" end="00:21:16.810" style="s2">got the situation where we had</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.020" end="00:21:18.490" style="s2">gatekeepers before I won&#39;t perfect but</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.810" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">at least we had some gatekeepers and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.490" end="00:21:22.540" style="s2">there were some very good values held in</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:24.850" style="s2">those gatekeepers yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.540" end="00:21:26.590" style="s2">internalized as a journalist you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.850" end="00:21:30.360" style="s2">like report something you need to check</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.590" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">it factually you need to you need to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.360" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">people&#39;s responses if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:35.160" style="s2">put any allegations you need to get the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">response of where you make</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.160" end="00:21:42.810" style="s2">the allegation about the other and there</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:44.700" style="s2">were enforcement of those especially in</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.810" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">the UK we&#39;ve got off we&#39;ve got a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.700" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">different media landscape than the US</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:51.390" style="s2">but there are genuine checks and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:53.460" style="s2">balances I feel like we&#39;ve gone from one</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.390" end="00:21:55.320" style="s2">place where there were the gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.460" end="00:21:57.420" style="s2">and they there are obviously flaws in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.320" end="00:21:59.970" style="s2">that system but at least there was some</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.420" end="00:22:02.490" style="s2">sense of objective truth right into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.970" end="00:22:04.110" style="s2">world and I can imagine that you go</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.490" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">through this kind of on through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.110" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">valley of kind of the alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:12.060" style="s2">and we may end up with only most of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">crowd thoughts decentralized way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.060" end="00:22:15.780" style="s2">checking truth claims and but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:17.610" style="s2">there yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.780" end="00:22:23.100" style="s2">and we&#39;re in this very dangerous place</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.610" end="00:22:25.860" style="s2">in between one structure and another and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.100" end="00:22:28.680" style="s2">right now we&#39;re in a place where it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.860" end="00:22:32.160" style="s2">feels like a very dangerous time in a in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.680" end="00:22:34.920" style="s2">a in a very dangerous time yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.160" end="00:22:37.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the tech giants now making</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.920" end="00:22:39.900" style="s2">these decisions and they&#39;re doing in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.530" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">very sort of haphazard way but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.900" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">because they&#39;re also benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:46.380" style="s2">like conspiracy stuff or missing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.940" end="00:22:48.840" style="s2">cook the same misinformation rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.380" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">conspiracy missing information can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.840" end="00:22:53.420" style="s2">very viral ready and they&#39;re only really</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:56.310" style="s2">interested in maximizing time on-site</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.420" end="00:22:59.460" style="s2">maximizing shareability of content so</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.310" end="00:23:03.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been there not more into towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.460" end="00:23:06.270" style="s2">truth yeah we&#39;ve got this very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.680" end="00:23:07.980" style="s2">moment when we&#39;ve got actors who are not</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.270" end="00:23:09.450" style="s2">oriented towards truth and though we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.980" end="00:23:12.120" style="s2">got all of these kind of other actors</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.450" end="00:23:15.870" style="s2">including state actors like Russia and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.120" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">China and who are and we&#39;ve got very few</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">checks and balances and it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:23.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve been overwhelmed yeah that for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.580" end="00:23:29.810" style="s2">is very very concerning is that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.060" end="00:23:32.940" style="s2">don&#39;t see I hear like Jordan Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.810" end="00:23:35.060" style="s2">formerly Jordan green wall I think his</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.940" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">narrative is is brilliant about</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.060" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">decentralized media and broadcast and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:43.560" style="s2">also and he talks about kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:46.470" style="s2">death of the blue church but it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.560" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">in there inevitably going towards more</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.470" end="00:23:49.299" style="s2">and more decentralized and then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:52.299" style="s2">destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.299" end="00:23:55.119" style="s2">like the New York Times the all of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.299" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">institutions academia all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.119" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">things are losing their power and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">like I get that but that terrifies me</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:03.429" style="s2">but the valley</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">yeah the valley that we have to cross to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.429" end="00:24:08.649" style="s2">some other way of making sense unless</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:10.659" style="s2">we&#39;re all the idea that we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.649" end="00:24:12.429" style="s2">individually check absolutely everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.659" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">and we all have to rely on a discernment</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.429" end="00:24:17.950" style="s2">while that feels empowering on some</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:20.289" style="s2">level it&#39;s also it&#39;s not possible we all</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.950" end="00:24:23.169" style="s2">proxy our sense making somewhere to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.289" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">something we do we can&#39;t avoid it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.169" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">how we exist as as you humans we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:33.399" style="s2">connect brands and so it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">feels like yeah it feels very very well</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.399" end="00:24:39.639" style="s2">I think that more than anything like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:42.249" style="s2">information landscape and the the lack</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.639" end="00:24:43.929" style="s2">of faith in any authorities who I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.249" end="00:24:46.629" style="s2">to be fair they&#39;ve done an awful lot to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.929" end="00:24:50.289" style="s2">lose that trust I&#39;m not defending the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.629" end="00:24:52.090" style="s2">existing authorities but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.289" end="00:24:54.820" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had no trusted sources</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.090" end="00:24:57.129" style="s2">anymore and cannot even really imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.820" end="00:24:59.320" style="s2">what a trusted source would look like</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.129" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">who would be heard and respected on both</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.320" end="00:25:04.539" style="s2">sides of the political divide or all</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:07.149" style="s2">sides of the blizzard but you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.539" end="00:25:09.369" style="s2">dan Rather before like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.149" end="00:25:11.409" style="s2">figure of someone who is trusted by</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.369" end="00:25:12.730" style="s2">everyone I can&#39;t even imagine what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.409" end="00:25:16.119" style="s2">would look like right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.730" end="00:25:18.669" style="s2">great great he hasn&#39;t was a long rap but</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.119" end="00:25:21.789" style="s2">it&#39;s son yeah well one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.669" end="00:25:25.149" style="s2">said is yeah as a journalist coming from</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.789" end="00:25:29.470" style="s2">that side of the street like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.149" end="00:25:31.299" style="s2">internalized right certain ethics so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.470" end="00:25:33.330" style="s2">that was something that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.299" end="00:25:36.999" style="s2">like you still you still have that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.330" end="00:25:38.440" style="s2">hmm like you still have that yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.999" end="00:25:42.850" style="s2">client would like to say something there</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.440" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">because I think like journalists there</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.850" end="00:25:46.809" style="s2">are values held within turn like good</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:47.619" style="s2">journalism journalistic ethics that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.809" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">think I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.619" end="00:25:53.289" style="s2">we can&#39;t lose those like a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">are very down on journalism and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.289" end="00:25:56.440" style="s2">with a lot of the criticisms by</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.580" end="00:25:58.299" style="s2">journalism as far too easily captured by</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.440" end="00:26:00.279" style="s2">groupthink it&#39;s captured by corporate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.299" end="00:26:02.830" style="s2">interests is captured by a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.279" end="00:26:04.390" style="s2">a lot of these are the factor</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.830" end="00:26:08.260" style="s2">but but if you break down what</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.390" end="00:26:11.710" style="s2">journalism should be about kind of good</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.260" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">treatment of information yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.710" end="00:26:16.769" style="s2">really valuable things they&#39;re valuable</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:20.380" style="s2">practices and they&#39;re valuable</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.769" end="00:26:23.230" style="s2">values and the practices like I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.380" end="00:26:25.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve been tracking like the the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.230" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">intellectual darkweb for example yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.510" end="00:26:31.320" style="s2">which is for people who maybe don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:33.850" style="s2">is is a kind of loose conglomeration of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.320" end="00:26:36.039" style="s2">podcasts and alternative media figures</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.850" end="00:26:41.980" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen them go through this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.039" end="00:26:44.409" style="s2">process of real world learning that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.980" end="00:26:45.850" style="s2">have to have these values you saw it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.409" end="00:26:48.519" style="s2">with someone like Joe Rogan who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.850" end="00:26:51.370" style="s2">biggest podcaster in the world he he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.519" end="00:26:53.980" style="s2">went through this process with he had</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.370" end="00:26:56.590" style="s2">Jack Dorsey the head of Twitter on his</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.980" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">podcast and it was a crappy interview</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.590" end="00:27:00.970" style="s2">Jack Dorsey just basically stonewalled</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:02.409" style="s2">everything and just was and Joe after</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.970" end="00:27:05.470" style="s2">was kind of like yeah it was a crappy</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.409" end="00:27:06.610" style="s2">interview but his audience just turned</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.470" end="00:27:08.019" style="s2">on him in a way that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.610" end="00:27:10.990" style="s2">experienced before because they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.019" end="00:27:13.029" style="s2">like you didn&#39;t hold him to account you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.990" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">Twitter have been censoring people</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.029" end="00:27:18.519" style="s2">they&#39;ve been banning people you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:21.789" style="s2">and Joe was like whoa I just get people</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.519" end="00:27:23.260" style="s2">on to my I just built the show by</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.789" end="00:27:24.700" style="s2">getting on people I want to talk to and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.260" end="00:27:28.330" style="s2">having a conversation with them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.700" end="00:27:30.519" style="s2">suddenly my audience is yeah me a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.330" end="00:27:33.100" style="s2">traitor calling me a sellout calling me</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.519" end="00:27:36.549" style="s2">a shill for not asking Jack Dorsey in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.100" end="00:27:38.740" style="s2">holding into account all of these topics</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.549" end="00:27:40.539" style="s2">and Joe you saw him go through this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.740" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">really that&#39;s what I really respect</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.539" end="00:27:46.029" style="s2">about Joe Rogan is that he went through</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">this process of self analysis and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.029" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">water I didn&#39;t ask for this job but now</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:54.100" style="s2">I&#39;m being expected to do this job yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:56.919" style="s2">and he he did he did the interview Jack</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.100" end="00:28:01.090" style="s2">Dorsey again and got on a journalist Tim</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.919" end="00:28:03.250" style="s2">Paul to to basically have a go at Jack</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.090" end="00:28:05.500" style="s2">Dorsey so he did but he was learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.250" end="00:28:08.380" style="s2">effectively that he was a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.500" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">without realising he had certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.380" end="00:28:13.090" style="s2">abilities to his audience that he never</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:16.820" style="s2">asked for I think a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.090" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">alternative media space are learning the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.820" end="00:28:21.830" style="s2">it reach comes with responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:25.419" style="s2">okay you have a certain number of if</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.830" end="00:28:25.419" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a few million subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.630" end="00:28:29.750" style="s2">there are different responsibilities to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.580" end="00:28:31.610" style="s2">that in the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.750" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">Eric Weinstein talks about this really</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:37.639" style="s2">well he says a lot of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">old media inherited their positions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.639" end="00:28:42.529" style="s2">so then the journalists themselves they</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:45.019" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of reach but the New</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.529" end="00:28:47.000" style="s2">York Times has a lot of reach they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.019" end="00:28:47.830" style="s2">inherited their positions and he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.000" end="00:28:49.970" style="s2">that they probably have a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.830" end="00:28:52.490" style="s2">responsibility too</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.970" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">yes someone who&#39;s built their platform</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.490" end="00:28:56.120" style="s2">by hand or their Twitter account by hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:28:58.490" style="s2">there probably is a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.120" end="00:29:00.259" style="s2">responsibilities but if you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.490" end="00:29:01.639" style="s2">hundred thousand a million followers I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.259" end="00:29:03.860" style="s2">think you do have a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.639" end="00:29:06.289" style="s2">responsibilities mm-hmm they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.860" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">different but what we&#39;re seeing right</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.289" end="00:29:11.269" style="s2">now with coronavirus and misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:12.590" style="s2">is that everyone in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.269" end="00:29:14.750" style="s2">you could affect someone as you go out</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.590" end="00:29:16.250" style="s2">like you&#39;re not just keeping your safe</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.750" end="00:29:17.629" style="s2">self from the virus you&#39;re keeping other</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.250" end="00:29:19.460" style="s2">people safe from the virus and not</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.629" end="00:29:21.289" style="s2">becoming a vector I think everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.460" end="00:29:23.210" style="s2">now getting a visceral understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.289" end="00:29:28.519" style="s2">that you can also be a vector for</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.210" end="00:29:31.519" style="s2">misinformation yeah yeah if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.519" end="00:29:33.620" style="s2">realizing that I think we are then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.519" end="00:29:36.379" style="s2">also realizing that some people are much</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.620" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">more toxic vectors for information than</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.379" end="00:29:42.919" style="s2">others mm-hmm yeah I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:45.860" style="s2">something we&#39;re learning very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.919" end="00:29:47.830" style="s2">right now you know it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.860" end="00:29:52.129" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an interesting time when</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.830" end="00:29:57.590" style="s2">when being a journalist ISM anamur is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.129" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">emergent property lega Rogan it emerged</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.590" end="00:30:02.659" style="s2">for him that he&#39;s a journalist he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">finding his his way which is really I</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.659" end="00:30:05.389" style="s2">think one of the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:08.659" style="s2">interesting is like who is the audience</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.389" end="00:30:10.840" style="s2">in this world right so what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.659" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">things I&#39;ve had this thought about about</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.840" end="00:30:17.629" style="s2">you know watching Peterson was and I get</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:19.970" style="s2">that people have different opinions</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.629" end="00:30:22.639" style="s2">about this but like I mean I like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.970" end="00:30:24.889" style="s2">I like him I mean I just have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.639" end="00:30:27.500" style="s2">respect for like how he would just walk</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.889" end="00:30:28.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if he was if he knew who he</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.500" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">was talking to and he was talking but he</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.940" end="00:30:35.539" style="s2">used to walk in and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">would just confront the hypocrisy right</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.539" end="00:30:39.710" style="s2">he would even couldn&#39;t and he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:42.019" style="s2">any you would just stay to the truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:43.340" style="s2">that it was a great example of that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.019" end="00:30:45.769" style="s2">one of the things that I think was</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.340" end="00:30:49.909" style="s2">started to happen at least in my view at</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.769" end="00:30:52.610" style="s2">the end sometimes right was actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.909" end="00:30:55.880" style="s2">something that he used to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.610" end="00:30:59.870" style="s2">his in his class when he would talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.880" end="00:31:01.730" style="s2">about that Hitler right was it just he</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.870" end="00:31:04.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t come out like Hitler and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.730" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">insert something on the world no like</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.279" end="00:31:08.870" style="s2">there was there was an evolution where</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:11.779" style="s2">certain things he would say he would get</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.870" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">like a cheer and so on some level not</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.779" end="00:31:17.659" style="s2">even like it&#39;s the conscious level but</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:20.899" style="s2">just in in the dance of co-creating you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.659" end="00:31:25.309" style="s2">know Germany and and Hitler co-created</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.899" end="00:31:27.049" style="s2">each other at that that time and I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.309" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">actually kind of watching as time went</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.049" end="00:31:34.909" style="s2">on like he it seemed to me that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:37.730" style="s2">talked a lot more his audience got</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.909" end="00:31:39.950" style="s2">really like against the post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.730" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">right against those people right and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.950" end="00:31:44.870" style="s2">got a lot of a lot of applause for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">and he just it occurred to me that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.870" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">started he started taking the language</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:54.740" style="s2">of more and more polarization in a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:58.580" style="s2">that I think that that was very similar</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.740" end="00:32:00.230" style="s2">to that same dynamic right so he had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.580" end="00:32:02.299" style="s2">real cult following and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.230" end="00:32:04.039" style="s2">he&#39;s I&#39;m not calling him Hitler or</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.299" end="00:32:05.720" style="s2">anything like that but there&#39;s a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.039" end="00:32:09.590" style="s2">that there&#39;s a Co shaping what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.720" end="00:32:11.480" style="s2">on right and so you just gave an example</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.590" end="00:32:16.519" style="s2">of where that went really well</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.480" end="00:32:21.049" style="s2">right with a reasonably well with Hogan</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.519" end="00:32:23.720" style="s2">right where he has his interview he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.049" end="00:32:26.630" style="s2">just doing his thing right and then he</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.720" end="00:32:29.450" style="s2">gets he starts to get but he but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.630" end="00:32:31.549" style="s2">was a conscious thing that he confronted</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.450" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">and made adjustments around and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.549" end="00:32:34.970" style="s2">sees himself differently through that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:36.830" style="s2">like that&#39;s really is this like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:38.120" style="s2">that in itself is just an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.830" end="00:32:42.440" style="s2">thing that you could that can just</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:44.539" style="s2">happen or emerge for you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.440" end="00:32:46.279" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting dynamic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.539" end="00:32:49.130" style="s2">coming up or thinking about as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.279" end="00:32:52.059" style="s2">talking which is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.130" end="00:32:54.649" style="s2">antifragility which is that more</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.059" end="00:32:57.380" style="s2">conflict makes us stronger and there</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.649" end="00:33:01.909" style="s2">seems to be a parallel there in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.380" end="00:33:04.309" style="s2">does criticism do we shrink under</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.909" end="00:33:07.159" style="s2">criticism and just retreat into I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.309" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">best and this person&#39;s wrong and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.159" end="00:33:11.149" style="s2">know why they&#39;re saying that anyway or</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.870" end="00:33:14.059" style="s2">do we actually are we able to grow into</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.149" end="00:33:15.830" style="s2">criticism and and that is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.059" end="00:33:17.889" style="s2">again just referring back to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.830" end="00:33:21.620" style="s2">intellectual dark web you saw very</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.889" end="00:33:25.460" style="s2">different trajectories between Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.620" end="00:33:26.929" style="s2">and Dave Rubin Dave Rubin I&#39;ve been high</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.460" end="00:33:32.929" style="s2">I&#39;ve done an interview with him where I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.929" end="00:33:34.750" style="s2">was I was quite challenging and he one</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.929" end="00:33:36.590" style="s2">thing I think it&#39;s fairly are</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.750" end="00:33:38.179" style="s2">non-controversial to say the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.590" end="00:33:41.299" style="s2">debut is not very good that was taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.179" end="00:33:46.190" style="s2">criticism he does seem to have a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.299" end="00:33:47.480" style="s2">strong narcissistic edge and he even on</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.190" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">like he&#39;s been he&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.480" end="00:33:52.610" style="s2">thin-skinned yeah and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.019" style="s2">because he&#39;s talked about I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.610" end="00:33:55.669" style="s2">took her over and talked about how he</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.019" end="00:33:58.970" style="s2">was kind of he hinted that he was sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.669" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">of mentally not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.970" end="00:34:06.049" style="s2">did he say something like attract to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:09.169" style="s2">pretty done it&#39;s a kind of stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.049" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">that comes from there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.169" end="00:34:13.220" style="s2">stability that comes from not being able</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:15.889" style="s2">to take criticism that is that means</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.220" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">that you get stuck yeah and that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.889" end="00:34:19.490" style="s2">noticed quite a lot since I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:23.780" style="s2">get more into personal growth like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.490" end="00:34:26.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a type of stupidity that is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.780" end="00:34:29.389" style="s2">lack of fabric cognitive ability that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.780" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">people have more or less of but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.389" end="00:34:33.349" style="s2">a there&#39;s a certain there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:37.270" style="s2">type of intelligence that just comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.349" end="00:34:41.210" style="s2">from being able to grow in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.270" end="00:34:43.220" style="s2">criticism openness yeah and challenge</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.210" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">that I see with someone like Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.220" end="00:34:46.940" style="s2">and actually it makes Joe Rogan a a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:50.119" style="s2">really intelligent interviewer and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.940" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">really like he you&#39;d be the first to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.119" end="00:34:53.540" style="s2">he&#39;s not a philosopher is no he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:55.879" style="s2">particularly deep thinker but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.540" end="00:34:58.130" style="s2">naturally a very very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.879" end="00:35:00.710" style="s2">interviewer because he&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.130" end="00:35:03.950" style="s2">growing and he&#39;s constantly learning and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.710" end="00:35:05.779" style="s2">he&#39;s also got a very good sense for what</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.950" end="00:35:09.170" style="s2">and someone is getting stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.779" end="00:35:10.849" style="s2">certainty and you see like his some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:13.279" style="s2">his interviews he&#39;s actually picking up</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.849" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">very intuitively when someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.279" end="00:35:16.009" style="s2">know what they&#39;re talking about because</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">he can kind of sense into what their</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.009" end="00:35:21.259" style="s2">great kind of speaking from a very fixed</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.490" end="00:35:25.880" style="s2">position or they&#39;re all they&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.259" end="00:35:27.980" style="s2">just quite gently yeah you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.880" end="00:35:29.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something in the no view of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.980" end="00:35:31.460" style="s2">like there&#39;s almost two different types</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.900" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">of intelligence there there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.460" end="00:35:35.539" style="s2">becoming fixated in a person in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:38.569" style="s2">position means that you stop growing</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.539" end="00:35:40.490" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m aware of where that is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.569" end="00:35:42.859" style="s2">you can happen at any point like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.490" end="00:35:45.170" style="s2">another another really interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.859" end="00:35:46.670" style="s2">is that we don&#39;t know like when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.170" end="00:35:49.069" style="s2">a relationship with someone and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.670" end="00:35:52.190" style="s2">growing and we just get us too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.069" end="00:35:54.140" style="s2">call wound maybe all right I can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.190" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">beyond there right now right</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.140" end="00:35:59.869" style="s2">I don&#39;t accept that responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:02.839" style="s2">the dynamic of water mine here yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.869" end="00:36:04.849" style="s2">so many relationships it&#39;s great I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.839" end="00:36:07.579" style="s2">if anything it&#39;s a great it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.849" end="00:36:10.069" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve never quite looked at</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.579" end="00:36:12.349" style="s2">it from the lens of that that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.069" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">actually affecting a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.349" end="00:36:19.339" style="s2">intelligence or or acuity right a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:22.490" style="s2">perception but that makes sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.339" end="00:36:26.299" style="s2">like if there&#39;s uh if we call it a kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.490" end="00:36:28.910" style="s2">of narcissism where where my ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.299" end="00:36:32.559" style="s2">my way of thinking is so wrapped up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.910" end="00:36:36.380" style="s2">who I need to see myself as right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.559" end="00:36:38.329" style="s2">therefore if that&#39;s the case I&#39;ll only</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.380" end="00:36:41.509" style="s2">be around people and talk with people</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.329" end="00:36:43.549" style="s2">that are will mirror that to me so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.509" end="00:36:45.890" style="s2">not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a knowledge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.549" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">not a knowledge that I&#39;m learning it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.890" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">knowledge I&#39;m imposing getting mirrored</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:56.839" style="s2">yeah and if if I open up if if if I am</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">that image and I need its reflection if</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.839" end="00:37:01.849" style="s2">I open up the criticism right if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.630" end="00:37:05.390" style="s2">really identified I can&#39;t tolerate it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.849" end="00:37:07.430" style="s2">right so I&#39;ll make it or make them wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.390" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">or avoid them or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.430" end="00:37:12.940" style="s2">then just be around the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:15.850" style="s2">that will you know concur with me and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.940" end="00:37:17.350" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right like there&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.850" end="00:37:19.420" style="s2">very different thing whereas what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.350" end="00:37:23.410" style="s2">takes to actually open up the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:28.300" style="s2">and the criticism and to exposure and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.410" end="00:37:31.510" style="s2">take criticism it it&#39;s well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.300" end="00:37:32.680" style="s2">character mmm let&#39;s character it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.510" end="00:37:34.630" style="s2">being able to go through something</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.680" end="00:37:37.030" style="s2">difficult that you don&#39;t understand and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.630" end="00:37:39.070" style="s2">then lean into it and take a look and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.030" end="00:37:42.190" style="s2">adjust and that interaction or that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.070" end="00:37:45.700" style="s2">conversation seems to be what makes our</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.190" end="00:37:48.490" style="s2">character seems yeah it is character but</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.700" end="00:37:51.790" style="s2">it&#39;s also infinitely more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.490" end="00:37:55.840" style="s2">do that if we have a public persona or</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.790" end="00:37:58.390" style="s2">we have a public profile you know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.840" end="00:38:00.700" style="s2">seems to be very very difficult you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.390" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">do yeah as we get identified with</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.700" end="00:38:06.490" style="s2">certain perspectives and admitting that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:08.310" style="s2">we&#39;re wrong in public and even even just</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.490" end="00:38:11.590" style="s2">the sheer data</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.310" end="00:38:14.860" style="s2">overwhelm of however many people telling</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.590" end="00:38:16.590" style="s2">us that we&#39;re great and maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.860" end="00:38:20.890" style="s2">people telling us that we&#39;re not and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.590" end="00:38:23.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve then got we&#39;ve got an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.890" end="00:38:25.420" style="s2">amount of perspectives and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.800" end="00:38:27.160" style="s2">easy to sort of select only the ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.420" end="00:38:32.760" style="s2">that tell us that we&#39;re great and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.160" end="00:38:32.760" style="s2">more everyone else like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.610" end="00:38:41.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not something I have a suspicion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.470" end="00:38:42.940" style="s2">just becoming really famous almost it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.380" end="00:38:47.620" style="s2">almost impossible not to have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.940" end="00:38:50.680" style="s2">feedback loop disrupted quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.620" end="00:38:52.420" style="s2">fundamentally yeah yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.680" end="00:38:54.910" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m wondering about so it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.420" end="00:38:56.650" style="s2">seemed like when we said when he started</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.910" end="00:38:59.080" style="s2">when you brought up the thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.650" end="00:39:05.740" style="s2">like the intelligence aspect right or</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.080" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">rolling right yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.740" end="00:39:12.700" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of a peninsula did</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:16.470" style="s2">the conversation shifted right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.700" end="00:39:20.370" style="s2">like both like oh there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.470" end="00:39:21.790" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve thought about however</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.370" end="00:39:23.800" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.790" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">in the dialog something came up and now</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.800" end="00:39:26.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s kind of like there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:28.990" style="s2">a sense of like we&#39;re bringing things</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.680" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">together and articulating them in new</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.990" end="00:39:38.110" style="s2">ways so to me that is whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:40.450" style="s2">and and being able to have these</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.110" end="00:39:43.690" style="s2">conversations this is I guess is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.450" end="00:39:45.190" style="s2">you would call sense making right what</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.690" end="00:39:47.110" style="s2">John and I had been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.190" end="00:39:49.930" style="s2">is like dial logos right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.110" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">not just dialogue like relating but</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.930" end="00:39:54.340" style="s2">actually where we we encounter a place</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:57.430" style="s2">where all of a sudden we start to learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.340" end="00:39:59.710" style="s2">more than the sum of the two of us knew</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.430" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">right so that&#39;s one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.710" end="00:40:06.820" style="s2">just been like fighting myself zeroing</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:08.200" style="s2">in on on what I&#39;m doing with with with</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.820" end="00:40:11.580" style="s2">I&#39;m still finding out what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.200" end="00:40:14.350" style="s2">right in terms of these videos and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.580" end="00:40:18.930" style="s2">but I&#39;m I&#39;m wondering about like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.350" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">sent to me it sounds like from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:24.670" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you say that like your</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:29.260" style="s2">inclination to do the the practice work</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.670" end="00:40:31.270" style="s2">with people right I wouldn&#39;t you say</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.260" end="00:40:34.450" style="s2">that a lot of that practice work is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.270" end="00:40:38.650" style="s2">precisely about being able to open up to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.450" end="00:40:41.380" style="s2">the other tolerate ambiguity tell the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.650" end="00:40:45.790" style="s2">truth and stay with what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.380" end="00:40:51.130" style="s2">make sense of it as it happens yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.790" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">that&#39;s very much yeah that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.130" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">that the skill set that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">learning so I did a counseling training</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:41:03.850" style="s2">based around inquiry so inquiry I know</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:08.470" style="s2">that you each almost like kind of based</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.850" end="00:41:12.150" style="s2">nebulous but I mean it sort of feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.470" end="00:41:15.690" style="s2">like it has the same origin as something</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.150" end="00:41:20.020" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not exactly cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.690" end="00:41:21.730" style="s2">basically dialogue and so kind of trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.020" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">to get to the edge of our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.730" end="00:41:26.620" style="s2">and find new words for things and what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.090" style="s2">found I didn&#39;t really put this together</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.620" end="00:41:30.130" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know whether we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.090" end="00:41:31.180" style="s2">it before but it maybe not because I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.130" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">think this was a real eyes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.180" end="00:41:38.710" style="s2">and I had relatively recently which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:40.329" style="s2">that by so the counseling training I did</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.710" end="00:41:42.130" style="s2">was based around inquiry so we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.329" end="00:41:44.050" style="s2">doing an awful lot of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.130" end="00:41:46.420" style="s2">sense of like following the thread of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.050" end="00:41:47.950" style="s2">our unfolding experience and learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.420" end="00:41:51.010" style="s2">something new about ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.950" end="00:41:53.470" style="s2">dialogue with someone else and circling</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.010" end="00:41:57.849" style="s2">around particular topics and really</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.470" end="00:42:00.280" style="s2">integrating that kind of way of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.849" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">that way of understanding and then what</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.280" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">I realized was oh that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:08.109" style="s2">was fueling rebel wisdom what was</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:10.030" style="s2">fueling the exploration was okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.109" end="00:42:13.390" style="s2">the and they sort of sense of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.030" end="00:42:15.910" style="s2">Pederson being the first like really</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.390" end="00:42:16.990" style="s2">emergent thing of like whoa this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.910" end="00:42:20.020" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.990" end="00:42:22.930" style="s2">yeah just you&#39;re the Petersons I got I</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.020" end="00:42:27.490" style="s2">found when I first discovered Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.930" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">Pederson in 2017 I knew immediately this</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.490" end="00:42:34.450" style="s2">is going this is the thing this is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:36.940" style="s2">thing that we need that the world needs</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.450" end="00:42:39.579" style="s2">to hear right now like the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.940" end="00:42:42.299" style="s2">mythological and not the anti woke start</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.579" end="00:42:45.329" style="s2">from the really kind of anti pomo</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.299" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">material although I think that was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.329" end="00:42:49.660" style="s2">there was mean there was signal there</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">for sure but it was more like the deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.660" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:59.140" style="s2">of a culture someone arguing for the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">truth of the religious experience at and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.140" end="00:43:03.220" style="s2">psychedelics and all these things in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:05.650" style="s2">public arena as the most high-profile</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.220" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">intellectual that&#39;s an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.650" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">thing yeah and so following so that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:13.210" style="s2">the first like okay this emergent thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">and then reflecting on that phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.210" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">that then erupted on your show that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:22.299" style="s2">used to work on for ten years which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:24.819" style="s2">like okay pull that one together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.299" end="00:43:26.260" style="s2">the whole conversation I had the Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.869" end="00:43:42.460" style="s2">okay make sense of that synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.490" end="00:43:44.390" style="s2">and then following the thread of okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.460" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2">following that sense that okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.390" end="00:43:50.359" style="s2">the emergent thing right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.240" end="00:43:54.260" style="s2">that took me on to the likes of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.359" end="00:43:58.730" style="s2">Hall Jamie wheel mm-hmm Mountain burger</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.260" end="00:44:00.559" style="s2">and many other systems thinkers whose</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.730" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">rid what&#39;s the real cutting edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.559" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">conversation and the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:12.049" style="s2">web as well and I&#39;ve also made it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:13.789" style="s2">also going to put a link to a gave a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.049" end="00:44:17.089" style="s2">talk about the intellectual dark webbing</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.789" end="00:44:19.460" style="s2">in New York to a university where I kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.089" end="00:44:20.660" style="s2">of like that that sense of the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.460" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">with the intellectual dart live I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.660" end="00:44:26.990" style="s2">ended quite soon after it was named yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:29.000" style="s2">yeah but then I look around at some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.990" end="00:44:31.010" style="s2">the people that we&#39;re also good friends</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.000" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">with I&#39;m sure that we we know many of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.010" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">the same people people who are practiced</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">in this kind of psycho technology also</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:43.190" style="s2">seem to be attracted to some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:46.609" style="s2">conversations yeah like once you develop</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.190" end="00:44:48.619" style="s2">this as a tool yeah in yourself yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.609" end="00:44:51.500" style="s2">think you then start to be able to track</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.619" end="00:44:55.009" style="s2">what is new and emergent and the culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.500" end="00:44:56.990" style="s2">as well totally so there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.009" end="00:44:59.329" style="s2">something about like just as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.990" end="00:45:02.920" style="s2">talking about it when you said yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.329" end="00:45:06.410" style="s2">knew what Jordan Peterson that this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.920" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">this is this is worth or a pulsus right</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.410" end="00:45:14.410" style="s2">and he just went towards it before that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:17.420" style="s2">right before that like in your life</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.410" end="00:45:22.130" style="s2">hmm what were you up to like what were</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.420" end="00:45:24.500" style="s2">you doing before you saw that and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.130" end="00:45:27.289" style="s2">your attention went with Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.500" end="00:45:29.750" style="s2">in the beginning of all of this what who</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.289" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">were you what were you doing why why did</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.750" end="00:45:38.359" style="s2">you exist what was happening so</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:44.569" style="s2">immediately before I was very passionate</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.359" end="00:45:47.410" style="s2">about men&#39;s work and we still some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.569" end="00:45:49.609" style="s2">the so we treat we teach retreats and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.410" end="00:45:52.460" style="s2">transformational work and we still up</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.609" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">until this code situation we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.460" end="00:45:58.210" style="s2">men&#39;s retreats I&#39;m very passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:45:58.210" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.280" end="00:46:04.910" style="s2">and before that I&#39;ve been sort of while</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:08.870" style="s2">I was at Channel 4 News I&#39;m doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.910" end="00:46:13.250" style="s2">of foreign affairs and the Arab Spring</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.870" end="00:46:17.300" style="s2">and then left to do documentaries mostly</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.250" end="00:46:19.970" style="s2">about foreign affairs and also I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.300" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">also very interested in okay I pinched a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.970" end="00:46:27.350" style="s2">few documentaries that never really got</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">made about more spiritual topics I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.350" end="00:46:34.760" style="s2">also interested in the the the nexus</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:36.590" style="s2">between spirituality and mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.760" end="00:46:38.950" style="s2">that was something I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.590" end="00:46:41.270" style="s2">interested in growth</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.950" end="00:46:44.540" style="s2">Stanislav Grof we maybe people might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.270" end="00:46:48.830" style="s2">familiar with he talked about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.540" end="00:46:50.180" style="s2">emergencies and just this sense of I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.830" end="00:46:55.610" style="s2">always interested in what are the one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.180" end="00:46:58.690" style="s2">the areas of culture where a more</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.610" end="00:47:01.580" style="s2">expansive conception of humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.690" end="00:47:04.010" style="s2">pushing through so for me some of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.580" end="00:47:06.530" style="s2">areas were psychedelic therapy so I get</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.010" end="00:47:10.370" style="s2">the first piece about psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.530" end="00:47:11.030" style="s2">therapy back in 2008 on mainstream TV in</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.370" end="00:47:13.400" style="s2">the UK</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.030" end="00:47:15.970" style="s2">who&#39;s got MDMA therapy and results for</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.400" end="00:47:20.300" style="s2">the shown that it worked very well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.970" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">like why is the psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.300" end="00:47:26.840" style="s2">so therapeutically valuable that for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:29.860" style="s2">shows like how narrow the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.840" end="00:47:34.360" style="s2">reductive reductionist conception of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.860" end="00:47:37.310" style="s2">people of the person is from kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.360" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">materialistic medicine you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.310" end="00:47:42.890" style="s2">one one area yeah other area is the sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:47.420" style="s2">of idea of spiritual emergencies and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.890" end="00:47:49.190" style="s2">just the like psychiatry is an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.420" end="00:47:54.200" style="s2">car crash as far as I&#39;m concerned what</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.190" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">we have no we have no like yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.200" end="00:48:00.500" style="s2">dealing with complex systems like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">psyche I think we&#39;re going to look back</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.500" end="00:48:05.180" style="s2">and say that what we would do what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">been doing with drugs in the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.620" end="00:48:17.640" style="s2">in the Middle Ages you just do not</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.990" end="00:48:20.040" style="s2">understand the psyche we do not</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.640" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">understand the self-healing nature of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.040" end="00:48:29.930" style="s2">the psyche we do not understand like the</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.490" end="00:48:44.610" style="s2">what sometimes gets very amorphous the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.880" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">idea of paradigm shift yeah where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.610" end="00:48:49.470" style="s2">being from when I study philosophy I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:52.590" style="s2">always had this sort of sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.470" end="00:48:55.140" style="s2">the new paradigm looks like and then I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.590" end="00:48:59.160" style="s2">think together with having sort of home</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.140" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">the idea honed a sense of where the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.160" end="00:49:07.110" style="s2">conversation is I think that&#39;s my that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:09.300" style="s2">that&#39;s my solution that&#39;s where what my</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.110" end="00:49:12.060" style="s2">background has allowed me like being in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.300" end="00:49:13.290" style="s2">a newsroom for 10 15 years and just</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.060" end="00:49:15.270" style="s2">getting a sense of where the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.290" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">conversation is where it gets stuck</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.270" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">where the sort of gatekeepers are of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:22.020" style="s2">certain ways of sort of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.930" end="00:49:24.420" style="s2">conversation or where it needs to shift</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.020" end="00:49:26.910" style="s2">to and how it why it gets stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.420" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">certain place I think that&#39;s what what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.910" end="00:49:31.860" style="s2">got from that experience of being in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:33.810" style="s2">newsroom right well it sounds like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.860" end="00:49:34.350" style="s2">I think what I&#39;m hearing you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.810" end="00:49:37.820" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.350" end="00:49:40.530" style="s2">um it&#39;s fractal in a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.820" end="00:49:41.790" style="s2">that we talked about with you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.530" end="00:49:43.500" style="s2">interesting because it sounds like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.790" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2">figure one of the figures in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.500" end="00:49:49.020" style="s2">intellectual dark web right that then</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:50.760" style="s2">you&#39;re like this went this dis did not</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.020" end="00:49:54.420" style="s2">go he did not go in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.760" end="00:49:56.460" style="s2">right he&#39;s exemplifying it was with was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.420" end="00:49:59.700" style="s2">David Rubin right and you had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.460" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">interview with them but he stood out for</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.700" end="00:50:06.360" style="s2">you as doing something different right</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:08.430" style="s2">then what you that what you were you had</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.360" end="00:50:10.680" style="s2">your eye on right and then we got to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.430" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">conversation about like another an</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.680" end="00:50:16.110" style="s2">opposite example of that is Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:18.030" style="s2">right who just you know comedian just</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.110" end="00:50:21.420" style="s2">having his friends on got really popular</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.030" end="00:50:23.490" style="s2">and then the guy from Twitter comes on</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.420" end="00:50:25.800" style="s2">and he&#39;s censoring it and then his whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:28.710" style="s2">fan base kind of turned on him a bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.800" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">and then he juror ovens used to being</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.710" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">punched in the face that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.110" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:36.420" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve linked it to John reveille</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.110" end="00:50:39.480" style="s2">keys idea about embodied by different</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.210" end="00:51:38.220" style="s2">like the light side which was he didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.190" end="00:51:43.590" style="s2">like well this is not what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.600" end="00:51:44.970" style="s2">maybe I need to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.590" end="00:51:47.490" style="s2">responsibility because it&#39;s here because</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.970" end="00:51:50.060" style="s2">maybe now I&#39;m a journalist now right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.490" end="00:51:52.650" style="s2">he&#39;s and then he had him back on and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.060" end="00:51:54.380" style="s2">then he then you were they you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.650" end="00:51:57.450" style="s2">tracking him being able to track</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.380" end="00:51:59.550" style="s2">conversations which have a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.450" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">more of that gatekeeper quality or not</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.550" end="00:52:06.810" style="s2">gatekeeper but the the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:09.240" style="s2">internalized from from being a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.810" end="00:52:11.010" style="s2">journalist of a certain amount of facts</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.240" end="00:52:13.890" style="s2">like you started to notice his bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.010" end="00:52:15.390" style="s2">indicator started to and in his own way</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.890" end="00:52:19.220" style="s2">he started to highlight that so if</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.390" end="00:52:21.390" style="s2">you&#39;re tracking all of that right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.220" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.390" end="00:52:27.060" style="s2">about what I really heard it when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:32.910" style="s2">when you talked about before before</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.060" end="00:52:35.660" style="s2">rebel wisdom you had tried to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.910" end="00:52:38.500" style="s2">documentaries abroad in con spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.660" end="00:52:41.380" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.500" end="00:52:44.310" style="s2">and psychiatry right the intersections</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.380" end="00:52:46.870" style="s2">between those two things</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.310" end="00:52:50.380" style="s2">and it sounds like I would imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.870" end="00:52:52.270" style="s2">you just couldn&#39;t get the the credit the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.380" end="00:52:54.580" style="s2">media that at the time was just not what</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.270" end="00:52:56.080" style="s2">was going I&#39;m not gonna do this was it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.580" end="00:53:03.340" style="s2">did you get turned down a lot on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.080" end="00:53:08.470" style="s2">of projects er yeah I mean the windows</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.340" end="00:53:10.180" style="s2">for those kind of yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.470" end="00:53:12.520" style="s2">difficult to get something that is going</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.180" end="00:53:14.500" style="s2">against the dominant narrative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.520" end="00:53:15.940" style="s2">because you can always like for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.500" end="00:53:20.860" style="s2">with something if you&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.940" end="00:53:22.870" style="s2">about the links between spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.860" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">experience and mental illness for</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.870" end="00:53:28.210" style="s2">example then you&#39;ve got to face the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:29.800" style="s2">argument that are you telling people</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.210" end="00:53:31.510" style="s2">that they should stop taking their</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.800" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">medication and that is a hugely</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.510" end="00:53:34.870" style="s2">dangerous thing to be putting out there</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:38.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to be responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.870" end="00:53:42.910" style="s2">that kind of argument okay that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.380" end="00:53:44.590" style="s2">thing it&#39;s very difficult when there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.910" end="00:53:46.990" style="s2">an openness now I think to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.590" end="00:53:48.070" style="s2">conversations and also there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.990" end="00:53:49.480" style="s2">truth in that you&#39;ve got to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.070" end="00:53:51.940" style="s2">well you gotta be careful with those</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.480" end="00:53:57.270" style="s2">kind of arguments you you you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.940" end="00:54:00.390" style="s2">I think a lot of a lot of people in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.270" end="00:54:03.550" style="s2">sort of psychologists and people in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.390" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">medical system are aware whether the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.550" end="00:54:09.850" style="s2">strong and materialist</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:12.310" style="s2">paradigm that you&#39;re you&#39;re what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.850" end="00:54:13.870" style="s2">on is just brain chemistry and it has no</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.310" end="00:54:16.210" style="s2">meaning to what&#39;s going on in your life</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.870" end="00:54:17.980" style="s2">that&#39;s not there are not many people we</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.210" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">really think that most people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.980" end="00:54:22.600" style="s2">actually in some kind of a understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:24.550" style="s2">that obviously your life experiences</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.600" end="00:54:28.600" style="s2">influence you in some way but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.550" end="00:54:31.930" style="s2">also operating within a paradigm that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.600" end="00:54:37.000" style="s2">pretty much reliant on drugs yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.930" end="00:54:38.950" style="s2">and nothing else yes yes very like those</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.000" end="00:54:40.660" style="s2">overworked doctors will prescribe you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.950" end="00:54:42.550" style="s2">antidepressants almost immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.660" end="00:54:43.870" style="s2">will not prescribe you talking therapies</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.550" end="00:54:47.470" style="s2">to understand what&#39;s going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.870" end="00:54:50.800" style="s2">life or yeah so you&#39;re you&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.470" end="00:54:52.549" style="s2">certain you&#39;re fighting against a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.800" end="00:54:57.619" style="s2">well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.549" end="00:55:01.429" style="s2">hmm system which has then huge financial</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.619" end="00:55:03.140" style="s2">interests which has huge yeah inertia in</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.429" end="00:55:04.819" style="s2">a certain direction I mean there are all</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.140" end="00:55:07.099" style="s2">of these different factors involved</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.819" end="00:55:08.509" style="s2">right what and one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.099" end="00:55:10.729" style="s2">just want to highlight what what looks</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.509" end="00:55:12.679" style="s2">fractal to me right like a through line</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.729" end="00:55:15.820" style="s2">that I&#39;m hearing I think I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.679" end="00:55:17.860" style="s2">with you as</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.820" end="00:55:20.260" style="s2">he&#39;s like even there you were noticing</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.860" end="00:55:23.560" style="s2">you were noticing okay here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.260" end="00:55:26.590" style="s2">that&#39;s scientific ray psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.560" end="00:55:30.490" style="s2">they&#39;re addressing things in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.590" end="00:55:34.140" style="s2">science that are missing this whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.490" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">other world right that can&#39;t be deduced</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.140" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">scientifically let&#39;s say so you and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:43.570" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that you had both</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:46.150" style="s2">the gatekeeper and the like the sensing</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.570" end="00:55:49.870" style="s2">at the peripheries and you didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.150" end="00:55:52.150" style="s2">go well let&#39;s go let&#39;s go deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.870" end="00:55:53.650" style="s2">the science and deny all of that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.150" end="00:55:56.110" style="s2">actually wanted to bring them together</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.650" end="00:55:59.830" style="s2">you wanted to bring them into into</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.110" end="00:56:02.020" style="s2">conversation so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.830" end="00:56:04.090" style="s2">in which what I&#39;m hearing is is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.020" end="00:56:07.150" style="s2">internalization of like know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.090" end="00:56:08.740" style="s2">reality here what&#39;s actually factual but</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.150" end="00:56:11.620" style="s2">there&#39;s also you&#39;re also saying that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.740" end="00:56:13.240" style="s2">it&#39;s also factual right or it may be</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.620" end="00:56:16.540" style="s2">factual that there&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.240" end="00:56:19.710" style="s2">reality that you can&#39;t look at in terms</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.540" end="00:56:22.540" style="s2">of facts in the same way and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.710" end="00:56:25.540" style="s2">right it&#39;ll become pathology like it</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.540" end="00:56:27.340" style="s2">will become pathology there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.540" end="00:56:29.470" style="s2">a way in which there&#39;s a there&#39;s a like</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.340" end="00:56:33.060" style="s2">a true align that I&#39;m hearing through</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.190" end="00:56:49.529" style="s2">you&#39;re really conscious of this you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.759" end="00:56:50.999" style="s2">what you know what it&#39;s like to be in</p>

<p begin="00:56:50.999" end="00:56:56.910" style="s2">sensibilities right and you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.599" end="00:56:58.380" style="s2">conscious of how it&#39;s working just as</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.630" end="00:57:13.049" style="s2">shift an example of shift and noticing</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:14.339" style="s2">the shift right so it&#39;s as I just see</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.049" end="00:57:17.480" style="s2">you as somebody just really on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.339" end="00:57:20.309" style="s2">periphery of something self-conscious of</p>

<p begin="00:57:20.309" end="00:57:26.730" style="s2">growing personally like I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.710" end="00:57:28.740" style="s2">well first of all how does that sound</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.730" end="00:57:30.359" style="s2">that&#39;s my that&#39;s my recap of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.740" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">what I&#39;m basically hearing is if there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.430" end="00:57:44.570" style="s2">what is something what so there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.770" end="00:57:47.500" style="s2">worlds that disclose that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.570" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">disclosed just through facts right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.500" end="00:57:52.430" style="s2">and that we need to open up these two</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:53.960" style="s2">worlds and have them comfort like in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.430" end="00:57:56.570" style="s2">conversations in it and I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.960" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">aware of the dangers of any of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.570" end="00:58:02.090" style="s2">stuff becoming a kind of an ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:05.120" style="s2">that people just believe right um and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.090" end="00:58:15.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a sweet spot there yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.120" end="00:58:17.990" style="s2">kind of tendency to impress themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.740" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">upon you and whatever happens I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.990" end="00:58:25.310" style="s2">keep coming back to Ken Wilbur&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:29.930" style="s2">of sort of the four quadrants of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.310" end="00:58:31.820" style="s2">knowledge most I think I think he was</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.930" end="00:58:41.870" style="s2">essentially right in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.820" end="00:58:44.870" style="s2">particulars of his morals and so in in</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.870" end="00:58:48.170" style="s2">that in that sense than fact really only</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.870" end="00:58:50.150" style="s2">well they they occupy two two quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.170" end="00:58:52.910" style="s2">but they&#39;re not the whole thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.150" end="00:58:55.310" style="s2">think that&#39;s really it&#39;s a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.910" end="00:58:57.590" style="s2">model to make sense of the world and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.310" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">understand that there are yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.590" end="00:59:00.650" style="s2">certain things about reality that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:08.150" style="s2">irreducible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.650" end="00:59:10.820" style="s2">and yet we built a world on very few of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.150" end="00:59:17.620" style="s2">the yeah we built a world that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.820" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">emphasizes the material and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.620" end="00:59:25.310" style="s2">quantifiable and that&#39;s yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.470" end="00:59:26.870" style="s2">enough yeah totally it&#39;s not enough and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.310" end="00:59:28.490" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re actually really grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.870" end="00:59:29.690" style="s2">those things and you&#39;ve been bringing</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.490" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">those worlds together</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.690" end="00:59:35.750" style="s2">right yeah and slightly and wait what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:39.590" style="s2">your pet like when you just look at you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.750" end="00:59:43.220" style="s2">right like you yourself and being a</p>

<p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:48.710" style="s2">because there&#39;s that sense of like you</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.490" end="00:59:58.140" style="s2">an eye that arises with your audience</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:01.020" style="s2">right there&#39;s I though I&#39;m a different</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.100" end="01:00:51.410" style="s2">intimate conversation with yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.930" end="01:00:55.700" style="s2">your world in a way like I&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.410" end="01:00:59.960" style="s2">single focused and busy over the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.700" end="01:01:05.580" style="s2">two years of doing the wisdom I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.960" end="01:01:08.220" style="s2">really have that much yeah I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.580" end="01:01:09.690" style="s2">in many ways my world is kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.220" end="01:01:12.380" style="s2">certainly expanded in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.690" end="01:01:15.180" style="s2">people that I&#39;m talking to and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.380" end="01:01:19.820" style="s2">conversations I&#39;m having mostly online</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.180" end="01:01:19.820" style="s2">but yeah not so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.570" end="01:01:25.550" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t feel like I had time to</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.830" end="01:01:27.869" style="s2">sort of stop and feeling to whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.550" end="01:01:30.600" style="s2">things are fundamentally shifting in</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.869" end="01:01:33.960" style="s2">terms of who I am I mean I guess I feel</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.600" end="01:01:42.150" style="s2">more more sort of confident and aligned</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.960" end="01:01:44.790" style="s2">in my purpose and my answers yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.150" end="01:01:46.770" style="s2">direction and that does feel like a sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.790" end="01:01:50.010" style="s2">of very physical thing this was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.770" end="01:01:52.109" style="s2">visceral thing yeah yeah I noticed these</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.010" end="01:01:55.050" style="s2">cities you sat back to answer that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.109" end="01:01:58.260" style="s2">question I appreciated that hmm yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.050" end="01:01:59.990" style="s2">like when he said when he said yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.260" end="01:02:04.410" style="s2">actually haven&#39;t had much time to even</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.990" end="01:02:05.360" style="s2">kind of sit back and check that out but</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.410" end="01:02:06.620" style="s2">like when you just do</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.360" end="01:02:09.860" style="s2">when you just do I would just imagine</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.620" end="01:02:11.990" style="s2">like on I think the thing I wanted just</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.860" end="01:02:15.350" style="s2">to acknowledge is is just the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.990" end="01:02:20.350" style="s2">intelligibility that has been on a pulse</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.350" end="01:02:22.790" style="s2">and it has been deeply absorbed in and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.350" end="01:02:25.190" style="s2">adjusting and responding to something</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.790" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">that&#39;s been really what I&#39;m hearing is</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.190" end="01:02:30.260" style="s2">true and true for you probably for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">long time right mm-hmm and so I really</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.260" end="01:02:33.260" style="s2">appreciate I just appreciate that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:35.710" style="s2">appreciate all the adjustments that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.260" end="01:02:39.530" style="s2">you&#39;re making but I also really do think</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.710" end="01:02:44.540" style="s2">my sense is you do occupy a very rare</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.530" end="01:02:48.500" style="s2">position right in in that you are you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.540" end="01:02:50.210" style="s2">are of both worlds right while being</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.500" end="01:02:51.890" style="s2">interested in what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.210" end="01:02:54.140" style="s2">having a meadow awareness of like</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.890" end="01:02:56.120" style="s2">there&#39;s some shift happening and you are</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.140" end="01:02:58.760" style="s2">the one who is the one who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.120" end="01:03:00.200" style="s2">shifting and having that conversation I</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.760" end="01:03:02.840" style="s2">just noticed in my conversation with you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.200" end="01:03:04.550" style="s2">I like I wanna I want to get though I</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.680" end="01:03:14.090" style="s2">position and I appreciate that about you</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.030" end="01:03:16.450" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s right I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.770" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">no and I knew putting that out would</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.100" end="01:03:59.180" style="s2">create that reaction yeah I was mindful</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.870" end="01:09:15.900" style="s2">conversation that needs to happen like</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.200" end="01:09:17.220" style="s2">we are in touch with people who want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.900" end="01:09:19.800" style="s2">bring some of the stuff that we&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:09:19.800" end="01:09:25.950" style="s2">think this is the kind of time for like</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.460" end="01:09:31.290" style="s2">the deeper systemic thinking and the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.950" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">idea of paradigm shift like people are</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.290" end="01:09:35.430" style="s2">willing to have those kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:37.010" style="s2">conversations while it&#39;s most clear that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.430" end="01:09:42.030" style="s2">a lot of the old ways of breaking down</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.010" end="01:09:43.740" style="s2">so that is a sense of theirs that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.030" end="01:09:45.780" style="s2">ongoing conversation like how do we</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.010" end="01:10:02.699" style="s2">where you came from a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.600" end="01:10:04.199" style="s2">you probably really looked up to and had</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.699" end="01:10:07.350" style="s2">deep relationships with at least</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.199" end="01:10:08.670" style="s2">professionally you&#39;re out here and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.350" end="01:10:12.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether or not they actually</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.300" end="01:10:16.920" style="s2">valid right and in just the reckoning</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.730" end="01:10:19.440" style="s2">the reckoning of that the reckoning of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.920" end="01:10:21.810" style="s2">that I would imagine it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.440" end="01:10:24.120" style="s2">little bit I wish I were you anyways I</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.810" end="01:10:27.420" style="s2">would I would personally be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.120" end="01:10:31.260" style="s2">confronted to go back and ask them right</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.420" end="01:10:34.020" style="s2">cuz cuz that&#39;s on some level if I looked</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.260" end="01:10:37.590" style="s2">up to them right like I wouldn&#39;t want I</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.020" end="01:10:39.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I do willing to but it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.590" end="01:10:41.100" style="s2">look real comfortable to open myself up</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.390" end="01:10:45.920" style="s2">to my own self doubt that would be</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.100" end="01:10:45.920" style="s2">triggered in all of that you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.570" end="01:10:53.969" style="s2">this is a sense of you know people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.510" end="01:10:57.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve respected and also people with</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.969" end="01:11:01.560" style="s2">quite a kind of big public profile if</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.750" end="01:11:04.620" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of watching people like Jon</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.560" end="01:11:08.070" style="s2">Snow or Krishnan guru-murthy who British</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.620" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">people will know you know oh that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.070" end="01:11:12.020" style="s2">probably think that you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:12.020" style="s2">completely mental</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.680" end="01:11:18.630" style="s2">yes the only it&#39;s like a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.719" end="01:11:20.400" style="s2">aligned is syncing to so I just I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.630" end="01:11:23.420" style="s2">I think what I&#39;m actually realizing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:27.530" style="s2">like one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.420" end="01:11:29.300" style="s2">I know that for me in my own way since I</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.530" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">started doing these conversations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.300" end="01:11:34.160" style="s2">kind of taken off a life of its own but</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:38.210" style="s2">there really is a particular quality of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.160" end="01:11:40.120" style="s2">vulnerability that comes with this like</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.210" end="01:11:42.830" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to describe and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.120" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just that have knowing that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.830" end="01:11:47.540" style="s2">people who are watching you that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:50.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have a relationship with that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.540" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">informed by you in ways that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.270" end="01:11:56.989" style="s2">quite totally know about right and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:12:00.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just been strange too it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.989" end="01:12:02.510" style="s2">strange vulnerability to meet people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.679" end="01:12:04.460" style="s2">know a lot about you that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.510" end="01:12:07.340" style="s2">anything about them that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.460" end="01:12:11.060" style="s2">weird that&#39;s a strange no it strikes me</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.340" end="01:12:14.179" style="s2">as a so we&#39;re done where it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.060" end="01:12:15.670" style="s2">dynamic right but there is a I do feel</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.179" end="01:12:22.040" style="s2">the sense of that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.670" end="01:12:23.960" style="s2">responsibility there as well right to</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.040" end="01:12:25.790" style="s2">understand where they&#39;re coming from and</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.960" end="01:12:30.350" style="s2">like listen to them and like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.790" end="01:12:32.030" style="s2">there&#39;s um here I can I can really sit</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.350" end="01:12:33.890" style="s2">can really kind of get that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.030" end="01:12:37.820" style="s2">that that like oh yeah I am</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.890" end="01:12:40.820" style="s2">on some level my identity isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.820" end="01:12:43.670" style="s2">over here it&#39;s a conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.820" end="01:12:45.920" style="s2">happening with right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a back</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.670" end="01:12:47.270" style="s2">and forth because I know that for me and</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:48.530" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a lot of people you</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.270" end="01:12:51.800" style="s2">could probably relate to this as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.530" end="01:12:53.989" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know you start following</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.800" end="01:12:56.420" style="s2">people online right over a period of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.989" end="01:12:58.100" style="s2">time and you kind of walk around with</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.420" end="01:13:00.949" style="s2">them right you think about what they</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.100" end="01:13:02.330" style="s2">were saying like you whole arguments and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.949" end="01:13:03.770" style="s2">tensions that they&#39;re holding and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.330" end="01:13:06.350" style="s2">you see the world through those things</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.770" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">and then you watch the next video and</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.350" end="01:13:12.410" style="s2">the next conversation and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:14.480" style="s2">they start to become guests in your</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.410" end="01:13:16.699" style="s2">psyche if you will that become really</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.480" end="01:13:19.880" style="s2">really integrated right so to be one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.699" end="01:13:21.890" style="s2">those people on some level or to be in</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.880" end="01:13:25.070" style="s2">your case in a lot of case providing</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.890" end="01:13:27.770" style="s2">access to those people on some level you</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.070" end="01:13:29.630" style="s2">you know we we are being hosted you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.770" end="01:13:31.699" style="s2">in people&#39;s nervous systems and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.630" end="01:13:35.030" style="s2">levels that that they&#39;re not even aware</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.699" end="01:13:37.130" style="s2">of so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.030" end="01:13:40.670" style="s2">just an it&#39;s an unusual position to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.130" end="01:13:43.219" style="s2">in and there is a vulnerability to it</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.670" end="01:13:45.530" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s like for you to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.219" end="01:13:47.989" style="s2">there&#39;s even more of one because you</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.530" end="01:13:51.380" style="s2">come from you come from a background</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.989" end="01:13:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s in many ways you&#39;re like</p>
