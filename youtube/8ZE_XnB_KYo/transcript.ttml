<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">sitting on the fence between</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">uh anxiety which is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">oh god uh this is new this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">the first time i&#39;m trying a thing and</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">but it won&#39;t be as good as i want it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">be and i don&#39;t like that part of the</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">it makes me feel small and silly um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s only one side of the fence</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">the other side is like uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">enthusiasm and excitement and the um</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">embodied experience of that is confusing</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">whether i&#39;m anxious or excited so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">like trying to convince myself that no</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just excitement and this is going</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">to be great</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s me a bit giddy and happy to</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">when we&#39;re asking people to be sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">things so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna try and and do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">the the smallest version of the lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">lecture that i have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">summoning in my head for the last few</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">days of like all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">and just give the like uh essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">pieces of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">and what i&#39;d like us to do is basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">a bit of setup and then some practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be one practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">your own private reflection so i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">to bring you some questions and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">going to think about them</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">um and take notes get a notebook or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">write on the computer whatever just have</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">your own private process</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">and then the second part will be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">opportunity for us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">practice having a conversation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">a conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">um hopefully has some polarities in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">has some tension has some like</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">um energy and enthusiasm in it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">could get difficult and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">practice like how do we hold that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">tension in a generative way</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try to do and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the kind of thing where</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">you can hang back and it&#39;s you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">going to be pressured to participate</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be fine</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">so um the the kind of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">uh con the the content that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">put into the room to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">shared starting point</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">um ronan mentioned alter ego it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">network of social change people</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">political people</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:23.039" style="s2">and we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to become better versions</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.039" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">of ourselves so that we do a better kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">of social change</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">i guess like how do we grow up how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">support each other to grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">and be more mature and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">make better generative happier more</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">change and one of the dynamics that gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">in the way of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">is um how we show up in groups and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s my real</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">um curiosity is like how how does this</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">person called me show up when i&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">group and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">social reflex do i reflexes do i have</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">like how do those reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">change my behavior and and can i become</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">more aware of them and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">maybe show up in a more mature way</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">so the conceptual piece that really blew</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">my mind actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">came from peter so i&#39;m going to start</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">we&#39;ll share this if you haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">this white paper by peter and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">conor barnes i i recommend this</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">every couple of weeks to a new person</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">the memetic tribes of culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">and it&#39;s a long read and it&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">it it&#39;s from 2018</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">and um two years on it&#39;s still got a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">material in there that um both ronan and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">feel very resourced by and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">informing like how do we do the work</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">that we do in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">and i&#39;m not going to try and summarize</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">the 38 minute read but</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a piece in the middle which i</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">want to look into with some depth which</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">this table beautiful spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">and anyone who knows me knows that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">spreadsheet&#39;s in my happy place</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">so what this table is attempting to to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">is what peter calls memetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">so down the left left-hand side we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">this list of different tribes</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:08.560" style="s2">um and then across each row we have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">properties about these tribes so</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.560" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">this map is not attempting to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">accurate or</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">comprehensive but just to give a name to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">some of the different groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">currently active online</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">um like the social justice activists who</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">i for instance identify with</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">and what are we doing we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">end oppression and what are our values</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">and where do we meet</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">um what kind of identities do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">when i saw this list um this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">non-complete list of all these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">tribes it was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">um yeah like going from a view of oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s this planet called earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">to realizing there&#39;s this whole universe</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">or potentially a multiverse</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">of tons of different solar systems and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">like each one of these rows</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">has thousands of well potentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">millions of people some of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">they have a really comprehensive sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">of purpose and mission in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">they prioritize a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">values they have different meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">places different</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">sources of media that they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">attention to different heroes</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">they&#39;ve got really unique language you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">know the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">um describe themselves and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">they make sense of the world is quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">unique and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">um the languages</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">that maybe they&#39;re all speaking english</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">but in a way where it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">even to have a shared understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about and and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">this is the context in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">organizing this is the context in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">like we&#39;re pulling together these social</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">change activists who are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">the world better</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">pay attention to the tribe that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">the the tendencies that we have towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">a really toxic kind of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s really a huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">focus of mine in general so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">we have options i think like</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">when we&#39;re in when we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">positioned somewhere on this table or</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure none of us will feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">oh yes this totally gets me you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">me i&#39;m perfectly i&#39;m one of these new</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">atheists you&#39;ve got me here but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">um this idea that we are in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">in-group i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">we have an option we have a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">about which posture how do we occupy</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">so on the one option we have a what i</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">call ideological micronationalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">so this is um this is the worst side</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">of our in-group and out-group dynamic so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">this is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">um our beliefs are the right beliefs we</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">understand what&#39;s happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">and we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">um therefore</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">our people are unique and superior and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">therefore you know you should listen to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">uh we should be kind of in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">leading the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">all the other people and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">really like we should be in a fight with</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">um either either because we want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">conquer them or we&#39;re going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">convert them</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">and if if they really knew um how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">world works they&#39;d understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">were right all along</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like the worst posture</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">i think that we can take and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">trying to do with alterigo and with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">process that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">going to play with today is find a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">different posture which is not like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">nationalist posture but something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">more pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been playing with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">complicated majorities</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s a phrase that i picked up</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">from some activists in barcelona i also</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">saw it repeated in</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">taiwan as well and it&#39;s this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">we&#39;re heading into a future</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">that is going to be drastically</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">different and it&#39;s either going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">drastically different because</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve run out of energy and um the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">nation state has disintegrated</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">or it&#39;s going to be different because</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve figured out how to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">thriving and just and equitable and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">sustainable society either way it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">we&#39;re undergoing a lot of change and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">we&#39;d like that change to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">done democratically and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">need a complicated majority to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">it that means we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">need to be able to step outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">little row on the table</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">instead of just being us you know like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">our crew is mostly a bit of here</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">a bit of here some of this i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">occupier so that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">instead of me and my crew kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">over the world we actually have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">build complicated majorities with some</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">of the others</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">so how do we do that i mean this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">big puzzle and we don&#39;t know but this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">been invited to work it out with us i</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">a big part of it has got to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">curiosity so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">being curious about what we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">rather than being so attached to what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">do know and how we&#39;re so certain about</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">how the world&#39;s going and our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">are the right ones we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">cultivating intentionally our curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">about the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">and that curiosity extends to other</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">people not that we don&#39;t assume that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">they are stupid and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">and just needing to be converted we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">assume that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">have had distinct experiences which have</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">led to them having different values and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">beliefs and maybe a posture of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">could open up</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">a genuine relationship maybe i could</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">learn something maybe we would change</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">each other&#39;s mind if we allowed each</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">other to really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">open up to a genuine conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of internal curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">that happens as well which is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">paying attention to our own motivations</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">and emotions in our social reflexes like</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">what is it that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">am i purely being driven because i want</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">to see a socially just world or is there</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">also some of my own stuff around</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">belonging</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">and um my psychology and my emotions</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">also playing out in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">in that process so we want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">like unpick some of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">i really don&#39;t like presenting to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">screen it&#39;s much nicer to stop sharing</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">and now see all your faces again</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">so i want to get into a practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">because this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">like i can i can practice um i can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">the tell but what we need is the show i</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">reckon</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">and and and to learn how do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">so there&#39;s the first phase which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">going to be an invitation for you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">write some notes for yourself in silence</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">um i&#39;ve got some questions to get that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">ball rolling</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">ronan if you feel like um we need to add</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">extra questions or prompts please just</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">jump in and do it but just just to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">the ball rolling</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">what i want you to be thinking about is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">in-groups or the tribes or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">collective identities that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">currently affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">like when you looked at that list where</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something like yeah i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">there so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">i&#39;m definitely this or i&#39;m kind of a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">and can you think about what are some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">doubts or like other thoughts that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">would withhold from those groups because</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">of the risk of being judged or</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">ostracized or you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m part of that collective but i</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want them to know this about me</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">so i think we start there and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">add you some more prompts</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">um maybe it&#39;s just helpful as a prompt</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">and</p>
