<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:54.230" style="s2">actually in this case we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:57.539" style="s2">talking about is there communicating</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.230" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">extraterrestrial intelligence Chris and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.539" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">his co-author damn I don&#39;t have your</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">co-authors name in front of me why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">you tell me your co-authors name the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">co-author was Tom Westby and he is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">first author and he&#39;s the one who took</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">really the the lead in writing the paper</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">and doing the analysis I was more of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">supervisor he&#39;s a master student who</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">works in engineering at the University</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">of Nottingham and in mathematics he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">like a kind of like a lecturer type</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">position there where he does quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">of teaching and he was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">doing a project in astronomy with me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">on this this project on</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">asking about how many communicating</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:44.580" style="s2">intelligent civilizations they are is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:47.190" style="s2">not really something that let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.580" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">mainstream astronomy it would some time</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.190" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">to prove up or do and so someone who</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:56.220" style="s2">wanted to do like a terminal degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">a masters would be the best person to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.220" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">this kind of project because he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">interested in having a full-time career</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">as an astronomer and I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">established so they can&#39;t get rid of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">so easily I love it&#39;s kind of like in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">cognitive science speculation about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">consciousness has that same attribute</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">you better wait till you get your Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:18.030" style="s2">Prize or at least till you&#39;re a tenured</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">professor to ever to say the c-word or</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.030" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll be in big trouble alright</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">fortunately that&#39;s starting to break</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">down I hope SETI becomes a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">more legitimate field and what we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">Jill tarter on the show back in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:31.380" style="s2">September and of course she spent her</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">whole life fighting against the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.380" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">prejudiced against both females her</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">honors and SETI and has done done lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">of very interesting work that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.750" end="00:02:44.549" style="s2">anyway the paper we&#39;re gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">today was recently published by Chris</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.549" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">and his co-authors called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">astrobiological Copernican weak and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:52.459" style="s2">strong limits for intelligent life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">published in the Astrophysical Journal</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.459" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">but for most of us getting it off the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:59.940" style="s2">archive server is just fine a pre-press</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:01.950" style="s2">version a little ugly but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.940" end="00:03:03.570" style="s2">definitely readable then as always we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.950" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">post a link to that article on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.570" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">episode page at Jim ratio calm again as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">listeners to the show now I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">absolutely fascinated with this question</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">about extraterrestrial life in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">own personal hierarchy of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">questions I ranked it number 2 people</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">say well what&#39;s your number one and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">number one is why is there something and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:31.380" style="s2">not nothing you know why does the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:33.900" style="s2">universe even exist and like SETI that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.380" end="00:03:35.970" style="s2">considered a somewhat out-of-bounds</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.900" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">question in some of the more established</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.970" end="00:03:39.510" style="s2">fields of science that&#39;s alright but</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">number two is are we alone</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.510" end="00:03:44.730" style="s2">has so many huge implications about you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.470" style="s2">know what is the purpose of humans on</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">earth you know what is our destiny</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.470" end="00:03:50.600" style="s2">what&#39;s the destiny of the universe just</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:51.980" style="s2">gigantic question</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.600" end="00:03:55.030" style="s2">and this is a question people have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.980" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">speculating about for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.030" end="00:03:58.610" style="s2">Chris and team have done something which</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">is very interesting which is they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.610" end="00:04:02.660" style="s2">taken the old Drake Equation and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:04.970" style="s2">updated it with a lot of the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.660" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">findings and science we&#39;re gonna go over</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.970" end="00:04:10.610" style="s2">here a little bit and they&#39;ve used a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:11.990" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ll argue with them a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.610" end="00:04:14.060" style="s2">little bit about the the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.990" end="00:04:17.570" style="s2">appropriateness of it but this weak and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.060" end="00:04:19.880" style="s2">strong Copernican principle and then and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.570" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">it yields some you know specific numbers</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.880" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">on how many what&#39;s the range of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:28.550" style="s2">number of communicating civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.400" end="00:04:30.230" style="s2">within our galaxy so with that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.550" end="00:04:32.480" style="s2">turn it over to Chris to may be frame a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.230" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">little bit about the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.480" end="00:04:38.900" style="s2">Drake Equation you know and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">insights on new scientific discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:44.480" style="s2">that have allowed you to restate it in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:48.610" style="s2">in a different perhaps more tractable</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.480" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">fashion sure thanks very much right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.610" end="00:04:53.180" style="s2">essentially the way to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">problem is really to in some ways take</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.180" end="00:04:57.950" style="s2">it from a historical perspective so for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:01.700" style="s2">many thousands of years people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.950" end="00:05:03.380" style="s2">wondered about life on other planets and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.700" end="00:05:06.110" style="s2">other places within our galaxy within</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.380" end="00:05:08.510" style="s2">the universe and they have actively</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.110" end="00:05:10.430" style="s2">speculated on this for as long as really</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.510" end="00:05:11.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to write so we know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.430" end="00:05:14.030" style="s2">ancient Greeks thought about this and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.750" end="00:05:15.790" style="s2">know that throughout time since then</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.030" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">that it&#39;s also been a major question</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.790" end="00:05:21.050" style="s2">people were burned at the stake for for</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:23.660" style="s2">suggesting it and it&#39;s been highly</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.050" end="00:05:24.980" style="s2">controversial throughout time and simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.660" end="00:05:26.750" style="s2">because we just don&#39;t know and we still</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.980" end="00:05:29.030" style="s2">don&#39;t know we don&#39;t have an answer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:30.920" style="s2">my paper doesn&#39;t tell us an answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.030" end="00:05:33.080" style="s2">either it just gives us some benchmark</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.920" end="00:05:35.200" style="s2">for how to measure measure this question</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.080" end="00:05:39.350" style="s2">and what the potential answer might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.200" end="00:05:42.830" style="s2">within a few assumptions so with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.350" end="00:05:46.730" style="s2">for let&#39;s say a couple hundred years or</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.830" end="00:05:48.710" style="s2">so in the past from now the astronomers</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.730" end="00:05:51.740" style="s2">that thought about this question we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.710" end="00:05:54.620" style="s2">quite bullish on the idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.740" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">life throughout even the solar system so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.620" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">for example strana murders like William</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:01.040" style="s2">Herschel and his son John Herschel two</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.970" end="00:06:03.560" style="s2">of the most distinguished astronomers at</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.560" end="00:06:07.580" style="s2">believed that</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.580" end="00:06:11.450" style="s2">Sun and the moon were inhabited that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:13.130" style="s2">there was life throughout our solar</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.450" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">system and in fact of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.130" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">Percival Lowell and the canals on Mars</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:20.150" style="s2">which was a huge topic at the turn of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">the 20th century with many many</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.150" end="00:06:23.330" style="s2">astronomers believing this of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">there were doubts in that time but</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.330" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">throughout the 20th century as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">learned more and more about the solar</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:32.270" style="s2">system we have realized that life at</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">least intelligent life certainly doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.270" end="00:06:36.830" style="s2">really or cannot exist let&#39;s say within</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.210" end="00:06:38.930" style="s2">our solar system that we are really the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.830" end="00:06:40.340" style="s2">only intelligent species within our</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">solar system it would be hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.340" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">that they could be so well hidden that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:45.980" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t have seen anything by now</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:48.320" style="s2">and that of course happened when you had</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.980" end="00:06:51.410" style="s2">the space probes going to to Mars</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.320" end="00:06:52.940" style="s2">landing on Mars Venus and so on and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.410" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">know that there&#39;s no you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.940" end="00:06:56.390" style="s2">civilizations living on Mars building</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:58.760" style="s2">canals that&#39;s certainly not true and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.390" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">there is a need even even evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.760" end="00:07:04.100" style="s2">any kind of past life on Mars that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">convincing I would think so far so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.100" end="00:07:09.140" style="s2">up there just with one little pushback</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">which is you know there is some thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.140" end="00:07:12.290" style="s2">that they&#39;re you know that there could</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:14.390" style="s2">be life maybe even intelligent life</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.290" end="00:07:16.610" style="s2">though probably not communicating at</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.390" end="00:07:19.150" style="s2">least well I don&#39;t know about that on</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.610" end="00:07:21.800" style="s2">some of the couple of the icy moons</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.150" end="00:07:24.200" style="s2">Europa what&#39;s the other one around</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.800" end="00:07:25.880" style="s2">Saturn but anyway there&#39;s two of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.200" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">that&#39;s thought that we&#39;ll have water</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.880" end="00:07:31.400" style="s2">oceans well under the surface that could</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">be liquid water and we&#39;ll have rocky</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.400" end="00:07:36.110" style="s2">bottoms so they&#39;ll provide the metallic</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:37.610" style="s2">ions that are necessary for our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.110" end="00:07:39.350" style="s2">life yeah we could have something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.610" end="00:07:42.050" style="s2">octopuses or something like that down</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.350" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">there and who knows once you know how</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.050" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">far what they might have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">develop so I wouldn&#39;t quite rule it out</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:50.570" style="s2">in the solar system yet it is to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:52.880" style="s2">one of the very key questions that will</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.570" end="00:07:55.820" style="s2">actually help get some traction on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.880" end="00:08:01.190" style="s2">part of the Drake Equation that you more</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.820" end="00:08:02.750" style="s2">or less punted on which is is life does</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.190" end="00:08:06.230" style="s2">it happen all the time does it happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.750" end="00:08:09.620" style="s2">never almost never you know fairly often</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.230" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">but a random roll of dice and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.620" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">looking at those undersea environments</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:15.640" style="s2">may provide us a big clue on that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:18.210" style="s2">anyway continue sorry for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.640" end="00:08:21.690" style="s2">interruption no no no please</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.210" end="00:08:25.560" style="s2">Center up much as you like yeah so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.690" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">you said is is true what what I perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.560" end="00:08:29.069" style="s2">should have said in a clearer way is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.949" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t a intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.069" end="00:08:33.930" style="s2">communicating life within the solar</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.949" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">system that we would have detected that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.930" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">unless the way they communicate is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:39.149" style="s2">different from the way that we do and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:41.219" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to imagine how that might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.149" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">so what I mean by that is there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.219" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">like these octopi or not you know they</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:49.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have like under underwater cities</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">that have that emit light or have radio</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">waves or something because we would have</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:53.490" style="s2">detected that by now so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:55.529" style="s2">what I really meant by that so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.490" end="00:08:57.089" style="s2">absolutely right that these moons could</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.529" end="00:08:59.640" style="s2">indeed have some form of life in them</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.089" end="00:09:01.770" style="s2">and I certainly would not want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.640" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">discourage people from thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.770" end="00:09:06.149" style="s2">that considering that or and searching</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:08.700" style="s2">for it and having missions to go look</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.149" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">for it I think all that&#39;s very good and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.700" end="00:09:12.120" style="s2">should be done but I do think that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:13.890" style="s2">it would be hard to imagine that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.120" end="00:09:16.440" style="s2">would be intelligent communicating life</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.890" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">on on those moons but hey if I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.440" end="00:09:23.550" style="s2">that would be fantastic right that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:25.020" style="s2">great okay so that&#39;s really the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.550" end="00:09:29.310" style="s2">of the history up into the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.020" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">for this idea of looking for let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.310" end="00:09:34.140" style="s2">life went on other parts of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.500" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">and it&#39;s always been something which has</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.140" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">been solar system focused people really</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:40.589" style="s2">want to know about it in the solar</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:42.300" style="s2">system people want to know and find out</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.589" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">life in the sources and it&#39;s really been</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.300" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">the focus for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:48.180" style="s2">personally I think that when we noticed</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">that life wasn&#39;t super common at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.180" end="00:09:52.380" style="s2">in the solar system that people got very</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">discouraged about this idea of there</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.380" end="00:09:56.100" style="s2">being any kind of life throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:58.230" style="s2">universe simply because we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.100" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">finding it in places where we once</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.230" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">thought it might exist of course SETI</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:03.749" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:05.100" style="s2">at about the same time and SETI&#39;s is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.749" end="00:10:07.439" style="s2">little bit different from looking for</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.100" end="00:10:10.499" style="s2">life in the solar system because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.439" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">traditional SETI looks for radio waves</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.499" end="00:10:14.670" style="s2">coming from other stars which may be</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">produced by an intelligence something</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.670" end="00:10:20.279" style="s2">which cannot be produced by a known</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:22.589" style="s2">Astrophysical object or process which</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">emits light in a way that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.589" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">you have to find a signal which looks</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:29.819" style="s2">artificial that is looks made by an</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:32.759" style="s2">elected by an intelligence and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.819" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">started in around 1960 and since then</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.759" end="00:10:37.980" style="s2">these the SETI surveys have gotten more</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:40.499" style="s2">sophisticated and bigger and you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.980" end="00:10:43.470" style="s2">various big projects going on now to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.499" end="00:10:47.129" style="s2">look for SETI in this way and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.470" end="00:10:48.749" style="s2">fantastic so the question that we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.129" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">to answer and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.749" end="00:10:53.369" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about for for a long</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:54.990" style="s2">time for almost well 10 years now is can</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.369" end="00:10:57.929" style="s2">we actually say something about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.990" end="00:11:00.629" style="s2">number of likely communicating</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.929" end="00:11:02.249" style="s2">intelligent civilizations that are in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.629" end="00:11:02.639" style="s2">the galaxy that we could detect right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.249" end="00:11:05.069" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.639" end="00:11:07.079" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot to pick apart with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.069" end="00:11:08.999" style="s2">that statement so you have to have life</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.079" end="00:11:10.499" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the first thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.999" end="00:11:12.179" style="s2">you have to also have intelligent life</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.499" end="00:11:13.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the second thing but then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.179" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">also have to have communicating</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.740" end="00:11:18.420" style="s2">intelligent life so you have to have all</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:20.819" style="s2">three of those for this calculation to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.420" end="00:11:23.069" style="s2">work okay so if you have intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.819" end="00:11:26.069" style="s2">life so we&#39;ve had intelligent life on on</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.069" end="00:11:28.589" style="s2">earth for for a very long time for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.069" end="00:11:31.379" style="s2">know maybe a hundred thousand years or</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.589" end="00:11:33.089" style="s2">so maybe more than that and we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.379" end="00:11:34.769" style="s2">communicating intelligent life for only</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.089" end="00:11:37.620" style="s2">about a hundred years that is that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.769" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2">long we on earth as humans have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.620" end="00:11:44.189" style="s2">artificially producing signals from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:46.889" style="s2">earth which got into space okay and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.189" end="00:11:50.759" style="s2">can think of this as radar as radio</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.889" end="00:11:53.850" style="s2">waves from radio from television from</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.759" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">satellites or even lights that come from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.850" end="00:11:58.740" style="s2">cities so those are artificial</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:00.360" style="s2">reproductions of artificial light which</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.740" end="00:12:03.420" style="s2">is not produced by an Astrophysical</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.360" end="00:12:06.059" style="s2">process is produced by an intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.420" end="00:12:08.100" style="s2">the communicating intelligence so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.059" end="00:12:09.660" style="s2">what we mean by that and so we know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.100" end="00:12:11.980" style="s2">that&#39;s existed on earth for about a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.660" end="00:12:13.240" style="s2">hundred years okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.980" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">now the other thing which happened in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.240" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">the last decade is that we&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:22.210" style="s2">lot about about galaxies about star</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:24.100" style="s2">formation about planets where we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.210" end="00:12:29.190" style="s2">start really answering this question of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.100" end="00:12:31.180" style="s2">how many of the type of communicating</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.190" end="00:12:34.030" style="s2">extraterrestrial civilizations might</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.180" end="00:12:35.590" style="s2">there be throughout our galaxy and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.030" end="00:12:37.900" style="s2">way we approach this problem was very</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.590" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">simple we just said let&#39;s assume that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:43.030" style="s2">that life intelligent life and even a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:44.950" style="s2">communicating intelligent life is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.030" end="00:12:46.900" style="s2">natural process which happens in science</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.950" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">so this is a big question of course and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.900" end="00:12:51.250" style="s2">you know we could very well be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.000" end="00:12:54.370" style="s2">I completely admit this but we have no</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.250" end="00:12:56.020" style="s2">idea if it&#39;s right or wrong so I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:57.670" style="s2">argue it&#39;s important to make that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.020" end="00:12:59.710" style="s2">assumption and to look at what you find</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.670" end="00:13:01.750" style="s2">so the question is how many of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.710" end="00:13:04.090" style="s2">exists throughout our galaxy how many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.750" end="00:13:06.430" style="s2">these communicating extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.090" end="00:13:08.440" style="s2">civilizations are there so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.430" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">assume that they just form as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.440" end="00:13:13.150" style="s2">part of science for example if you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.890" style="s2">the right amount of gas at the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.150" end="00:13:17.310" style="s2">temperature and density you form a star</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.890" end="00:13:19.390" style="s2">or form a galaxy you form different</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.310" end="00:13:21.100" style="s2">things that you see in science are</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.390" end="00:13:23.170" style="s2">produced in a way which is predictable</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.100" end="00:13:25.390" style="s2">based on the initial conditions of of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.170" end="00:13:27.010" style="s2">how you start so why should life be any</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.390" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">different than that so this is really</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.010" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">the way that I like to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">and this is the assumption that we make</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:34.570" style="s2">in this calculation we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">this again about testing that assumption</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.570" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">when said he actually succeeds and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">say Maps the galaxies in terms of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">intelligent life within it ok so what do</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:46.540" style="s2">you need to know to do this calculation</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:49.090" style="s2">you need to know how many stars are as</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.540" end="00:13:51.550" style="s2">old as the Sun you need to know how many</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.090" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">of those stars can survive that long so</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.550" end="00:13:56.080" style="s2">the Sun is about about five billion</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:57.610" style="s2">years old how many other stars that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.080" end="00:13:58.900" style="s2">existing in our galaxy today are at</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">least that old and it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.900" end="00:14:03.220" style="s2">pretty high fraction it&#39;s in the 90s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:06.100" style="s2">percentage of stars that are in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.220" end="00:14:08.530" style="s2">galaxy today are potentially able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.100" end="00:14:09.940" style="s2">host life in terms of his age so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.530" end="00:14:13.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really just qualify very many</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.940" end="00:14:15.580" style="s2">stars then you have the idea of how many</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.060" end="00:14:16.960" style="s2">of these stars have planets and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.580" end="00:14:18.430" style="s2">something which has always been a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.960" end="00:14:21.430" style="s2">unknown and you mentioned this already</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.430" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">the Drake Equation is is how many stars</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.430" end="00:14:24.700" style="s2">have planets and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">we actually have some idea about now</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.700" end="00:14:28.829" style="s2">from the Kepler</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:31.740" style="s2">which is a satellite mission which which</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.829" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">observed a patch of sky to look for</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.740" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">planets around stars and was able to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:39.779" style="s2">there&#39;s about seventeen eighteen percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.779" end="00:14:42.269" style="s2">of stars have planets in the habitable</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.779" end="00:14:44.279" style="s2">zone in the habitable zone is that area</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.269" end="00:14:46.920" style="s2">around the star which is not too hot</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.279" end="00:14:49.889" style="s2">which is not too cold which is able and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.920" end="00:14:51.630" style="s2">principal to form life as we know it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.889" end="00:14:54.600" style="s2">earth that is the same temperature is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.630" end="00:14:57.389" style="s2">roughly the Sun at the at the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.600" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">the earth so with those two things you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.389" end="00:15:01.709" style="s2">now know how many stars there are you</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:03.569" style="s2">know how many planets there are around</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.709" end="00:15:05.069" style="s2">each Sun but at the same time another</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.569" end="00:15:08.069" style="s2">feature which was never part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.069" end="00:15:10.199" style="s2">original Drake Equation is answering the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:12.449" style="s2">question well how does the metallicity</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.199" end="00:15:14.459" style="s2">of the stars change throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.449" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">galaxy so the metallicity is really</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.459" end="00:15:19.170" style="s2">critical for this I think and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:21.240" style="s2">is well first of all let me explain what</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:23.579" style="s2">metallicity is so metallicity to an</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.240" end="00:15:25.980" style="s2">astronomer is any element which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.579" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">heavier than helium so that kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.980" end="00:15:30.930" style="s2">sometimes funny to people when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">teach this and in my classes and I tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.930" end="00:15:34.829" style="s2">students this they sometimes laugh</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:37.110" style="s2">because it sounds ridiculous and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.829" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">it did to me once too but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.110" end="00:15:40.220" style="s2">way his try numbers talk so metals are</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">anything heavier than helium in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.220" end="00:15:48.029" style="s2">periodic table so elements like he</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:49.529" style="s2">carbon oxygen nitrogen the big ones you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.029" end="00:15:52.230" style="s2">need for life are all what astronomers</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.529" end="00:15:53.819" style="s2">called metals and these all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.230" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">correlate together that is when you find</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.819" end="00:15:59.490" style="s2">a star that has a lot of carbon you also</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">find a lot of oxygen and nitrogen and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">on they go together because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:06.690" style="s2">formed in nucleosynthesis in in stars</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:09.089" style="s2">which then go supernova and go through</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.690" end="00:16:11.639" style="s2">stellar evolution which then reproduces</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.089" end="00:16:13.589" style="s2">these elements into the interstellar</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.639" end="00:16:16.290" style="s2">medium which then use for further star</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.589" end="00:16:19.019" style="s2">formation so they correlate together so</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.290" end="00:16:20.970" style="s2">what you need essentially getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.019" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">point of this is that you need a star</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.970" end="00:16:26.220" style="s2">that has a high metal content that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">has a loss of these elements to form</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.220" end="00:16:29.639" style="s2">life because you can&#39;t make life as far</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.110" end="00:16:31.769" style="s2">as we know it out of just hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.639" end="00:16:33.269" style="s2">helium doesn&#39;t exist and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.769" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">imagine how that could ever happen if</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.269" end="00:16:37.620" style="s2">you want things like amino acids these</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">kind of things you need to have these</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.620" end="00:16:39.630" style="s2">these elements that were heavier than</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:42.630" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.630" end="00:16:45.030" style="s2">so the places of in our galaxy where you</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.630" end="00:16:48.180" style="s2">have these these heavier elements are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.030" end="00:16:49.410" style="s2">more likely to form life and that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.180" end="00:16:52.200" style="s2">also something that&#39;s has only been</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.410" end="00:16:53.610" style="s2">known in the last 5 years or so and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.200" end="00:16:56.370" style="s2">we know how many stars have the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.610" end="00:16:59.610" style="s2">metal content by the way the Sun our own</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.370" end="00:17:01.140" style="s2">star is pretty metal rich compared to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.610" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">most stars on our galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.140" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">it is much richer than most most nearby</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:10.530" style="s2">stars at least in our own galaxy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">that may or may not have anything to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.530" end="00:17:14.069" style="s2">with the fact that we exist at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:15.780" style="s2">but I think it does I think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.069" end="00:17:17.130" style="s2">have these heavy elements and you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.780" end="00:17:20.339" style="s2">to have them in great abundance to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.130" end="00:17:22.500" style="s2">actually produce life ok so putting all</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.339" end="00:17:24.600" style="s2">that together you can then ask well how</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.500" end="00:17:27.750" style="s2">many of these stars have planet which</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.600" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">can host life potentially in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.750" end="00:17:31.910" style="s2">habitable zone how many of them have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">right metal content and when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.910" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">what you need to den calculate is how</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.620" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">long you think these intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:42.600" style="s2">communicating civilizations will last</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">and this is really one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.600" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2">aspects of this and one of the funnest</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.890" end="00:17:47.250" style="s2">parts of it and will hopefully hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">we can get into this in more detail but</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.250" end="00:17:52.530" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s how long do you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:54.050" style="s2">the civilizations will last this has</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.530" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">always been one of the big unknowns</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.050" end="00:17:59.640" style="s2">within the Drake Equation and the simple</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:01.620" style="s2">thing that we did was was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.640" end="00:18:04.170" style="s2">things we did was to just assume that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.620" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">the life which exists which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.170" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">communicating is similar to our own and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">we know that we&#39;ve been around for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:12.030" style="s2">hundred years sending out signals into</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.990" end="00:18:14.130" style="s2">space so we just ask the question well</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.030" end="00:18:16.410" style="s2">what if these other civilizations only</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.130" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">last 100 years and we know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.410" end="00:18:21.180" style="s2">lasted 100 we may go longer we may go</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:23.850" style="s2">hopefully go longer but you know we may</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.180" end="00:18:25.230" style="s2">go 200 years a million years we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.850" end="00:18:26.940" style="s2">know but we know we&#39;ve done a hundred so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.230" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">let&#39;s just see if we use a hundred as</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.940" end="00:18:31.230" style="s2">the typical average lifespan of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:33.900" style="s2">intelligent communicating civilization</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.230" end="00:18:35.730" style="s2">how many would you expect to find so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.900" end="00:18:38.850" style="s2">put all that together what we find is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.730" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">that you have on average about 36 and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.850" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">then if you look at the error range in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:45.540" style="s2">that which is important based on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">errors on these values you find that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.540" end="00:18:50.610" style="s2">error goes from a couple to up to about</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:52.500" style="s2">200 so that&#39;s really the range of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.610" end="00:18:53.490" style="s2">you would expect based on this</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.500" end="00:18:55.890" style="s2">assumption</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.490" end="00:18:58.429" style="s2">about how life forms within our galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.890" end="00:19:01.290" style="s2">if you think life forms in our galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.429" end="00:19:04.440" style="s2">around other stars in a similar way as</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.290" end="00:19:06.510" style="s2">it does on our own that is that life and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.440" end="00:19:11.820" style="s2">intelligent life is not outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.510" end="00:19:14.010" style="s2">let&#39;s say scientific process of forming</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.820" end="00:19:17.310" style="s2">structure and and and how science works</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.010" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">then this is really how many you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.310" end="00:19:22.800" style="s2">expect to see based on a lifespan which</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:25.650" style="s2">is similar to our own at the current age</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.800" end="00:19:27.480" style="s2">now if you want to believe that that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.650" end="00:19:29.250" style="s2">lifespan of an average civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.480" end="00:19:30.510" style="s2">much longer than a hundred years then</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.250" end="00:19:32.280" style="s2">you can usually use our formula and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.510" end="00:19:34.200" style="s2">calculate how many you would expect and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.280" end="00:19:36.060" style="s2">that number would go up but this is sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.200" end="00:19:39.570" style="s2">of a lower limit if you will based on</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.060" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">this assumption okay let me ask a couple</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.570" end="00:19:43.860" style="s2">of clarifying questions about one in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:46.790" style="s2">your paper you let you lay out two</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.860" end="00:19:49.920" style="s2">different models the weak and the strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.790" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">Copernican principle as I recall from</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.920" end="00:19:54.750" style="s2">the paper 36 is for the strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:56.760" style="s2">Copernican principle is that correct yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.750" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">and if you could maybe make the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:20:00.180" style="s2">distinction between the strong and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:02.970" style="s2">weak and provide people what the number</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.180" end="00:20:05.490" style="s2">might be for the weak principle Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.970" end="00:20:08.660" style="s2">right that&#39;s a great question so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.490" end="00:20:10.740" style="s2">strong principle is that life forms</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.660" end="00:20:13.350" style="s2">exactly the same way as it has on earth</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.740" end="00:20:15.540" style="s2">so that just means that essentially that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.350" end="00:20:16.950" style="s2">life will form around five billion years</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.540" end="00:20:19.560" style="s2">and the errorbar that we put on that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.950" end="00:20:22.110" style="s2">about a billion years so we allow life</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.560" end="00:20:24.630" style="s2">to form between 4.5 and 5.5 billion</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">years that is that that&#39;s when life will</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.630" end="00:20:28.380" style="s2">that elegent life that communicating</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:31.770" style="s2">intelligent life will appear within that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:33.660" style="s2">limited range of time the weak principle</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.770" end="00:20:35.670" style="s2">is that it takes five billion years at</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.660" end="00:20:38.130" style="s2">least to form a communicating</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.670" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">intelligent life so that life can</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.130" end="00:20:41.910" style="s2">conform at five billion years six</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:43.980" style="s2">billion years seven billion years all</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.910" end="00:20:45.960" style="s2">the way up to the age of the the start</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.980" end="00:20:49.050" style="s2">because obviously you can&#39;t have life</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.960" end="00:20:51.510" style="s2">forming in a star over a time period</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.050" end="00:20:53.190" style="s2">which is older than the stars age so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.510" end="00:20:55.500" style="s2">stars age is like upper limit to how</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.190" end="00:20:58.710" style="s2">long that life can form so that gives</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.500" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">you a lot more time for the life to form</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.710" end="00:21:03.330" style="s2">within the within the star and when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:07.430" style="s2">use that you find that there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.330" end="00:21:09.450" style="s2">thousand possible of these these these</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.430" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">communicating extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.450" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">intelligence telogen to outer galaxies</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">which we call Chetty with the sea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:18.750" style="s2">what we call them and so it&#39;s slightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.010" end="00:21:20.280" style="s2">different so depending on how you assume</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.750" end="00:21:22.740" style="s2">things will form that&#39;s what you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.280" end="00:21:25.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what you would find if you only</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.740" end="00:21:27.740" style="s2">use this five billion years or so as</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.610" end="00:21:29.570" style="s2">a lower limit for the amount of time it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.740" end="00:21:32.059" style="s2">takes for this communicating intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.570" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">civilization to form gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.059" end="00:21:38.780" style="s2">and just for the audience&#39;s sake the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:41.350" style="s2">median age of stars in the galaxies what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.780" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">about 10 billion years as I recall it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.350" end="00:21:45.740" style="s2">it&#39;s in our paper I&#39;m no I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">it wrong fortunately but it&#39;s it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.740" end="00:21:52.070" style="s2">it&#39;s around 9 my mercury actually you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:54.170" style="s2">have the median age as 10.35 about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.070" end="00:21:56.750" style="s2">10.35 ok sorry it sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.170" end="00:21:59.030" style="s2">off so it&#39;s it&#39;s about five gears yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.750" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2">the mean age is a bit lower Knapp though</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.030" end="00:22:02.929" style="s2">we know that a lot of there&#39;s that skew</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.040" end="00:22:05.179" style="s2">down at the low end for the giant stars</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.929" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">yeah so yeah the media it&#39;s about 10</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.179" end="00:22:08.540" style="s2">this call it&#39;s called 10 close enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:11.270" style="s2">another question I had that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.540" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">address is that I recall from the course</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.270" end="00:22:14.750" style="s2">in stellar evolution or actually as part</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:18.440" style="s2">of an astronomy of course I took it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.750" end="00:22:20.450" style="s2">was in college that the supernovas were</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.440" end="00:22:23.510" style="s2">much more common in the earlier days</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.450" end="00:22:27.380" style="s2">than today with that in any way change</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:30.340" style="s2">your analysis no we didn&#39;t consider that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.380" end="00:22:32.360" style="s2">and the reason we didn&#39;t is because</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.340" end="00:22:34.280" style="s2">supernovae certainly are more common</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.360" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">when you have more star formation events</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.280" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">and those will have occurred let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.500" style="s2">billions of years ago so the star</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:44.299" style="s2">formation in our galaxy peaked about 3</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.500" end="00:22:46.940" style="s2">or 4 billion years after the Big Bang</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.299" end="00:22:48.470" style="s2">and now we are almost 14 billion years</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.940" end="00:22:49.790" style="s2">after the Big Bang so there was a long</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.470" end="00:22:52.190" style="s2">time ago when the peak of star formation</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.790" end="00:22:54.230" style="s2">occurred and those supernovae would have</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.190" end="00:22:57.140" style="s2">happened within a couple hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.230" end="00:22:59.480" style="s2">years of this you know when the star</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.140" end="00:23:01.700" style="s2">formation happens so most supernovae and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.480" end="00:23:04.010" style="s2">our galaxy would have occurred much</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.700" end="00:23:05.900" style="s2">earlier in its history and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.010" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">be pretty close to a supernova for to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.900" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">really affect the life on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:13.640" style="s2">planet so it&#39;s probably not a major</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:15.650" style="s2">production or destruction of of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.640" end="00:23:19.940" style="s2">life-forms within our galaxy especially</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.650" end="00:23:21.950" style="s2">when we know the rate is about I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.940" end="00:23:24.169" style="s2">say it wrong but the rate is I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.950" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">only maybe a couple a century at most</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.169" end="00:23:27.110" style="s2">for these supernovae happening within</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">our own galaxy and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.110" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">necessarily the type which come about</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:34.160" style="s2">and star formation but are the the type</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.230" style="s2">one supernova which are thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.160" end="00:23:38.490" style="s2">produced by gas and falling out to like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.230" end="00:23:42.820" style="s2">a neutron star or black hole</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.490" end="00:23:44.890" style="s2">those are are also pretty pretty rich in</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.820" end="00:23:46.840" style="s2">energy but again they&#39;re not really that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.890" end="00:23:49.660" style="s2">common throughout our galaxy sister</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.840" end="00:23:51.550" style="s2">galaxy&#39;s history today at least and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.660" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">if you have a civilization that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.550" end="00:23:54.820" style="s2">typically can last a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.530" style="s2">years you have these supernovae</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">happening maybe a few a century at most</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.530" end="00:24:00.130" style="s2">it&#39;s very unlikely that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:03.160" style="s2">be so close that they would totally</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.130" end="00:24:04.450" style="s2">destroy that civilization yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.160" end="00:24:06.820" style="s2">thinking more as a source of metals</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.450" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">right now I think our Sun is thought to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.820" end="00:24:12.490" style="s2">be what at least a third generation star</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:14.290" style="s2">maybe maybe more and unusually late and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.490" end="00:24:17.050" style="s2">that there was a supernova not that long</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.290" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">before the Sun formed that seeded it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.050" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">with an unusual may maybe maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:25.240" style="s2">unusual rich assortment of higher atomic</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:27.550" style="s2">weight elements well that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.240" end="00:24:30.250" style="s2">good question is how many supernovae</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.550" end="00:24:33.190" style="s2">produced the elements that we use on</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.250" end="00:24:35.110" style="s2">earth that made up our solar system and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.190" end="00:24:37.420" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a tricky thing to know</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.110" end="00:24:38.560" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not just one I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.420" end="00:24:40.300" style="s2">pretty sure it&#39;s not just one it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.560" end="00:24:43.060" style="s2">probably is a collection of a mini over</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.300" end="00:24:45.280" style="s2">you know eons of time happening right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.060" end="00:24:47.590" style="s2">that the Sun the Sun formed in our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.280" end="00:24:49.480" style="s2">galaxy about eight billion years after</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.590" end="00:24:53.410" style="s2">the galaxy was born so you&#39;ve had eight</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.480" end="00:24:56.200" style="s2">billion years of evolution and and star</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.410" end="00:24:58.030" style="s2">formation and supernova happening which</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.200" end="00:25:00.460" style="s2">can produce tons of these kind of metals</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.030" end="00:25:02.020" style="s2">which the solar system formed from so</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.460" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not just one supernova but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.020" end="00:25:06.730" style="s2">likely to be very many you know got it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:10.420" style="s2">all right let&#39;s go also let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.730" end="00:25:12.100" style="s2">this key number L which yeah is you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.420" end="00:25:13.870" style="s2">again what you know why I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.100" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s so interesting to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.870" end="00:25:20.490" style="s2">about ourselves and our destiny L being</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">the average length of a communicating</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">intelligent civilization or space call</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:26.980" style="s2">it species it may not have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:30.280" style="s2">civilization but that&#39;s called a species</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.980" end="00:25:33.340" style="s2">that is able to broadcast at least for</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.280" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">these purposes radio waves out into</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.340" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">space and you know one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:38.770" style="s2">important to note is that if we use</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:41.050" style="s2">radio waves as the metric there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.770" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">ways this radio waves could stop being</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.050" end="00:25:46.110" style="s2">emitted one is the civilization loses</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">the capacity let&#39;s say it collapses</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:51.879" style="s2">either from a natural cause like an</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:54.789" style="s2">asteroid or an endogenous cause like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.879" end="00:25:56.139" style="s2">you know a nuclear war or and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.789" end="00:25:58.059" style="s2">one and you know in the study of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.139" end="00:26:00.669" style="s2">Fermi paradox comes up quite a bit is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.059" end="00:26:02.229" style="s2">maybe they stopped music radio waves and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.669" end="00:26:05.559" style="s2">I use something else you know they use</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.229" end="00:26:09.159" style="s2">gravity waves or neutrino beams or even</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.559" end="00:26:11.469" style="s2">directed laser beams some other form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.159" end="00:26:13.179" style="s2">communications that at least today we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.469" end="00:26:14.889" style="s2">would we would have it difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.179" end="00:26:16.419" style="s2">track though I do know from</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.889" end="00:26:18.969" style="s2">conversations with people in the city</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.419" end="00:26:22.449" style="s2">world they are now starting to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.969" end="00:26:24.729" style="s2">about how to detect point-to-point laser</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.449" end="00:26:27.339" style="s2">communication yeah I mean there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.729" end="00:26:28.389" style="s2">a lot to say about L right that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.339" end="00:26:29.889" style="s2">one of the key things and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.389" end="00:26:34.059" style="s2">absolutely absolutely right to say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.889" end="00:26:37.569" style="s2">it tells us about about ourselves so one</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.059" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">day when SETI actually studies the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.569" end="00:26:41.169" style="s2">entire galaxy and it won&#39;t be anytime</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.929" style="s2">soon but let&#39;s say they know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.169" end="00:26:46.209" style="s2">they know for sure that there&#39;s no life</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.929" end="00:26:48.309" style="s2">within within our galaxy at all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.209" end="00:26:49.869" style="s2">existing right now that we can detect</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.309" end="00:26:51.549" style="s2">now let&#39;s assume that they also have</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.869" end="00:26:53.649" style="s2">rolled out these things about neutrinos</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.549" end="00:26:55.629" style="s2">and gravitational waves and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.649" end="00:26:57.429" style="s2">that we know for sure that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.629" end="00:26:58.959" style="s2">other life in the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.429" end="00:27:00.669" style="s2">well that would tell us a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.959" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">things it would tell us that either the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.669" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">lifespan of the civilizations on average</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:08.589" style="s2">is very short or it would tell us that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:10.749" style="s2">we are indeed very unique in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.589" end="00:27:12.429" style="s2">our formation and that our formation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.749" end="00:27:15.429" style="s2">sort of outside of a natural progression</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.429" end="00:27:18.699" style="s2">of science but is more of a random thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.429" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">which which happened in in some random</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.699" end="00:27:23.589" style="s2">way right maybe life is just something</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">which you know you just just so happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.589" end="00:27:29.769" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t happen that by nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:32.529" style="s2">so to speak but just develops sort of on</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.769" end="00:27:35.139" style="s2">its own in its own way in a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.529" end="00:27:36.999" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand so the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.139" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">thing is is that if let&#39;s say SETI</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.999" end="00:27:42.249" style="s2">succeeds and we start finding lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:42.609" style="s2">these civilizations let&#39;s say close to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.249" end="00:27:44.529" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.609" end="00:27:46.659" style="s2">so with this thirty-six number I talked</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.529" end="00:27:49.029" style="s2">about the typical distance to those</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.659" end="00:27:51.369" style="s2">civilizations will be about seventeen</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.029" end="00:27:52.809" style="s2">thousand light-years away which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.369" end="00:27:54.819" style="s2">really far and they&#39;d be really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.809" end="00:27:58.089" style="s2">detect the signal coming from any of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.819" end="00:27:59.559" style="s2">those kind of of civilizations but</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.089" end="00:28:01.179" style="s2">simply because of the distance and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.559" end="00:28:03.459" style="s2">signal would be very weak by the time it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.179" end="00:28:05.619" style="s2">got to us but let&#39;s say you you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.459" end="00:28:05.929" style="s2">detected with SETI many civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.619" end="00:28:07.700" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.929" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">our galaxy let&#39;s say you know within our</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.700" end="00:28:11.899" style="s2">own local universe where if SETI exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:13.460" style="s2">in great abundance that&#39;s where you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.899" end="00:28:15.769" style="s2">find it first because simply that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.460" end="00:28:18.200" style="s2">these years to find then they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.769" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">really tell us something about El it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.200" end="00:28:22.070" style="s2">would tell us that L must be quite long</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">that the average lifespan of an</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.070" end="00:28:28.369" style="s2">intelligent communicating civilization</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:30.019" style="s2">in our galaxy the lifetime of that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.369" end="00:28:31.789" style="s2">quite long and that would be really good</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.019" end="00:28:34.100" style="s2">news for our own existence assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.789" end="00:28:35.869" style="s2">these creatures are similar to us and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.100" end="00:28:37.879" style="s2">the way that we have technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.869" end="00:28:39.860" style="s2">way that we can destroy ourselves the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.879" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">way that we can be destroyed as you say</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.860" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">by asteroids or by other parts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.860" end="00:28:46.879" style="s2">astronomy let&#39;s say supernovae gamma-ray</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:49.700" style="s2">bursts etc so that would really be</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.879" end="00:28:52.340" style="s2">something great for us to learn not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.700" end="00:28:53.629" style="s2">about existence of life that exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.340" end="00:28:55.999" style="s2">throughout the galaxy and other places</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.629" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">but also that actually we may have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.999" end="00:29:00.470" style="s2">chance of figuring out how to survive</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:01.999" style="s2">and on our own planet for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.470" end="00:29:04.519" style="s2">time to come and that I think would be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.999" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">great thing to know as well so it tells</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.519" end="00:29:07.850" style="s2">us not only about how where we came from</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:11.289" style="s2">but it tells us where we&#39;re going and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:13.369" style="s2">how long we might actually be around so</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.289" end="00:29:14.929" style="s2">SETI is important for both of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.369" end="00:29:17.210" style="s2">things it&#39;s really important to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.929" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">if we&#39;re alone but also tells us</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.210" end="00:29:20.119" style="s2">something about where we might be going</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:21.529" style="s2">into the future and where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.119" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">did come from so it&#39;s really answering</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.529" end="00:29:26.980" style="s2">really fundamental questions but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:30.139" style="s2">like to come back to the this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.980" end="00:29:32.570" style="s2">gravitational wave and neutrino physics</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.139" end="00:29:36.619" style="s2">and stuff being used as sort of a more</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.570" end="00:29:39.470" style="s2">difficult way of transmitting I find it</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.619" end="00:29:41.749" style="s2">hard to believe that if a civilisation</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.470" end="00:29:44.570" style="s2">arose throughout the galaxy and was</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.749" end="00:29:46.970" style="s2">intelligent and was able to develop</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.570" end="00:29:48.950" style="s2">technology that they wouldn&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.970" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">kind of phase where they actually were</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.950" end="00:29:55.460" style="s2">using similar technology that we do like</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:57.110" style="s2">electromagnetic radiation which is super</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.460" end="00:29:59.299" style="s2">common throughout the whole universe and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.110" end="00:30:02.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an easy way to communicate easy way</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.299" end="00:30:04.249" style="s2">to transmit information etc and it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.600" end="00:30:07.080" style="s2">very hard to imagine that a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.249" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">would go from being you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:12.419" style="s2">not technological to having you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:15.000" style="s2">gravitational wave communication that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.419" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">would be almost impossible to believe so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.000" end="00:30:18.510" style="s2">there must be some phase where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">actually doing some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.510" end="00:30:22.289" style="s2">electromagnetic transmission and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:26.190" style="s2">being possible to have that not escape</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.289" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">from its host planet out into space so</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.190" end="00:30:31.590" style="s2">looking for that kind of thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">is still a very valuable thing to keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.590" end="00:30:34.500" style="s2">pertaining to do now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:38.299" style="s2">criticisms I have with SETI is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.500" end="00:30:40.679" style="s2">think that these intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.299" end="00:30:42.659" style="s2">communicating civilizations actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.679" end="00:30:44.010" style="s2">necessarily want to be found</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.659" end="00:30:46.980" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re sending out</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.010" end="00:30:48.299" style="s2">huge radio signals to be found it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.980" end="00:30:50.220" style="s2">something that we would have to detect</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.220" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">out to each other and we just happen to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.260" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">catch a glimpse of it you know through</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:31:00.779" style="s2">our own our own mechanisms but but but</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">not necessarily something that was meant</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.779" end="00:31:05.220" style="s2">for us to see so and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">very hard to do because why would they</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.220" end="00:31:10.679" style="s2">send out a big signal on their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.419" style="s2">planet that we would need actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.679" end="00:31:14.039" style="s2">detected ourselves why would they send</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.419" end="00:31:16.440" style="s2">out that signal so we got to really look</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.039" end="00:31:19.830" style="s2">for very very faint signals which is why</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.440" end="00:31:21.929" style="s2">SETI looking in the radio it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.830" end="00:31:24.330" style="s2">be really difficult to do for more</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.929" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">distant objects this is outside the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.330" end="00:31:27.990" style="s2">focus your paper but something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:31.019" style="s2">talked about before with other guests is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.990" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">exactly this question what&#39;s called Medi</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.019" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">messaging extraterrestrial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:38.100" style="s2">you know there are a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:41.070" style="s2">are advocating that the human race start</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.100" end="00:31:43.380" style="s2">to broadcast to the world or to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.070" end="00:31:45.000" style="s2">universe to the galaxy at least hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.380" end="00:31:47.460" style="s2">we&#39;re here and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.000" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">faction very strongly argues that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.460" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">be the stupidest thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">right because you know using some</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.899" style="s2">evolutionary arguments it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:57.240" style="s2">that if interstellar travel wherever</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.899" end="00:32:01.139" style="s2">possible predator species may be more</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.240" end="00:32:03.299" style="s2">common than prey species and that - you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.139" end="00:32:05.669" style="s2">know yell out we&#39;re here until we know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.299" end="00:32:08.100" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the galaxy might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.669" end="00:32:11.549" style="s2">really dumb the ebony if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.100" end="00:32:13.980" style="s2">opinion on the Metis controversy yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.549" end="00:32:16.049" style="s2">of course you know I have people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.980" end="00:32:18.970" style="s2">email me now daily saying that they they</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.049" end="00:32:22.299" style="s2">do many all the time but of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.970" end="00:32:24.340" style="s2">so they think that being communicating</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.299" end="00:32:26.500" style="s2">with aliens now you&#39;d be amazed at some</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.340" end="00:32:31.059" style="s2">of the emails I get you probably buy</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.500" end="00:32:33.429" style="s2">their dental fillings right yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.059" end="00:32:36.840" style="s2">friend asking more details some of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.429" end="00:32:40.210" style="s2">messages are very exactly the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.840" end="00:32:42.070" style="s2">communication with these other</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.210" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">civilizations I think would be really</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.070" end="00:32:45.309" style="s2">hard to do not just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">distances I think this goes to the Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.309" end="00:32:49.809" style="s2">paradox to some degree if we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:52.059" style="s2">is that these great distances make it</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.809" end="00:32:54.940" style="s2">really almost impossible to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.059" end="00:32:56.919" style="s2">so if you have a something 17,000</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.940" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">light-years away and we detect them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.919" end="00:33:01.260" style="s2">we send off a signal to them when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">detect them saying hello you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.260" end="00:33:06.909" style="s2">welcome to earth or whatever then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">take 17 thousand years to get to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.909" end="00:33:10.900" style="s2">and then if they reply we take 17</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">thousand years to get back right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.900" end="00:33:14.380" style="s2">speed of light is is constant so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:15.669" style="s2">would take thirty-four thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.380" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">for us to receive an answer to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.669" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">message which is you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:21.250" style="s2">really long time it&#39;s hard to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:24.309" style="s2">that but at the same time if the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.250" end="00:33:25.870" style="s2">lifetime of those civilizations is only</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.309" end="00:33:28.090" style="s2">a few hundred years or even a few</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.870" end="00:33:29.770" style="s2">thousand years then there would be long</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.090" end="00:33:31.330" style="s2">gone by the time our signal would reach</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.770" end="00:33:32.830" style="s2">them so we really even could not</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.330" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">communicate even if they could detect</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.830" end="00:33:37.000" style="s2">our signal and could understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">then send an answer back that we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:42.309" style="s2">understand they would be long gone so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.710" end="00:33:44.919" style="s2">you have to have combination of being</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.309" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">close by but also having the long long</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.919" end="00:33:51.130" style="s2">lifetime of civilizations now this whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:53.580" style="s2">idea about being scared of aliens and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.130" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">not wanting to transmit our our</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.580" end="00:33:58.210" style="s2">information about our existence I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:01.299" style="s2">is wrong I think the reason for that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.210" end="00:34:05.110" style="s2">reason it&#39;s wrong is that if any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.299" end="00:34:07.870" style="s2">alien civilization is is so highly</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.110" end="00:34:10.990" style="s2">technical that they could come to us and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.870" end="00:34:12.359" style="s2">say and potentially destroy us which</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.990" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">they probably could if they were able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.359" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">transmit that that amount of space that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:21.220" style="s2">civilization must be very advanced much</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:23.649" style="s2">more advanced than ours</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.220" end="00:34:24.970" style="s2">so they really have been around much</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.649" end="00:34:26.379" style="s2">longer than we have I won&#39;t speculate</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.970" end="00:34:28.510" style="s2">how long but let&#39;s say you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.379" end="00:34:29.000" style="s2">thousands millions of years longer than</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.510" end="00:34:32.210" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.000" end="00:34:33.889" style="s2">then developing our technology so they</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.210" end="00:34:35.990" style="s2">have all kinds of technology which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.889" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">incredible I&#39;m sure but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.990" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">they&#39;ve also had to manage to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:44.120" style="s2">to to not destroy themselves that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:46.070" style="s2">they found a way where they they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.120" end="00:34:47.570" style="s2">you know done the equivalent of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.070" end="00:34:50.870" style="s2">war or had you know global warming</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.570" end="00:34:52.700" style="s2">destroy everybody or you know found a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.870" end="00:34:54.649" style="s2">way that to get people to wear masks</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.700" end="00:34:57.230" style="s2">when they have like Coke ovid type this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.649" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">Hesper going on like we do now so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.230" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">not everyone just dies dies away so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:04.310" style="s2">they&#39;ve managed to figure that out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.510" style="s2">that takes I think some sophistication I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.310" end="00:35:08.540" style="s2">think this is something that our own</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.510" end="00:35:10.760" style="s2">species still needs time to develop is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.540" end="00:35:14.300" style="s2">sophisticated way of being able to live</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.760" end="00:35:16.310" style="s2">together to survive for longer than a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.300" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">few hundred years with a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.310" end="00:35:20.450" style="s2">technology and this would be a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:22.220" style="s2">for humans in the coming centuries is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.450" end="00:35:23.600" style="s2">how how do we manage this we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.220" end="00:35:25.670" style="s2">had to deal with it of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.600" end="00:35:27.800" style="s2">last hundred years and it&#39;s only going</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.670" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">to get worse with things like AI and who</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.800" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">knows what else is coming up so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:33.890" style="s2">managed to do that so I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:36.650" style="s2">think that they have and maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.890" end="00:35:38.860" style="s2">just me being crazily optimistic is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.650" end="00:35:42.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve managed a way to have a a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.860" end="00:35:44.570" style="s2">philosophy or a sort of a the way they</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.920" end="00:35:46.280" style="s2">look at the universe the world and ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.570" end="00:35:47.360" style="s2">other living creatures perhaps is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.280" end="00:35:48.890" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not there to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.360" end="00:35:51.410" style="s2">destroyed but they&#39;re there to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.890" end="00:35:53.900" style="s2">live and some kind of you know harmony</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.410" end="00:35:55.640" style="s2">or or whatever you know what have you in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.900" end="00:36:00.200" style="s2">terms of not just destroying things but</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.640" end="00:36:02.150" style="s2">finding a way to be peaceful to manage</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.200" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">things better so that&#39;s the way I like</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.150" end="00:36:06.050" style="s2">to think of it now I could be wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.790" style="s2">if you know if an alien does come out on</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.050" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">lands on earth I certainly wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.790" end="00:36:12.890" style="s2">to be the first person to come talk to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:16.040" style="s2">it but that&#39;s the way that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.890" end="00:36:18.170" style="s2">like to see it and and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.040" end="00:36:19.660" style="s2">the reason that they could survive so</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.170" end="00:36:22.460" style="s2">long that they must have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.660" end="00:36:24.290" style="s2">understanding that destruction is not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.460" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">good way of keeping their civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.290" end="00:36:29.720" style="s2">afloat so that that&#39;s kind of how I see</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:32.090" style="s2">that one and actually that&#39;s may</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.720" end="00:36:34.190" style="s2">actually be an argument to urgently send</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.090" end="00:36:36.170" style="s2">out many messages I mean it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.190" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">we have lots of ways to kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.170" end="00:36:42.589" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a lifeboat made a message hey</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:44.930" style="s2">we&#39;re about that blow our planet up I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.589" end="00:36:46.969" style="s2">nuclear weapons or fry ourselves or let</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.930" end="00:36:48.829" style="s2">loose nanobots that turn the planet into</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.969" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">gray goo or something how is there was</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.829" end="00:36:53.269" style="s2">anybody else out there that managed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:56.089" style="s2">get past all these traps please tell us</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.269" end="00:36:58.910" style="s2">how you did it of course for your</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.089" end="00:37:01.039" style="s2">calculation it might be 17,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.910" end="00:37:03.019" style="s2">before we got the answer in which case</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.039" end="00:37:04.549" style="s2">it may well be too late in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.019" end="00:37:06.559" style="s2">I had a thought when you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.549" end="00:37:08.539" style="s2">that that there&#39;s another calculation</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.559" end="00:37:10.729" style="s2">you could do from your calculations</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.539" end="00:37:12.680" style="s2">I would encourage your student to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.729" end="00:37:16.249" style="s2">this which is that let&#39;s say you set a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.680" end="00:37:18.019" style="s2">parameter that you want to civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.249" end="00:37:21.079" style="s2">to be able to do at least five round</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.019" end="00:37:23.299" style="s2">trips to be able to exchange their</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.079" end="00:37:26.569" style="s2">knowledge and touch points and translate</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.299" end="00:37:31.569" style="s2">each other&#39;s languages etc there is some</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.569" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">El which will then create a probability</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.569" end="00:37:39.019" style="s2">map of how big does El have to be to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:40.700" style="s2">have a 50% chance say of there being a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.019" end="00:37:42.529" style="s2">civilization for which you could have</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.700" end="00:37:44.539" style="s2">five round trips I know you can derive</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.529" end="00:37:46.309" style="s2">that from the numbers that you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.539" end="00:37:47.779" style="s2">put together I&#39;d encourage you guys to</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.309" end="00:37:50.630" style="s2">do that it would be very very</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.779" end="00:37:52.789" style="s2">interesting does El have to be a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.630" end="00:37:54.259" style="s2">thousand to be able to have a high</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.789" end="00:37:56.690" style="s2">enough density what&#39;s a cool thing about</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.259" end="00:37:58.940" style="s2">your calculations as the longer el is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.690" end="00:38:01.579" style="s2">the higher the density is and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.940" end="00:38:03.559" style="s2">the more round trips you can have both</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.579" end="00:38:04.999" style="s2">because they&#39;re closer and because L is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.559" end="00:38:06.319" style="s2">longer they don&#39;t blow up while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.999" end="00:38:07.369" style="s2">trying to have the round trip so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.319" end="00:38:09.759" style="s2">would be kind of a fun number to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.369" end="00:38:13.700" style="s2">calculate yeah and it might actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.759" end="00:38:14.450" style="s2">tend to rule out a tight-knit well I</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.700" end="00:38:15.349" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it would tell you I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:17.089" style="s2">would love to do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.349" end="00:38:18.319" style="s2">what another topic for we&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.089" end="00:38:22.039" style="s2">final one which would be the Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.319" end="00:38:27.170" style="s2">paradox is in addition to SETI classic</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.039" end="00:38:30.109" style="s2">search for radio and also just beginning</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.170" end="00:38:31.849" style="s2">laser another branch of SETI that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.109" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">getting more and more attention is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.849" end="00:38:37.130" style="s2">techno signatures branch of SETI where</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:40.150" style="s2">instead of looking for emissions we look</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.130" end="00:38:44.390" style="s2">at things that might be masking the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.150" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">emissions of the of stars in fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.390" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">there&#39;s you know still one oddball</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">candidate that has this odd variable</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:56.670" style="s2">signature of solar emissions which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">not known to to meet up with any know</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.670" end="00:39:01.470" style="s2">you know type of star and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.180" style="s2">have things conceptually like the Dyson</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.470" end="00:39:05.670" style="s2">shell which is an advanced enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.180" end="00:39:07.740" style="s2">civilization builds a shell around its</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.670" end="00:39:10.080" style="s2">star to harvest all the energy or a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.740" end="00:39:12.660" style="s2">lesser version the Dyson ring which is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.080" end="00:39:15.480" style="s2">ring around its star which includes a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.660" end="00:39:16.500" style="s2">fair amount of the solar energy and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.480" end="00:39:19.020" style="s2">the people are starting to look at four</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.500" end="00:39:20.760" style="s2">techno signatures as well and so far</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.020" end="00:39:22.230" style="s2">they haven&#39;t found any obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.760" end="00:39:24.360" style="s2">there&#39;s you know at least one candidate</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.230" end="00:39:25.080" style="s2">Tabitha&#39;s star I think it&#39;s called is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.360" end="00:39:26.670" style="s2">that what it&#39;s called yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.080" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah so your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.670" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">techno signatures and what they might</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:34.470" style="s2">help or hurt or help refine some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.220" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">these numbers in in your revised</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.470" end="00:39:40.260" style="s2">equation yeah I I really think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">the most likely way that we&#39;ll find a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.260" end="00:39:44.490" style="s2">Chetty civilization throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">throughout the galaxy or even in other</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.490" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">galaxies something that really hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:52.050" style="s2">been done too much as look look for</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.940" end="00:39:54.180" style="s2">communicating intelligent life so to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.050" end="00:39:55.890" style="s2">speak and other other galaxies because</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.180" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">there&#39;s two trillion galaxies in our</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.890" end="00:39:59.070" style="s2">universe and we&#39;re only really looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.300" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">at one not really only looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.070" end="00:40:05.160" style="s2">small small volume of that one galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:07.620" style="s2">with traditional SETI so I&#39;m a big fan</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.160" end="00:40:09.840" style="s2">of looking for techno signatures now</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.620" end="00:40:12.060" style="s2">people have done searches for Dyson</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.840" end="00:40:14.790" style="s2">spheres in our own galaxy using the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.060" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">infrared looking for basically anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.790" end="00:40:19.050" style="s2">which is a bright in the infrared which</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:20.670" style="s2">is unexpected and they haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.050" end="00:40:21.870" style="s2">found anything there&#39;s really no good</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.670" end="00:40:23.250" style="s2">candidates for that throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.870" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">galaxy it doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.250" end="00:40:28.410" style="s2">it&#39;s just that what we can see so far we</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:31.140" style="s2">haven&#39;t really seen anything but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.410" end="00:40:32.430" style="s2">might just be our own galaxy so if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.140" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">have so many galaxies throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.430" end="00:40:36.570" style="s2">universe and you have some probability</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:38.820" style="s2">of each galaxy having an advanced</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.570" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">technology then if you have enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.820" end="00:40:43.230" style="s2">galaxies eventually you&#39;ll find a galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:46.110" style="s2">which which has had a telogen life in it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.230" end="00:40:48.630" style="s2">for millions of years or so hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.110" end="00:40:51.060" style="s2">millions of years maybe and over that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.630" end="00:40:53.790" style="s2">period of time you can really do a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.060" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">mean you can really take over the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.790" end="00:40:57.330" style="s2">perhaps if you look at the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">humans of our technology has expanded</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.330" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">them off the last season just a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:04.830" style="s2">years just imagine what we could do if</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:06.600" style="s2">that rate of technology continued for</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.830" end="00:41:07.770" style="s2">for centuries or thousands of years or</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.600" end="00:41:08.760" style="s2">millions of years it would just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.770" end="00:41:11.640" style="s2">unimaginable</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.760" end="00:41:13.410" style="s2">we can do so that I think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.640" end="00:41:15.990" style="s2">good approach to looking for cities to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.410" end="00:41:20.150" style="s2">try to find these kind of alien art</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.990" end="00:41:22.110" style="s2">archaeology archeoastronomy type things</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.150" end="00:41:23.940" style="s2">throughout the throughout the universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.110" end="00:41:25.620" style="s2">not just our own galaxy but but in other</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.940" end="00:41:29.190" style="s2">galaxies now of course the question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.620" end="00:41:30.950" style="s2">how do you find such a thing okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.190" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s really the trick what would these</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.950" end="00:41:37.320" style="s2">you know technology signatures look like</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:39.030" style="s2">even on a small scale within the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.320" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">right would they just be Dyson spheres</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.030" end="00:41:44.670" style="s2">but they&#39;d just be stars that are all</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:45.930" style="s2">sort of taken up by a sphere around them</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.670" end="00:41:47.910" style="s2">where the light can&#39;t be seen at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.930" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">at least not in the optical but in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.910" end="00:41:51.960" style="s2">only emits maybe an infrared or would it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:54.630" style="s2">be something else and it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.960" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">to imagine what other things you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.630" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">do I mean you can imagine maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:01.970" style="s2">move stars around maybe a galaxy has its</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:04.590" style="s2">shape changed by these these</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.970" end="00:42:06.060" style="s2">communicating civilizations I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.590" end="00:42:08.310" style="s2">call communicating but these highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.060" end="00:42:10.470" style="s2">technical civilizations in other</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.310" end="00:42:12.600" style="s2">galaxies that can move stars around they</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.470" end="00:42:14.310" style="s2">could have big regions of Dyson spheres</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.600" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">they can you know dim the whole galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.310" end="00:42:18.630" style="s2">so they can they can power up their</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:21.990" style="s2">civilization to do whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.630" end="00:42:25.140" style="s2">they remember they need to do so I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.990" end="00:42:27.120" style="s2">that&#39;s really a good a good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.140" end="00:42:29.190" style="s2">look for them there&#39;s very little work</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.120" end="00:42:32.580" style="s2">on that so people have done a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.190" end="00:42:34.080" style="s2">looking in external galaxies for things</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:37.250" style="s2">and I&#39;ve actually done a project on this</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.080" end="00:42:40.730" style="s2">myself recently with some students</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.250" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">looking for galaxies which deviate from</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.730" end="00:42:45.240" style="s2">what we call scaling laws which is we</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">have a very tight relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.240" end="00:42:49.560" style="s2">two quantities if the galaxy falls off</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.540" style="s2">that relationship a good question is why</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.560" end="00:42:53.010" style="s2">does it do that and one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.540" end="00:42:54.810" style="s2">might do it is if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.010" end="00:42:56.610" style="s2">altering the shape of the galaxy or</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.810" end="00:42:57.990" style="s2">that&#39;s light and one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.610" end="00:43:00.450" style="s2">could be an intelligence now it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.990" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">very likely and in fact we didn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.450" end="00:43:03.630" style="s2">anything either</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:05.580" style="s2">but it&#39;s possible and so people have</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.630" end="00:43:08.580" style="s2">done this a little bit and this has been</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.580" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">going around I don&#39;t know a long time</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.580" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">now thirty years as probably as long as</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:14.460" style="s2">people have been looking at this but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:17.490" style="s2">has been the papers on this are very few</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.460" end="00:43:19.320" style="s2">so there&#39;s big gaps with like five five</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.490" end="00:43:21.030" style="s2">ten years where no one does anything but</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.320" end="00:43:22.850" style="s2">there had been papers in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.030" end="00:43:24.350" style="s2">for the last thirty years or so</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.850" end="00:43:26.810" style="s2">where people have looked for these kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.350" end="00:43:28.970" style="s2">of things in external galaxies but very</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.810" end="00:43:30.410" style="s2">few people are working on that and SETI</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.970" end="00:43:32.990" style="s2">the mainstream SETI is really looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.410" end="00:43:35.030" style="s2">for these radio signals and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.990" end="00:43:37.220" style="s2">laser like you said coming from nearby</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.030" end="00:43:39.060" style="s2">stars but I really think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.220" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">think more about</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.060" end="00:43:46.610" style="s2">about looking for the kind of of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:49.050" style="s2">alien signatures in the technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.610" end="00:43:51.840" style="s2">overtaking part or all of it all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.050" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">galaxy I&#39;m really keen to see more</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.840" end="00:43:57.180" style="s2">people do that yeah it does annoy the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:59.990" style="s2">hell out of me that have you know SETI</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.180" end="00:44:02.760" style="s2">is to my mind the second most important</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.990" end="00:44:04.470" style="s2">scientific question and unlike the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.760" end="00:44:05.880" style="s2">most important question why is there</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.470" end="00:44:07.860" style="s2">something rather than nothing we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.880" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">actually do something about it why is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.860" end="00:44:13.560" style="s2">the funding for SETI so small and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">know and as we talked about early on and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.560" end="00:44:18.440" style="s2">in your introduction why is it even</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:22.050" style="s2">considered dangerous for a career in</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.440" end="00:44:24.330" style="s2">astronomy or astrophysics to be a SETI</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.050" end="00:44:26.370" style="s2">person it seems to me that if this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.330" end="00:44:28.260" style="s2">such a huge question and we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.370" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">at the place where we&#39;re getting real</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.260" end="00:44:33.750" style="s2">data why shouldn&#39;t this be funded at you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:36.300" style="s2">know hundreds of millions of dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.750" end="00:44:37.800" style="s2">year right that that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.300" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">question and and I thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.800" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">this and if you look at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:44.610" style="s2">astronomy</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:47.130" style="s2">there really are topics which are</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.610" end="00:44:48.870" style="s2">somewhat taboo and and and discouraged</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.130" end="00:44:52.500" style="s2">from people looking at even astrophysics</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.870" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">itself 150 years ago was considered to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.500" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">be sort of a rogue thing and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.690" end="00:44:58.890" style="s2">considered to be mainstream astronomy</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:00.900" style="s2">astronomy back then was looking at star</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.890" end="00:45:03.210" style="s2">positions and stuff like that and people</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.900" end="00:45:05.250" style="s2">like August comp the philosopher the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.210" end="00:45:08.430" style="s2">French philosopher says said in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.250" end="00:45:09.960" style="s2">beginning of the of the mid of the mid</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.430" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">19th century that we&#39;ll never know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.960" end="00:45:13.800" style="s2">stars are made of these kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:16.440" style="s2">but then people got spectrographs</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.800" end="00:45:18.300" style="s2">started looking at stars and finally</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.440" end="00:45:20.310" style="s2">yeah we know you know only a few years</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.300" end="00:45:22.500" style="s2">after he said that people knew what</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.310" end="00:45:24.750" style="s2">stars were made of and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.500" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">good a great example which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.750" end="00:45:32.310" style="s2">closest example to to SETI is cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:33.960" style="s2">so for a very long time people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.310" end="00:45:35.880" style="s2">thought about the idea of where did the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.960" end="00:45:37.650" style="s2">universe come from how did it start how</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.880" end="00:45:39.660" style="s2">old is it all this stuff we&#39;re thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.650" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">to be y&#39;all this is religion this is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.660" end="00:45:43.230" style="s2">something that really a serious</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.450" style="s2">scientist should look at but of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.230" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">now cosmology is ism is mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.450" end="00:45:50.070" style="s2">astronomy it&#39;s a mainstream astrophysics</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:52.859" style="s2">and it in some ways dominates the field</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.070" end="00:45:54.569" style="s2">dominates the funding so SETI</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.859" end="00:45:57.180" style="s2">is similar to that and you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.569" end="00:45:59.369" style="s2">right that is one of the big questions</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.180" end="00:46:00.599" style="s2">is it&#39;s really up there with with top</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.369" end="00:46:03.690" style="s2">two or three questions you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.599" end="00:46:05.789" style="s2">possibly ask in all science so why is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.690" end="00:46:07.739" style="s2">not really well respected I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.789" end="00:46:09.269" style="s2">simply because there&#39;s really no data</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.739" end="00:46:11.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.269" end="00:46:13.529" style="s2">you had with the problem with cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.130" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">so certainly when wherever whenever we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.529" end="00:46:17.999" style="s2">do detect sort of life and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:20.099" style="s2">will happen next decade or so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.999" end="00:46:22.499" style="s2">will detect some kind of life on other</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.099" end="00:46:24.359" style="s2">planets evidence for it but that life</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.499" end="00:46:26.279" style="s2">will be very simple you know could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.359" end="00:46:28.559" style="s2">analogous to plants or something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.279" end="00:46:30.239" style="s2">that and it&#39;ll be found just by looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.559" end="00:46:32.579" style="s2">at chemical elements and the atmospheres</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.239" end="00:46:35.670" style="s2">of planets which is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.579" end="00:46:37.650" style="s2">can do now quite quite easily although</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.670" end="00:46:39.509" style="s2">not not to the ability to find evidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.650" end="00:46:41.700" style="s2">for life but there are many new</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.509" end="00:46:43.829" style="s2">telescopes coming online like James Webb</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.700" end="00:46:45.420" style="s2">Space Telescope and these big new</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.829" end="00:46:48.329" style="s2">telescopes that&#39;ll be 30 meters in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.420" end="00:46:49.799" style="s2">diameter on the ground that can can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.329" end="00:46:52.289" style="s2">these federer scopic studies that can</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.799" end="00:46:54.269" style="s2">find these elements and molecules and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.289" end="00:46:56.369" style="s2">the atmospheres of planets which can</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.269" end="00:46:57.449" style="s2">tell us that perhaps or definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.369" end="00:46:59.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.449" end="00:47:01.259" style="s2">probably some form of life so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.640" end="00:47:03.059" style="s2">that will happen and that I think will</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.259" end="00:47:05.459" style="s2">help a lot I think when we discover that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.059" end="00:47:07.109" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a lot more enthusiasm for</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.459" end="00:47:08.699" style="s2">looking for intelligent life which will</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.109" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">be much harder to find glad you</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.699" end="00:47:11.549" style="s2">mentioned that I was going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:14.430" style="s2">which is that we&#39;re right on the verge</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.549" end="00:47:16.650" style="s2">of either detecting or not</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.430" end="00:47:20.759" style="s2">XO life by looking at the spectroscopy</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.650" end="00:47:22.859" style="s2">of atmospheres of exoplanets and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.759" end="00:47:24.329" style="s2">possible it might be a dry hole I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.859" end="00:47:27.809" style="s2">you know it could be that we&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.329" end="00:47:30.630" style="s2">several hundred habitable zone planet</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.809" end="00:47:32.789" style="s2">atmospheres and find no life signature</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.630" end="00:47:34.979" style="s2">which would you know start to fill in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.789" end="00:47:37.049" style="s2">one of the terms in the in the equation</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.979" end="00:47:40.579" style="s2">in the original Drake Equation at least</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.049" end="00:47:42.959" style="s2">which you guys chose to not get into</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.579" end="00:47:45.209" style="s2">which I think it&#39;s a perfect transition</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.959" end="00:47:48.509" style="s2">to the Drake Drake Equation to the Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.209" end="00:47:50.219" style="s2">paradox right as people listen the show</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.509" end="00:47:53.069" style="s2">know anyone with a scientific background</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.219" end="00:47:56.279" style="s2">I always ask them about their view of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.069" end="00:47:58.859" style="s2">the Fermi paradox and to restate the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.279" end="00:48:00.269" style="s2">Fermi paradox it goes back to Los Alamos</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.859" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">at least this is the story that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.269" end="00:48:03.989" style="s2">heard or a bunch of young scientists</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:05.570" style="s2">sitting at the lunch table we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.989" end="00:48:08.990" style="s2">speculating oh there&#39;s got to be one</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.770" end="00:48:15.140" style="s2">yada yada and Enrico Fermi the famous</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.560" end="00:48:15.800" style="s2">physicist came up to him and said where</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.140" end="00:48:18.500" style="s2">are they</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.800" end="00:48:21.050" style="s2">and if they&#39;re there where are they and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.500" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s been the you know this question</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.050" end="00:48:26.930" style="s2">the Fermi paradox how many are there and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.600" end="00:48:28.370" style="s2">if there really are some you know why</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.930" end="00:48:30.890" style="s2">haven&#39;t we seen any sign of them and</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.860" end="00:48:40.760" style="s2">tends to divide the analysis up into two</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.860" end="00:49:19.670" style="s2">but what happened during the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.090" end="00:49:21.980" style="s2">before the Cambrian explosion 540</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.670" end="00:49:24.350" style="s2">million years ago where the template</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.980" end="00:49:26.660" style="s2">that was laid down for all interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.350" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">multicellular life of our sort and every</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.660" end="00:49:32.690" style="s2">other interesting animal we know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:35.780" style="s2">that was a really weird long shot or</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.690" end="00:49:37.880" style="s2">maybe the development of chloroplasts</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.780" end="00:49:39.020" style="s2">was an exceedingly long shot I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.880" end="00:49:41.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned now that&#39;s happened more</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.020" end="00:49:43.250" style="s2">than once so that&#39;s one side then</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.480" end="00:49:44.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of others you know on</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.250" end="00:49:47.480" style="s2">the other side which is everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.990" end="00:49:51.470" style="s2">eaten by their a eyes within a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.480" end="00:49:52.850" style="s2">years right or they this decide you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.470" end="00:49:54.950" style="s2">the dark forest there and got to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.850" end="00:49:56.600" style="s2">quiet there&#39;s bad guys out there so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.950" end="00:49:57.560" style="s2">love to know your thoughts I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.600" end="00:49:59.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve been working in this space you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.560" end="00:50:01.670" style="s2">have to speculated about the Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.540" end="00:50:03.290" style="s2">paradox if you have to put your flag on</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:05.840" style="s2">the ground why haven&#39;t we detected</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:07.700" style="s2">anybody yeah yeah it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.840" end="00:50:10.490" style="s2">right and yeah indeed I have thought a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.700" end="00:50:13.310" style="s2">lot about this so my solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.490" end="00:50:17.510" style="s2">Fermi paradox is simply just the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.310" end="00:50:19.130" style="s2">distances and rarity so if if these kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.510" end="00:50:22.340" style="s2">of communicating</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.130" end="00:50:24.440" style="s2">extraterrestrials are rare then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.340" end="00:50:25.820" style="s2">going to be far away and if they&#39;re far</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.440" end="00:50:27.710" style="s2">away they&#39;re going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.820" end="00:50:29.930" style="s2">difficult to detect and I would say a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.710" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">third thing is perhaps the lifetime of</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.930" end="00:50:32.750" style="s2">civilizations is not as long as we would</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:35.450" style="s2">like to think they are that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.750" end="00:50:38.060" style="s2">actually not not very long so if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.450" end="00:50:39.770" style="s2">have those three things and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.060" end="00:50:41.840" style="s2">those three then then it&#39;s easy to solve</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.770" end="00:50:43.820" style="s2">the Fermi paradox it&#39;s simply that there</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.840" end="00:50:45.800" style="s2">are maybe a couple of civilizations in</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.820" end="00:50:51.020" style="s2">our galaxy but they&#39;re really primitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.800" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">like us or close to us and they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.020" end="00:50:53.990" style="s2">so far away that we&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:56.180" style="s2">detect them and they&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.990" end="00:50:59.390" style="s2">detect us now you have to remember if</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.180" end="00:51:02.510" style="s2">someone&#39;s looking at us and earth they</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.390" end="00:51:04.520" style="s2">would never see that we have a technical</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.510" end="00:51:07.640" style="s2">civilization unless they&#39;re about 100</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.520" end="00:51:09.560" style="s2">light years away from us or closer if</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.640" end="00:51:12.170" style="s2">they&#39;re further than that we still look</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.560" end="00:51:13.940" style="s2">like a normal planet right we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.170" end="00:51:15.620" style="s2">don&#39;t even barely have lights happening</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.940" end="00:51:17.600" style="s2">lights are a bit or more than hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.620" end="00:51:19.790" style="s2">years but anyway you get the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.600" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">that our bubble of intelligence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.790" end="00:51:24.590" style="s2">projecting out into space is only about</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:26.780" style="s2">a hundred light-years in radius which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.590" end="00:51:28.820" style="s2">not very big for the size of the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.780" end="00:51:30.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s very likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.820" end="00:51:31.580" style="s2">intelligent life within a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.320" end="00:51:33.410" style="s2">light-years of us it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.580" end="00:51:35.030" style="s2">unlikely those stars and we certainly</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.410" end="00:51:36.260" style="s2">don&#39;t have it or us we definitely would</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.030" end="00:51:37.640" style="s2">have noticed something by now I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.260" end="00:51:40.460" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.640" end="00:51:43.580" style="s2">by the fact that it&#39;s so rare and and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.460" end="00:51:45.110" style="s2">far away it&#39;s unlikely to be unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.580" end="00:51:47.570" style="s2">be seen and then if you have a short</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.110" end="00:51:48.830" style="s2">lifetime then also unlikely to be seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.570" end="00:51:51.890" style="s2">something because they don&#39;t last long</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.830" end="00:51:54.500" style="s2">enough to develop a highly technical</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.890" end="00:51:57.050" style="s2">civilization that could reproduce itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.500" end="00:51:58.970" style="s2">on other stars or make robots that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.050" end="00:52:01.790" style="s2">reproduce themselves and don&#39;t even need</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.970" end="00:52:03.800" style="s2">the you know the biological alien</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.790" end="00:52:06.020" style="s2">anymore but can survive for you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.800" end="00:52:08.900" style="s2">perhaps tens of millions of years just</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.020" end="00:52:12.080" style="s2">by self-replication and going throughout</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.900" end="00:52:13.310" style="s2">the galaxy just you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.080" end="00:52:14.990" style="s2">eventually would come to us but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.310" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen that so that was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.990" end="00:52:18.380" style="s2">another sign that I think that this this</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:19.910" style="s2">lifetime of these civilizations isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.380" end="00:52:21.710" style="s2">very long but it could be combined with</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.910" end="00:52:23.330" style="s2">the rarity of them as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.710" end="00:52:24.980" style="s2">another reason why I think looking at</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.330" end="00:52:27.690" style="s2">external galaxies is another way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.980" end="00:52:29.830" style="s2">trying to find to find these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.690" end="00:52:33.340" style="s2">okay that&#39;s interesting so essentially</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.830" end="00:52:35.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a density is low and the average</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.340" end="00:52:37.570" style="s2">life time is short you run the math and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.860" end="00:52:39.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not surprising at all that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.570" end="00:52:40.870" style="s2">haven&#39;t detected any but I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.000" end="00:52:43.210" style="s2">yeah you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.870" end="00:52:44.770" style="s2">in your paper that it&#39;s based on some</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.210" end="00:52:46.930" style="s2">reasonable set of assumptions even</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.770" end="00:52:48.820" style="s2">including your rather optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.930" end="00:52:50.830" style="s2">assumption that life is easy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.820" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">right it might well take thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.830" end="00:52:57.640" style="s2">thousands of years to detect a a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.710" end="00:52:59.800" style="s2">civilization via that you know the</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.800" end="00:53:04.510" style="s2">SETI space and obviously we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.170" end="00:53:06.670" style="s2">doing it for 50 or 60 years right okay</p>
