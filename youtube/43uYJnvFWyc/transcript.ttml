<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">or the cloud okay so sounds good so as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:11.130" style="s2">said you&#39;re the person that sparked this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">project right the whole project of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.130" end="00:00:18.470" style="s2">reinventing dia logos and argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:21.350" style="s2">and you know some of our core concepts</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.470" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">the cultivation of virtue and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.350" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">because you proposed to me that what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">needed right now is a motorcycle</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">technology and so I&#39;m asking you if this</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:36.930" style="s2">project seems to be on track towards</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">addressing that yeah so the so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.930" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">context sisters worked back we had that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">we had I think three things that felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">like they were all at the same level and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">one one of them was a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:53.449" style="s2">psychology and it&#39;s interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">now I actually have two we do the entire</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.449" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">conversation I cannot remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">three were but the absence the absence</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">of a meta psychology in practice was it</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">was a it was a hole right and so there</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">was a need to do that and and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">you were moving in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">so so so let&#39;s when putting the be in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">context what what happens there okay so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal here&#39;s the context the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:31.549" style="s2">big picture or the context we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">in we have a lot we have to do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.549" end="00:01:36.900" style="s2">enormous amount of work more or less at</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">the level of culture that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.900" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">done and by the way you can put like</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">scare quotes around that or boldness</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">because I&#39;m speaking it in a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">don&#39;t really have words to describe the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">magnitude and we don&#39;t have much time in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">which to do it we&#39;re trying to in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">it invent or design a culture a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">culture right a whole thing that holds</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">the totality of humaneness in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">relationship with nature and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">doing that over thousands of years or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">hundreds of years we&#39;re doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">couple of decades or maybe three</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">generations but with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">we&#39;re happening early and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">definitely not even ever being vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">done before so it&#39;s it&#39;s novel we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">we&#39;re not even doing it for the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:30.120" style="s2">and third time we&#39;re doing it for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:32.190" style="s2">first time so one and done one shot this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.120" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">is kind of thing vast in scope</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.190" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">short in time in the context by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">where the reason why we&#39;re having to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">it is that the thing that has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">holding us together at a very high level</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:46.520" style="s2">of entropy you know there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">that has moved just up the ladder from</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.520" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">subsistence agriculture to billion</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:53.520" style="s2">people that can kind of be held well by</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">if you drop far you don&#39;t drop that far</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.520" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">has taken is really high we&#39;ve got eight</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">billion people now with very with vast</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:02.730" style="s2">supply chains that have 15 different</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">levels of Technology between the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.730" end="00:03:07.770" style="s2">production and the actual mode of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">resource connection you know bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.770" end="00:03:15.270" style="s2">flying everywhere the you know a complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.900" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">civilization structure and that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.270" end="00:03:19.800" style="s2">know is breaking evidently</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">self-evidently</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.800" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">and we can talk of course we can talk at</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">nauseam about why what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">and how that&#39;s happening but the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2">is that things breaking so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:32.520" style="s2">invent or design or co-create or gen</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">create the seed crystal allows the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.520" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">autopoietic development of this new</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">thing bra rapidly in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:43.320" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re currently sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">top of collapsing rapidly which that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.320" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">creates all kinds of entropy and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">little earthquakes in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:52.130" style="s2">they&#39;re operating under okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:53.820" style="s2">what&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s working against us</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.130" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">some of the things that are working</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.820" end="00:03:59.100" style="s2">against us this is not happening all at</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">once you know you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.100" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">demeaning crisis for example and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">beautifully so and we are all exponents</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:08.370" style="s2">of having been in the result and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">consequence of the meeting crisis for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.370" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">generations yes so we are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">suffering from being having having you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">know centuries of a building meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">crisis and the and the socio technical</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">so the individual beings who are trying</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:33.830" style="s2">problem are very broken and the ideas</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.830" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">methodologies that we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:40.699" style="s2">are very broken okay that&#39;s all what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:42.169" style="s2">on the scale up against us what do we</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:54.440" style="s2">in fact communicate with each other in</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.000" end="00:05:02.449" style="s2">super new like at the level of</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.180" end="00:05:27.349" style="s2">say well categorically nothing that we</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:41.159" style="s2">we can&#39;t require too much change in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:50.710" style="s2">psycho-spiritual cognitive capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.629" end="00:06:54.520" style="s2">humans we can we can&#39;t can expect and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.710" end="00:06:56.860" style="s2">and should require some degree of skin</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.520" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">in the game like I&#39;m I will commit to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.860" end="00:07:00.819" style="s2">being transformed I will commit to being</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:02.259" style="s2">transformed by this and by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.819" end="00:07:04.300" style="s2">transformation will be a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.259" end="00:07:06.159" style="s2">for the better for myself I will feel in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">myself and up gradient and my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.159" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">personal well-being and also</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:14.199" style="s2">synergistically my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:15.639" style="s2">participate in this larger story and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.199" end="00:07:19.719" style="s2">I am boomed with a local and a global</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.639" end="00:07:21.069" style="s2">increase by participation but we will</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.719" end="00:07:24.129" style="s2">not have expectation so can I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.069" end="00:07:25.719" style="s2">expectations that human capacity at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.129" end="00:07:28.089" style="s2">individual level will go from call it 2</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.719" end="00:07:30.310" style="s2">to 9 right maybe from 2 to 3 or 2 to 4</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.089" end="00:07:33.159" style="s2">maybe 2 to 2.5 write something in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.310" end="00:07:34.449" style="s2">zone meaning that this meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.159" end="00:07:36.909" style="s2">technology needs to be the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.449" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">that people can do people as they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.909" end="00:07:40.900" style="s2">can begin to engage in it and and as</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:43.149" style="s2">they engage in it they should become</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.900" end="00:07:45.879" style="s2">more capacitance as individuals and by</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.149" end="00:07:48.069" style="s2">the way then as groups check check check</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.879" end="00:07:50.589" style="s2">I see a lot of that I mean I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.069" end="00:07:52.300" style="s2">see that the things that you and Chris</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.589" end="00:07:53.409" style="s2">and the conversations that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.300" end="00:07:54.460" style="s2">and to the degree which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.409" end="00:07:58.449" style="s2">participating in they&#39;re happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.460" end="00:08:03.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a large chunk of the population</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.449" end="00:08:08.110" style="s2">can perceive it and can begin to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.779" end="00:08:14.069" style="s2">transformed by it and and then begin to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.110" end="00:08:14.069" style="s2">participate in it at least go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.649" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">I enjoy partaking because they have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.020" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">almost a cathedral structure to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">like the way I like you almost mapping</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">them out in space you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">really appreciate that so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:42.409" style="s2">that it&#39;s why it&#39;s often very helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">talk to you for precisely that reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.409" end="00:08:52.710" style="s2">yes I wanted to say yeah I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:54.270" style="s2">observation on our guinea I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.710" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">not scientific evidence it&#39;s anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.270" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">evidence but that&#39;s all that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">right now that because what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">I&#39;m teaching online the meditation class</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">the contemplation casts so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:09.480" style="s2">doing is I&#39;m giving people you know some</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">basic mindfulness instruction and these</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">principles about building an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:15.570" style="s2">practices right how do you get various</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:17.310" style="s2">practices to complement each other for</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.570" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses how can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.310" end="00:09:21.870" style="s2">layer practices one practice on top of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:24.060" style="s2">another so how can I build Praja out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.870" end="00:09:26.130" style="s2">meditation and contemplation and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.060" end="00:09:28.950" style="s2">linking practices how can I take a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.130" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">silent meditative practice and then link</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.950" end="00:09:32.820" style="s2">it to discursive practice well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">linking practice called Alexio Divina</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.820" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">that moves people from and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:39.510" style="s2">undoing that and people are taking it up</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.960" end="00:09:41.730" style="s2">so they&#39;re there they&#39;re doing the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.510" end="00:09:43.560" style="s2">mindful practices entering into lectio</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.730" end="00:09:45.450" style="s2">divina and then follow up feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.560" end="00:09:48.089" style="s2">almost called naturally in 2d above</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.450" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">those as a process so I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.089" end="00:09:52.530" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to get some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">architectonic of it like these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:56.580" style="s2">connections like they say be the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:09:58.020" style="s2">the looping connections where you find</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.580" end="00:10:00.960" style="s2">you things are put together in</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.020" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2">relationships of complementarity mutual</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.960" end="00:10:04.710" style="s2">constraint of mutual can four affords</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.000" end="00:10:06.870" style="s2">because they have you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.710" end="00:10:09.030" style="s2">trade-off strengths and weaknesses and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.870" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">then you are layering how you can you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.030" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">know you build this practice and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:14.550" style="s2">this this practice can be layered on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.600" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2">and exact it and then you have linking</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.550" end="00:10:18.570" style="s2">practices how can I link between</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">practices that are giving infant this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.570" end="00:10:22.500" style="s2">giving emphasis to perspective on though</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.310" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">and this is giving emphasis and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.500" end="00:10:27.450" style="s2">how do I do the linking in something and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">then and then if you notice what it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.450" end="00:10:33.450" style="s2">is it&#39;s a progression that&#39;s designed I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.670" style="s2">hope to be as efficient as possible in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.450" end="00:10:38.130" style="s2">the in their sense that people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.670" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">building an ecology of practice but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.130" end="00:10:44.250" style="s2">building into the meta cycle technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:47.280" style="s2">which then could feed back on the entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.250" end="00:10:51.030" style="s2">ecology so that those are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.280" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">design ideas that are emerging in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.030" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2">trying to actually put this together oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:58.740" style="s2">man yeah like all I can say to that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">that feels it feels really good like</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.740" end="00:11:07.890" style="s2">it&#39;s the feeling of so I&#39;ll just I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:09.480" style="s2">kind of narrative my internal experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.890" end="00:11:10.920" style="s2">my internal experience was as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.480" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">speaking going yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.920" end="00:11:16.260" style="s2">definitely the way it ought to be and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:17.340" style="s2">also as my mind tries to reach up I kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.260" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">of get ahead of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.340" end="00:11:21.450" style="s2">my mind is noticing that I couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:22.650" style="s2">that like I know that is way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.450" end="00:11:24.330" style="s2">above my paygrade</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.650" end="00:11:28.500" style="s2">so I can actually look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.330" end="00:11:29.910" style="s2">acknowledge okay yes good those are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:32.730" style="s2">old rightness that right right right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.910" end="00:11:34.380" style="s2">right right and hallelujah</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.730" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody who understands how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.380" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">do that is in the process of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.660" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s really like I haven&#39;t got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.400" end="00:11:43.890" style="s2">good metaphor for it cuz I guess this</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">kind of thing doesn&#39;t happen very often</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.890" end="00:11:48.180" style="s2">but it feels like a collaboration am I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:50.550" style="s2">feeling in the context of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:12:06.510" style="s2">is a lot of feels very good like good</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.550" end="00:12:10.860" style="s2">things are happening so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.510" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">people that are there&#39;s a network right</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.860" end="00:12:16.260" style="s2">and then that network is networked with</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">a growing community right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.260" end="00:12:20.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a Sangha that&#39;s forming around</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:23.610" style="s2">the course but there&#39;s a discord server</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.520" end="00:12:29.850" style="s2">community that&#39;s also forming around all</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.610" end="00:12:34.640" style="s2">those and so it&#39;s it&#39;s very much I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.850" end="00:12:37.110" style="s2">been I&#39;ve been encouraged on how how</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.640" end="00:12:40.290" style="s2">it&#39;s almost autopoietic its its self</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.110" end="00:12:42.600" style="s2">generating in the way it seems to be not</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.290" end="00:12:44.790" style="s2">just not just the traditional permeation</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.600" end="00:12:46.589" style="s2">of ideas but it&#39;s almost like the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.790" end="00:12:49.140" style="s2">you know crystals are forming if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.589" end="00:12:51.960" style="s2">precipitation right of networks that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.140" end="00:12:53.780" style="s2">that&#39;s occurring so you get sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.960" end="00:12:56.640" style="s2">interesting dynamic between a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.780" end="00:12:58.950" style="s2">precipitation on a network and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.640" end="00:13:01.170" style="s2">people participated so the Pacific like</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.950" end="00:13:05.570" style="s2">this Pacific precipitation participation</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.170" end="00:13:05.570" style="s2">cycle that&#39;s actually spinning</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.740" end="00:13:16.080" style="s2">thank you I&#39;m observing it happen wow</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.650" end="00:13:17.640" style="s2">that&#39;s really really interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:18.990" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting that you use that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.640" end="00:13:21.470" style="s2">particular metaphor because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.990" end="00:13:24.600" style="s2">metaphor that I&#39;ve used often myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.470" end="00:13:26.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what it should look like it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.600" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">should look like particularly the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.840" end="00:13:32.370" style="s2">formation of the men way that I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:35.970" style="s2">the metaphor is the formation of ice on</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.370" end="00:13:39.330" style="s2">the surface of a pond where there are in</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.970" end="00:13:41.880" style="s2">fact almost certainly some n of of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.330" end="00:13:44.790" style="s2">crystal matrices that are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.880" end="00:13:47.130" style="s2">forming that we don&#39;t know about and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">each each crystal seed crystal is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.130" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">generating a zone around it which</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:53.550" style="s2">increases the possibility of water</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:56.190" style="s2">spontaneously passing through the phase</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.550" end="00:13:58.470" style="s2">transition into ice which increases the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.190" end="00:13:59.820" style="s2">the surface area of that or the volume</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.470" end="00:14:01.590" style="s2">but really the surface area of that zone</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.820" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">but what happens it becomes extremely</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.590" end="00:14:05.610" style="s2">powerful is when one of those crystal</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:07.530" style="s2">matrices comes close to the zone of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.610" end="00:14:09.870" style="s2">possibility of another crystal matrix</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.530" end="00:14:11.460" style="s2">and then in fact you get this big chunk</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.870" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">like a big up level and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.460" end="00:14:15.540" style="s2">may say that&#39;s actually what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.380" end="00:14:18.150" style="s2">happening between us I think up until</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.540" end="00:14:19.620" style="s2">what a year ago I didn&#39;t I had no exist</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.150" end="00:14:22.170" style="s2">you notice and even existed in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.620" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">and I presume vice versa and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.170" end="00:14:26.070" style="s2">something happened where you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:28.650" style="s2">your thing I was doing my thing our</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.070" end="00:14:31.170" style="s2">things are clearly participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.650" end="00:14:32.490" style="s2">same fundamental thing in very different</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.170" end="00:14:34.500" style="s2">ways and there was a way for us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.490" end="00:14:36.390" style="s2">rapidly be aware of that fact leap</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.500" end="00:14:38.270" style="s2">rapidly into collaboration with a high</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.390" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">degree of vulnerability in transparency</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.270" end="00:14:43.950" style="s2">and then and then you know something</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:46.350" style="s2">much bigger happened like a significant</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.950" end="00:14:48.780" style="s2">increase in possibility and capacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.350" end="00:14:50.790" style="s2">opened up and that&#39;s what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.780" end="00:14:52.620" style="s2">biggest hope happens is that that set of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.790" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">basic characteristics of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.620" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">discern when somebody is how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.200" end="00:15:01.560" style="s2">recognize you call this I call this the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:03.780" style="s2">the invisible conspiracy meaning if</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.560" end="00:15:06.120" style="s2">you&#39;re if we&#39;re both working for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.780" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">same we&#39;re both working on trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.120" end="00:15:11.670" style="s2">make bring the same thing into the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">the fact that we don&#39;t know each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.670" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">makes it even more powerful conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:17.650" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:20.740" style="s2">my whole life I was secretly</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.650" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">collaborating with you but does it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.740" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">matter right I am and and you have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.020" end="00:15:26.740" style="s2">as well as far as I can tell right we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:29.260" style="s2">were clearly oriented towards a fully</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.740" end="00:15:31.390" style="s2">aligned sensibility of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.260" end="00:15:35.110" style="s2">things of what rightness looks and feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.390" end="00:15:36.100" style="s2">like and therefore the possibility than</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.110" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">to bring those pieces together is very</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.100" end="00:15:40.510" style="s2">high so let me drop it another piece so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:42.070" style="s2">the short answer is yes it feels good</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.510" end="00:15:46.210" style="s2">one of the things that I noticed is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.070" end="00:15:49.690" style="s2">were talking is to say okay it is really</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.210" end="00:15:51.820" style="s2">the case that only a certain subset of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.690" end="00:15:55.420" style="s2">the human population right now is going</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.820" end="00:15:57.280" style="s2">to be able to participate in the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.420" end="00:15:58.540" style="s2">psycho technologies and particularly to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.280" end="00:16:01.180" style="s2">collaborate in the meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.540" end="00:16:05.260" style="s2">technology space that&#39;s being developed</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.180" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">and how do I say this the right word the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.260" end="00:16:09.190" style="s2">right way to respond to that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:11.560" style="s2">to take a look at it as a problem to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.190" end="00:16:13.960" style="s2">solved right not the kind of thing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.560" end="00:16:17.320" style="s2">fit to be it chagrined about okay great</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.960" end="00:16:20.080" style="s2">there&#39;s some people who can participate</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.320" end="00:16:23.410" style="s2">in this they should and we need to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.080" end="00:16:25.930" style="s2">a way to empower them to do so those who</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.410" end="00:16:29.290" style="s2">are not yet able to we need to look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.930" end="00:16:33.430" style="s2">the zone of adjacent possibility which</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.290" end="00:16:35.500" style="s2">say who could be brought into that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.430" end="00:16:37.150" style="s2">ideally the most easily you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.500" end="00:16:38.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t we can&#39;t lift a heavy load like</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.150" end="00:16:42.150" style="s2">we have to every step needs to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.440" end="00:16:46.680" style="s2">most elegant step that we can take and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.150" end="00:16:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of three basic constraints</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.680" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">one constraint is the constraint of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.840" end="00:16:55.630" style="s2">individual so does the individual have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:58.330" style="s2">you know a cognitive bias do they have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.630" end="00:16:59.620" style="s2">trauma do they have bad habits and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.330" end="00:17:01.660" style="s2">is our zone of it was just call it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.620" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">healing or wholeness you know so there</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.660" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">may be certain individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:05.950" style="s2">proximal to being able to really get</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:09.070" style="s2">involved in this but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.950" end="00:17:10.900" style="s2">in their developmental arc and and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.070" end="00:17:12.970" style="s2">that might be able to be solved there</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.900" end="00:17:14.380" style="s2">may be a way of producing a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.970" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">to that and many of the practices you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:18.940" style="s2">talked about are practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">healing practices in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.940" end="00:17:22.540" style="s2">sense right so that creates a great</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:24.430" style="s2">on-ramp for people of that sort and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.540" end="00:17:25.720" style="s2">and if and if and if the magnitude is</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.430" end="00:17:27.000" style="s2">large then we can deal with that just</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.720" end="00:17:30.250" style="s2">means that they&#39;re further away in time</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.000" end="00:17:31.540" style="s2">as the zone of capacity increases</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.250" end="00:17:33.870" style="s2">more and more people will be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.540" end="00:17:36.010" style="s2">brought into a capacity to participate</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.870" end="00:17:38.020" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got something in the context</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.010" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">well in context like what&#39;s their actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.020" end="00:17:43.540" style="s2">context so you may have people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:45.160" style="s2">plausibly able to participate but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.540" end="00:17:47.980" style="s2">got to work real hard to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.160" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">ends meet or their social context has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.980" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">lot of energy like challenge chatter to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">it so they&#39;re being pulled back by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.700" end="00:17:55.690" style="s2">context that they&#39;re in so this is when</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:56.800" style="s2">one of the things that is part of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.690" end="00:18:01.660" style="s2">thing that I just announced yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:04.120" style="s2">was this idiom project yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.660" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">yeah I am was quite unable to shoot that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.120" end="00:18:10.780" style="s2">darn thing and the intent there is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">say look one of the things we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.780" end="00:18:17.650" style="s2">do is we&#39;ve got to create physical</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:19.480" style="s2">spaces of living this where we can have</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.650" end="00:18:22.270" style="s2">the possibly to basically control the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.480" end="00:18:24.460" style="s2">context and we can move people from from</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.270" end="00:18:26.050" style="s2">contexts that are make it impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.460" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">them to really participate in two</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.050" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">contexts where they can subject of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:31.770" style="s2">course to the fact that when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">that new context they can and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.770" end="00:18:36.100" style="s2">unfortunately there is a strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.740" style="s2">correlation between individual trauma</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">and hard context and there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.740" end="00:18:43.600" style="s2">much we can actually help and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:46.330" style="s2">only so much scheme that can be held but</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.600" end="00:18:47.650" style="s2">nonetheless there are and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.330" end="00:18:50.110" style="s2">personally experienced quite a large</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.650" end="00:18:52.990" style="s2">number of people who if given the space</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.110" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">to be able to participate would make the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.990" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">commitment to do so and then we will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:58.600" style="s2">able to go through the meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:00.580" style="s2">technologies just like the socio</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.600" end="00:19:02.920" style="s2">technology the meta socio technology is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.580" end="00:19:05.410" style="s2">one of these other nodes and Scythian is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.920" end="00:19:07.510" style="s2">this meta socio technology which can</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.410" end="00:19:09.010" style="s2">begin to operate in lockstep right</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.510" end="00:19:12.280" style="s2">remember it&#39;s these things are going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.010" end="00:19:15.730" style="s2">proceed by integrated holes expanding we</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.280" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">can do a lot of work in partial like</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">laying scaffolding we can put</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:19.810" style="s2">scaffolding out there but then what has</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">to happen there needs to be an</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.810" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">embodiment of a whole triadic wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:31.240" style="s2">and then that that creates real</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">expansion of capacity so what was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.240" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">third one I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.690" end="00:19:46.929" style="s2">the connection between sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.899" end="00:19:49.659" style="s2">ecology of practices the medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.929" end="00:19:52.210" style="s2">the meta second technology and the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.659" end="00:19:53.860" style="s2">in which that needs to be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.210" end="00:19:56.130" style="s2">the city oh I think it might be good at</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.860" end="00:19:58.509" style="s2">some point you know just give a quick</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.130" end="00:20:01.029" style="s2">you know the basic argument of the city</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.509" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">and right here I think would be but</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.029" end="00:20:05.529" style="s2">another thing is because we had a third</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.960" style="s2">thing that we were talking about about</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.529" end="00:20:11.519" style="s2">how to try and bring about you know</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.769" end="00:20:33.000" style="s2">as you said it was like a game maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.909" end="00:20:35.230" style="s2">that&#39;s what drops in and that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:51.879" style="s2">it&#39;s the whole set of would be called</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.919" end="00:20:58.899" style="s2">prosthetics really conversation went</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.879" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">through like they could try and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.899" end="00:21:05.049" style="s2">in gender and cultivate the Ilocos your</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:08.830" style="s2">response which was very spontaneous and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.049" end="00:21:10.629" style="s2">it mentioned a minute way it had served</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.830" end="00:21:12.429" style="s2">as weird effect on me but you said you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.629" end="00:21:13.870" style="s2">said that&#39;s what that&#39;s what church</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.429" end="00:21:16.539" style="s2">should be like what good church should</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.870" end="00:21:18.070" style="s2">be like and I thought ah so yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.539" end="00:21:20.350" style="s2">a connection here to the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.070" end="00:21:21.730" style="s2">not a religion and the rice one reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.350" end="00:21:23.379" style="s2">why that had a personal thing for me is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.730" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">my own relationship to church is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.379" end="00:21:27.399" style="s2">deeply ambivalent one because I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:30.549" style="s2">brought up in a form of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.399" end="00:21:32.169" style="s2">that was quite traumatizing but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.549" end="00:21:33.820" style="s2">understood the intent of what you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.169" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">trying to get out of it so that&#39;s why to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.820" end="00:21:40.450" style="s2">my mind to read the me see here is okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">how do we get something that can you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.450" end="00:21:46.210" style="s2">know transform the way we think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:47.710" style="s2">Education and the way we think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.210" end="00:21:49.539" style="s2">enculturation because we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.710" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">needing to really so those back together</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.539" end="00:21:53.350" style="s2">again yeah that back is making Zach</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:55.390" style="s2">Stein is making axe</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.350" end="00:21:57.400" style="s2">arguments and doing excellent work on</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.390" end="00:22:01.809" style="s2">that project and we&#39;ve talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.400" end="00:22:03.789" style="s2">we we need the comprehensiveness of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.809" end="00:22:05.710" style="s2">religion can do but we need to break out</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.789" end="00:22:07.179" style="s2">of you know the cultural column</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.710" end="00:22:09.669" style="s2">cognitive grammar than the axial</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.179" end="00:22:10.900" style="s2">revolution I gave up because that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.669" end="00:22:13.539" style="s2">longer appropriate for this new</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.900" end="00:22:14.770" style="s2">revolution and I&#39;ve been sort of doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.539" end="00:22:17.830" style="s2">this isn&#39;t so good to people because</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.770" end="00:22:19.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve been saying we need something much</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.830" end="00:22:20.830" style="s2">more deep but we need something deeper I</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.299" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want the French Revolution I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.830" end="00:22:26.340" style="s2">something like the axial revolution yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:26.340" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.380" end="00:22:30.789" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a way of all trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:33.070" style="s2">draw it together and say and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.789" end="00:22:34.630" style="s2">seen these three things talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.070" end="00:22:36.940" style="s2">other or needing to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.630" end="00:22:38.140" style="s2">more Presidium which perhaps you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.940" end="00:22:40.450" style="s2">look as they just give a brief synopsis</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.140" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">this whole idea of the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:46.419" style="s2">practices and the - like the technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:48.730" style="s2">and religion because they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.419" end="00:22:51.820" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to draw into each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.730" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">and mutually afford each other yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.820" end="00:22:54.190" style="s2">I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.570" end="00:22:55.630" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know you know this the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.190" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">my brain works is kind of odd but I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.630" end="00:23:02.140" style="s2">just seeing like a nine dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:04.270" style="s2">hyper object which needed the three</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.140" end="00:23:07.809" style="s2">points and the way they relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.270" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">other as having the stability they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.809" end="00:23:11.500" style="s2">looking for so let me just do a quickie</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.780" style="s2">on on the notion of Cydia because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.500" end="00:23:18.909" style="s2">context you provided makes it relatively</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.780" end="00:23:20.380" style="s2">simple simple so human beings have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.909" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">whole set of needs it&#39;s kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.380" end="00:23:23.830" style="s2">simple as that and we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:26.970" style="s2">a way to meet those needs and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.830" end="00:23:29.830" style="s2">meet those needs in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.970" end="00:23:32.500" style="s2">sustainable in the context of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.830" end="00:23:34.030" style="s2">we can&#39;t you know eat all the food and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.500" end="00:23:36.150" style="s2">then have no food so we have type of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.030" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">way of regenerative production of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.150" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">satisfying our needs and we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2">a way of meeting those needs that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:47.320" style="s2">sustainable in the context of human</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:51.809" style="s2">relationships and so you know massive</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.320" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">wealth in instability and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.809" end="00:23:57.850" style="s2">asymmetry is unstable so the the set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">the ways we go about satisfying our</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.850" end="00:24:04.990" style="s2">needs as humans is the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:07.130" style="s2">obsidium and to put it more practically</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.990" end="00:24:09.170" style="s2">the subject of CBM is things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.130" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">we just live our embodied daily lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:14.060" style="s2">you know how do we get food how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">put a roof over our heads how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.060" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">our vocation of working and giving our</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:19.010" style="s2">gifts back into the world how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:21.410" style="s2">raise our kids how do we have friends</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.010" end="00:24:22.550" style="s2">like all the stuff of human and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.410" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">thing that happens from the gnomon</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.550" end="00:24:24.710" style="s2">you&#39;re born to the moment you die that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:30.650" style="s2">you&#39;d like to have it be as meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.710" end="00:24:33.920" style="s2">and rich as possible in physical bodies</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.650" end="00:24:35.810" style="s2">and it starts at a very theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.920" end="00:24:38.540" style="s2">level which I can just reference to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.810" end="00:24:40.790" style="s2">18 or 19 minute video as I said of one</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.540" end="00:24:42.260" style="s2">of the theoretical pieces behind it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.790" end="00:24:44.090" style="s2">say okay we need to be thoughtful about</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.260" end="00:24:46.070" style="s2">this this is a this is a turns out a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.090" end="00:24:48.590" style="s2">core problem so the underlying design</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.070" end="00:24:50.810" style="s2">with the domain is called ontological</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.590" end="00:24:53.150" style="s2">design the Endermen underlying</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.810" end="00:24:55.790" style="s2">ontological design toolkit that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.150" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">been using is a much apart as much a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.790" end="00:25:01.550" style="s2">part of the problem as other deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:03.620" style="s2">toolkits so we need to do we do that at</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.550" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">the bottom level that work has now been</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.620" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">thought through at some level and now</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:07.610" style="s2">the process is okay how to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.110" style="s2">instantiate that but when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.610" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">instantiate it when you look at a given</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.110" end="00:25:11.920" style="s2">City M you&#39;ll be looking at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">ordinary stuff like okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.920" end="00:25:17.780" style="s2">produce and disseminate distribute food</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:20.030" style="s2">how do we make sure everybody has Forks</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.780" end="00:25:21.710" style="s2">and toilet paper and all the economy all</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.030" end="00:25:22.910" style="s2">that cool stuff again just lives in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.710" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">notion of what I would just call</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.910" end="00:25:29.780" style="s2">socio-technical and by the way in a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:32.120" style="s2">that is able to be very very very human</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.780" end="00:25:35.240" style="s2">at human scale like maximum peg</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.120" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">nurturing at the human scale yet also</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.240" end="00:25:39.730" style="s2">simultaneously global alright so you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.820" end="00:25:42.890" style="s2">actually have a global coherence so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.730" end="00:25:46.100" style="s2">individuals any given location in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.890" end="00:25:47.420" style="s2">city and mesh have a capacity to be in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.100" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">relationship with individuals than any</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.420" end="00:25:51.050" style="s2">other given relationship called a right</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:54.800" style="s2">relationship with any other point in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.050" end="00:25:58.550" style="s2">mesh and also of course the entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.800" end="00:26:00.560" style="s2">system is constructed so as to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.550" end="00:26:05.150" style="s2">regenerative relationship with nature so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.560" end="00:26:06.470" style="s2">not only not only reducing or reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.150" end="00:26:08.060" style="s2">extractive dynamic that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.470" end="00:26:09.920" style="s2">dealing with but actually opposite right</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.060" end="00:26:12.980" style="s2">human being playing the role of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.920" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">partner and steward with our lived</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.980" end="00:26:20.200" style="s2">environment so as to of course create a</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:43.059" style="s2">you think that are still usefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.179" end="00:26:44.260" style="s2">obscured we&#39;re talking about like just</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.059" end="00:26:46.299" style="s2">like I thought about the actual</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.260" end="00:26:48.850" style="s2">revolution is creating a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.299" end="00:26:52.179" style="s2">cognitive grammar you&#39;ve thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.850" end="00:26:54.789" style="s2">city as basically a Neolithic invention</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.179" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">that we&#39;re still using and it&#39;s part of</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.980" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">grammar of civilization exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.669" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">until very recently this is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.940" end="00:27:11.950" style="s2">get this wrong it&#39;s your job please but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:14.409" style="s2">the thing about the city is right when</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.950" end="00:27:17.559" style="s2">you bring people together you get that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.409" end="00:27:20.950" style="s2">you get this sort of nonlinear increase</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.559" end="00:27:23.380" style="s2">in creativity innovation you know right</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.950" end="00:27:25.330" style="s2">which is why we like civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.380" end="00:27:27.190" style="s2">the price we pay for that is because</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.330" end="00:27:29.350" style="s2">we&#39;re body you get a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.190" end="00:27:32.279" style="s2">together and a lot of people together is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.350" end="00:27:35.620" style="s2">mental ill-health disease right</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.279" end="00:27:37.179" style="s2">pollution problems you know a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:38.860" style="s2">degradation of the environment because</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.179" end="00:27:42.279" style="s2">you&#39;re concentrating people into a small</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.860" end="00:27:45.100" style="s2">area etc etcetera so right we&#39;re caught</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.279" end="00:27:47.980" style="s2">right it that way and then what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.100" end="00:27:51.659" style="s2">saying is we can actually we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.980" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">to have the city as the kernel of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.659" end="00:27:57.370" style="s2">civilization anymore we can pull those</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:59.889" style="s2">apart as we if we could get this</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.370" end="00:28:01.990" style="s2">technology and the corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.889" end="00:28:04.630" style="s2">cognitive psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.990" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">coordinated we could ramp up the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.630" end="00:28:11.260" style="s2">of minds so we get all of the creativity</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:14.710" style="s2">and meaning in life that civilization</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.260" end="00:28:16.360" style="s2">right in its complexity gives us but on</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.710" end="00:28:19.330" style="s2">the ground if you&#39;ll allow me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.360" end="00:28:21.340" style="s2">metaphor people are living in Dunbar you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.330" end="00:28:23.470" style="s2">know environments that are very close to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.340" end="00:28:26.529" style="s2">the environments in which we evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.470" end="00:28:28.539" style="s2">we as a species that 99.9 percent of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.529" end="00:28:31.379" style="s2">existence and therefore are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.539" end="00:28:33.580" style="s2">conducive to our biological</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.379" end="00:28:35.860" style="s2">psychological and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.580" end="00:28:38.950" style="s2">to health and so people could be living</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.860" end="00:28:41.230" style="s2">really well reaching back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.950" end="00:28:42.970" style="s2">primordial placement like the primordial</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.230" end="00:28:45.100" style="s2">kind of environment we&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.970" end="00:28:47.770" style="s2">living in but still have access to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.100" end="00:28:52.300" style="s2">everything that civilization has</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.770" end="00:28:53.860" style="s2">provided for us yes yeah that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.300" end="00:28:55.780" style="s2">well I would say access to everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.860" end="00:28:58.330" style="s2">civilization has provided for us in</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.780" end="00:29:00.490" style="s2">spades right because the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.330" end="00:29:02.650" style="s2">that once you make this move when really</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.490" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">we really pop this the thing pops out to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.650" end="00:29:09.250" style="s2">a big a big pop is it to reinforce each</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.890" style="s2">other because if we have people living</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.250" end="00:29:13.390" style="s2">as they&#39;ve evolved to live and I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.890" end="00:29:14.950" style="s2">say if they have something like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.390" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion and all</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.950" end="00:29:20.350" style="s2">that stuff there that gives them the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:23.500" style="s2">capacity the cognitive flexibility the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.350" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">biological you know resilience to enter</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.500" end="00:29:28.390" style="s2">in spend more time in hyperspace without</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:30.670" style="s2">being right without being and then of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.390" end="00:29:33.070" style="s2">course in that creativity right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.670" end="00:29:37.000" style="s2">they get the competent kinds of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:38.830" style="s2">from you know that like the Trading</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.000" end="00:29:40.810" style="s2">Networks and the shamans did way back</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.830" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">when you bring in and you can impregnate</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.810" end="00:29:47.880" style="s2">your own group with things from</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:47.880" style="s2">elsewhere in the world yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.570" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">yeah absolutely that&#39;s all of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.250" end="00:29:56.860" style="s2">so what was I so was think it says what</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">I want to do is I want to I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.860" end="00:30:01.210" style="s2">want to kind of put a South in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:03.850" style="s2">any sort of demoralization that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.210" end="00:30:06.250" style="s2">might have in listening to this I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.850" end="00:30:08.920" style="s2">thinking over the past couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.250" end="00:30:10.600" style="s2">maybe five years gosh I&#39;ve had an</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.920" end="00:30:12.340" style="s2">opportunity to interact with a much</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.600" end="00:30:15.670" style="s2">larger group of people in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.340" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">ideas like this you know right right</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.670" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">I&#39;ll write something down and people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:22.900" style="s2">respond I have to admit most of that has</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">been highly demoralizing the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.900" end="00:30:26.020" style="s2">discipline intellectual and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:27.460" style="s2">discipline that most people seem to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.020" end="00:30:32.860" style="s2">apply in the way that they interact with</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">things is sad but other parts of a bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:35.880" style="s2">empowering and saying okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">let&#39;s identify what are the types of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.880" end="00:30:43.420" style="s2">things that end up being blockers so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:45.970" style="s2">I&#39;ll give an example if one endeavors to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.420" end="00:30:46.770" style="s2">put their own mind to solving the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.970" end="00:30:48.600" style="s2">problem that you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.770" end="00:30:50.250" style="s2">laid out the problematic that you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.600" end="00:30:51.570" style="s2">identified as being the design</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.250" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">constraints of what this thing needs to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.570" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">look like and what&#39;s possible if you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:57.020" style="s2">there you will likely run into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.460" style="s2">reality that you don&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.020" end="00:31:00.660" style="s2">and that might feel bad like like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.460" end="00:31:02.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do this I feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.660" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">overwhelmed in the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.310" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">response it&#39;s a task that is vastly</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:07.170" style="s2">larger than not just your capacity but</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:09.450" style="s2">even anything that you could vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.170" end="00:31:11.580" style="s2">imagine being in your any capacity at</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.450" end="00:31:13.050" style="s2">all well then one of the defense</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.580" end="00:31:15.540" style="s2">mechanisms that is typical in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.050" end="00:31:18.120" style="s2">environment is then shutting down to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.540" end="00:31:20.670" style="s2">oh oh project the impossibility of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.120" end="00:31:23.430" style="s2">and then actually just live with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.670" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">dopamine miss right you have a cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.430" end="00:31:30.030" style="s2">response ah and kinda put your head down</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:34.290" style="s2">and move on but what I would suggest is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.030" end="00:31:35.490" style="s2">to say more like a literally just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.290" end="00:31:37.680" style="s2">relationships you and I had just had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.490" end="00:31:38.790" style="s2">moment ago like if I if I listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.680" end="00:31:41.640" style="s2">talking about the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.790" end="00:31:43.740" style="s2">about and I try to like own it I try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.640" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">take responsibility for myself I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.740" end="00:31:47.190" style="s2">get overwhelmed real quick because</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.540" style="s2">you&#39;re really good at what you do you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.190" end="00:31:50.160" style="s2">been doing it your whole life and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.540" end="00:31:51.630" style="s2">nowhere near as good at that and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.160" end="00:31:53.460" style="s2">been doing it nowhere near as long so</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.630" end="00:31:55.080" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s a lot bigger and if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.460" end="00:31:56.310" style="s2">want to try to own it and master it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.080" end="00:31:57.870" style="s2">gonna fail and I&#39;m gonna feel really bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.310" end="00:31:59.310" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.870" end="00:32:01.020" style="s2">but there is a way for me to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.310" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">listen to it and notice in myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.020" end="00:32:04.710" style="s2">something like a yep yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:06.450" style="s2">something about like that&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.710" end="00:32:07.350" style="s2">well like just that like you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.450" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">the difference between somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.350" end="00:32:10.830" style="s2">doing something well and sometimes not</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:13.460" style="s2">doing something well and you could feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.830" end="00:32:16.140" style="s2">yourself like it&#39;s hard to explain but</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.460" end="00:32:18.270" style="s2">the deeper sensibilities that you use to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.140" end="00:32:20.070" style="s2">guide your best work if you tuned into</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:22.200" style="s2">those and you perceive somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.070" end="00:32:23.310" style="s2">who&#39;s doing work you can notice whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.200" end="00:32:24.780" style="s2">or not they&#39;re doing something with</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.310" end="00:32:27.750" style="s2">elegance and artistry and if they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.780" end="00:32:30.690" style="s2">you can have a thank God somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.750" end="00:32:32.130" style="s2">is carrying this piece and we can all</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.690" end="00:32:33.660" style="s2">look at this and say the problem is vast</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.130" end="00:32:35.730" style="s2">well beyond anything that we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.660" end="00:32:37.380" style="s2">do and that&#39;s okay and we&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.730" end="00:32:38.730" style="s2">to solve it all at once we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.380" end="00:32:40.170" style="s2">figure out how to kind of get some sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.730" end="00:32:42.180" style="s2">of the shape of the problem and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.170" end="00:32:43.650" style="s2">what right direction looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.180" end="00:32:45.690" style="s2">feels like and then be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.650" end="00:32:46.920" style="s2">enough steps in in the immediate term</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.690" end="00:32:49.920" style="s2">that the steps that we&#39;re making are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.920" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">guided by that directionality but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.920" end="00:32:53.010" style="s2">gonna be a long time it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.110" style="s2">generations before we get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.010" end="00:32:57.180" style="s2">fully dialed in we&#39;re all everybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.110" end="00:33:00.120" style="s2">who&#39;s currently perceiving this in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.180" end="00:33:00.419" style="s2">most of you will be dead before this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.120" end="00:33:02.700" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.419" end="00:33:04.590" style="s2">actually is is is rendered fruition and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.700" end="00:33:06.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of holding it like our</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.590" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">job is not to build the cathedral our</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.690" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">job is to put a couple of bricks on each</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">other and imagine what a cathedral might</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:24.690" style="s2">look like can I do one more things I</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:26.429" style="s2">just landed and it also goes to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.690" end="00:33:28.470" style="s2">this problematic that identify with you</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.619" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">in the practice if I&#39;m putting one brick</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.539" end="00:33:36.330" style="s2">on top of another and imagine what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:39.239" style="s2">cathedral will look like that I will</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.330" end="00:33:41.249" style="s2">never see is the most meaningful thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.239" end="00:33:43.470" style="s2">that it&#39;s the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.249" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">meaninglessness is the ability to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.470" end="00:33:48.690" style="s2">that context to know that you&#39;re part of</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.370" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not meant to be detrimental so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:32.970" style="s2">was talking with Chris and I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.980" style="s2">to think I would locate what our</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.970" end="00:34:36.420" style="s2">particular issues we might get from we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.980" end="00:34:39.630" style="s2">talked with you and I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.420" end="00:34:42.150" style="s2">the problem of sort of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.630" end="00:34:44.880" style="s2">charismatic leader or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.150" end="00:34:46.290" style="s2">misappropriate this and then another one</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.880" end="00:34:49.260" style="s2">that came up with discussion with Chris</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.290" end="00:34:50.940" style="s2">is you know one of the things that seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.260" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">to require at least for most of us it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.940" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">does for me physical proximity of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:35:06.600" style="s2">sexuality hmm the city gives me this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:09.450" style="s2">not a quarry but it gives me access to</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.600" end="00:35:12.090" style="s2">right I would not have met somebody as</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.450" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">wonderful as the woman I&#39;m with if I did</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.090" end="00:35:17.580" style="s2">not have such a large population that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:20.190" style="s2">so diversified so stratified division of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.580" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">labor I would not have met her right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.190" end="00:35:25.980" style="s2">now if I need somebody like that because</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:28.350" style="s2">of my access to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.980" end="00:35:29.400" style="s2">Internet the hydrosphere the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.350" end="00:35:31.860" style="s2">I&#39;m going to fall in love with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.400" end="00:35:34.020" style="s2">who might be living in China uh-huh and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.860" end="00:35:36.690" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.020" end="00:35:38.520" style="s2">problematic it&#39;s gonna cause frustration</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.690" end="00:35:39.870" style="s2">oh man let&#39;s do this the students this</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.520" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">is great and this is perfect like when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.870" end="00:35:44.760" style="s2">said living this great mate selection is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:47.910" style="s2">pretty close to the whole point right</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.760" end="00:35:50.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the very bottom all right but</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.910" end="00:35:54.930" style="s2">this is a suitors contextualize because</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.760" end="00:35:56.940" style="s2">here we sit at the the unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.930" end="00:35:59.790" style="s2">discovery that the sexual revolution was</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.940" end="00:36:01.500" style="s2">not all free love and happiness in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.790" end="00:36:05.130" style="s2">context of online dating is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.500" end="00:36:06.420" style="s2">necessarily awesome I did swiping left I</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.130" end="00:36:07.320" style="s2">don&#39;t have ever used tinder so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.420" end="00:36:09.060" style="s2">know exactly what that mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.320" end="00:36:15.620" style="s2">swiping left on tinder does not lead to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.060" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">an ending joy okay so design constraint</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.620" end="00:36:24.440" style="s2">membership in Sevilla must</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:28.970" style="s2">lead to a felt up gradient in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.440" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">quality of your how would I call this</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.970" end="00:36:33.260" style="s2">not sexual but mating or pair bonding</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.630" end="00:36:39.250" style="s2">that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.260" end="00:36:41.990" style="s2">your pair bonding relationality and must</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.250" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">provide an ongoing up gradient in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.990" end="00:36:47.060" style="s2">particular domain that is stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.890" style="s2">any other possible choice yes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.060" end="00:36:50.600" style="s2">that&#39;s by the way this is sort of how I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:52.760" style="s2">do this thing I think about can I design</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.600" end="00:36:54.550" style="s2">this kind of design the thing at an</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.760" end="00:36:57.140" style="s2">abstraction level that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.550" end="00:36:58.520" style="s2">necessary insufficient and then can we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.140" end="00:36:59.840" style="s2">begin to work backwards to say okay how</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.520" end="00:37:01.700" style="s2">do we accomplish that and and if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.840" end="00:37:02.750" style="s2">can&#39;t accomplish it perfectly we know</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.700" end="00:37:03.740" style="s2">what the mountain looks like at the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.750" end="00:37:05.060" style="s2">and we can start think about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.740" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">actually start taking steps towards it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.060" end="00:37:09.020" style="s2">so one of the things that I noticed in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:12.860" style="s2">the contemporary context it&#39;s funny and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.020" end="00:37:14.750" style="s2">I&#39;m 50 so I I i and I and I&#39;ve had like</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.860" end="00:37:17.780" style="s2">two real significant pair bonding</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.750" end="00:37:19.550" style="s2">relationships that have lasted long</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.780" end="00:37:20.840" style="s2">periods of time so I don&#39;t have any real</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.550" end="00:37:22.280" style="s2">connection with the Millennial or</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.840" end="00:37:24.290" style="s2">certainly the Jen&#39;s II experience of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.280" end="00:37:25.820" style="s2">dating but at this entire thing called I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.290" end="00:37:27.170" style="s2">guess the pickup artist like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.820" end="00:37:28.820" style="s2">invention of that and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.170" end="00:37:30.620" style="s2">invented it developed it became a whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.820" end="00:37:32.210" style="s2">thing and that is already in a different</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.620" end="00:37:34.490" style="s2">stage of development I think it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.210" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">telling which is to say that an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.490" end="00:37:40.100" style="s2">of the meaning crisis is that we suck at</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">pair-bond and we&#39;ve kind of optimized</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.100" end="00:37:45.290" style="s2">for hookups like I guess it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:49.100" style="s2">even called hookup culture so in a large</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.290" end="00:37:53.090" style="s2">urban area you have a very high target</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.100" end="00:37:55.130" style="s2">rich environment for hookups but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.090" end="00:37:59.810" style="s2">seems that we do a very poor job of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:38:01.550" style="s2">having meaningful relationships and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.810" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">need to be doing a particularly poor job</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.550" end="00:38:05.560" style="s2">in having the kind of meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">relationships that can actually lead to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.560" end="00:38:11.960" style="s2">pair bonding like parenting families and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">let&#39;s be very clear while it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:15.590" style="s2">perfectly good and valid for people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">have pair bonding relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.590" end="00:38:20.540" style="s2">don&#39;t lead to children a sizeable</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:24.050" style="s2">fraction must otherwise the culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.540" end="00:38:26.030" style="s2">terminates and by the way we could just</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.050" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">you know there&#39;s pair bonding over here</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:29.060" style="s2">and there&#39;s also family and child</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:30.470" style="s2">rearing over here and everything that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.060" end="00:38:32.510" style="s2">just said about pair bonding is also</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.470" end="00:38:33.829" style="s2">true of child rearing even more so right</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.510" end="00:38:36.469" style="s2">this must be</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.829" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">Cydia must be a context that is so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.469" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">better than anything else that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:42.559" style="s2">there in terms of raising children both</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:44.049" style="s2">from the point of parenting and from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.559" end="00:38:46.130" style="s2">point of view being the actual child</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.049" end="00:38:47.900" style="s2">like that&#39;s like the center of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.130" end="00:38:52.519" style="s2">everything that&#39;s that&#39;s like the ground</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.900" end="00:38:54.289" style="s2">zero is that okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.519" end="00:38:56.089" style="s2">so what does that sort of thing look</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.289" end="00:38:57.709" style="s2">like so as we&#39;ve discovered we have on</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.089" end="00:38:59.509" style="s2">the one hand in the virtual environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.709" end="00:39:00.529" style="s2">I will be an impossibility to begin</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.509" end="00:39:02.930" style="s2">relationship with everybody on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.529" end="00:39:04.819" style="s2">planet this has advantages that my</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.930" end="00:39:06.829" style="s2">target rich environment for interactions</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.819" end="00:39:08.869" style="s2">and relation ality has gone way up it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.829" end="00:39:10.099" style="s2">has the disadvantage that I may fall in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.869" end="00:39:12.950" style="s2">love with somebody who&#39;s on the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.099" end="00:39:14.930" style="s2">side of the world that&#39;s gonna make for</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.950" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">a lot of poetry that&#39;s gonna make for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.930" end="00:39:20.150" style="s2">lot of Abelard and Eloise style romantic</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;ll be powerful rich and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.150" end="00:39:24.729" style="s2">heart-rending for sure and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:27.319" style="s2">by the way it seems quite likely that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.729" end="00:39:28.339" style="s2">frequent transnational travel will</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.319" end="00:39:43.309" style="s2">actually go down</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.339" end="00:39:45.469" style="s2">that&#39;s my guest most of human history we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.309" end="00:39:47.989" style="s2">have been brought up in an aberrant</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.469" end="00:39:50.779" style="s2">point in history that is probably coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.989" end="00:39:52.489" style="s2">to an end yeah and one of the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.779" end="00:39:55.099" style="s2">of CBM is it provides sort of a natural</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.489" end="00:39:58.059" style="s2">structural design defense against</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.099" end="00:40:01.069" style="s2">pandemic yeah but because of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.059" end="00:40:03.289" style="s2">because of the always background threat</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.069" end="00:40:06.289" style="s2">of pandemic yeah transnational travel is</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.289" end="00:40:10.219" style="s2">so there&#39;s gonna be something like a</p>

<p begin="00:40:10.219" end="00:40:18.199" style="s2">look at me if you look at the literature</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.979" end="00:40:21.410" style="s2">on on pair-bonding that the reality is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.199" end="00:40:25.279" style="s2">is that long term successful</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.410" end="00:40:28.789" style="s2">relationships tend to be within a very</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.789" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">heterogeneity not too close and not too</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.900" end="00:40:37.299" style="s2">far and that makes sense right because</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:39.380" style="s2">you and I both been through</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.329" end="00:40:47.510" style="s2">hard right this whole thing of being in</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:09.620" style="s2">know in the past up until the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.830" end="00:41:11.480" style="s2">the 20th century for the most part we</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.620" end="00:41:15.320" style="s2">had the advantage and a disadvantage of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.480" end="00:41:17.990" style="s2">running traditional cultural code so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.320" end="00:41:20.270" style="s2">example my wife is Croatian and I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.990" end="00:41:21.860" style="s2">had and the Croatian culture even like</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.270" end="00:41:23.780" style="s2">the expectation culture is still running</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.860" end="00:41:25.790" style="s2">traditional cultural code for the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.780" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">part it&#39;s beginning to break apart as it</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.790" end="00:41:29.480" style="s2">always will and it moves into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:31.610" style="s2">cosmopolitan space like the United</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.480" end="00:41:32.570" style="s2">States but you can you can receive it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.610" end="00:41:34.940" style="s2">you can see how there was like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.570" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2">religion that had a whole bunch of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.940" end="00:41:40.220" style="s2">it you went through all the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:41.900" style="s2">moments and if you sort of took the sum</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.220" end="00:41:44.270" style="s2">total of the community you took all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:46.670" style="s2">Catholic moments and that was more or</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.270" end="00:41:48.380" style="s2">less your whole social time so if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.670" end="00:41:51.650" style="s2">weren&#39;t going to a wedding you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.380" end="00:41:56.180" style="s2">to a confirmation so I don&#39;t know my</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.650" end="00:41:59.450" style="s2">Catholic Zachary pardon catechism right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.180" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">and that combined with a couple of sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.450" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">of more secular events like a big pig</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:05.810" style="s2">roast or a soccer game like that was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">social life and that was a faint fabric</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.810" end="00:42:08.810" style="s2">and a framework that did things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:11.000" style="s2">introduce you to also possible other</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.810" end="00:42:13.400" style="s2">mating partners and make it very simple</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.000" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">to know a how to go from possible mating</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.400" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">partners into being married then</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">actually held you in a context that made</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">it you know adequate context to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:22.430" style="s2">marriage together long enough and stable</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">enough to produce children so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.430" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2">culture could reproduce all right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:29.390" style="s2">every traditional culture is that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.390" end="00:42:31.370" style="s2">would say minimum viable boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.390" end="00:42:33.860" style="s2">condition to satisfy that set of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.370" end="00:42:35.420" style="s2">characteristics so we&#39;re an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.860" end="00:42:42.730" style="s2">situation where on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.420" end="00:42:42.730" style="s2">explosion of post-war neoliberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.090" end="00:42:48.460" style="s2">post-modernism and capitalism has has</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.310" end="00:42:50.930" style="s2">has and this critique is correct has</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.460" end="00:42:53.000" style="s2">shattered many of those around the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.930" end="00:42:56.420" style="s2">and a big piece of the meaning crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.000" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">precisely that people thrown into out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.420" end="00:43:00.710" style="s2">a cultural context that made their life</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.339" style="s2">held into having to figure it out for</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.710" end="00:43:03.349" style="s2">themselves which</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.339" end="00:43:04.489" style="s2">can&#39;t do human beings are no ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.349" end="00:43:06.680" style="s2">capable of figuring out for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.489" end="00:43:08.900" style="s2">and so we do an increasingly shitty job</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:10.849" style="s2">of it we have the advantage that we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.900" end="00:43:12.529" style="s2">no longer constrained by the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.849" end="00:43:14.900" style="s2">culture that we used to be in which has</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.529" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">all kinds of salience in particular like</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.900" end="00:43:19.700" style="s2">I can definitely have a lot of salience</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.650" style="s2">landscaping and get get laid and take</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.700" end="00:43:22.759" style="s2">drugs and all kinds of cool art and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.650" end="00:43:25.299" style="s2">know the bohemian lifestyle is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.759" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">attractive and in lots of positive ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.299" end="00:43:29.930" style="s2">but so I&#39;m liberated from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:31.729" style="s2">constraints but I&#39;m also liberated from</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.930" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">the constraints which means I have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.729" end="00:43:34.519" style="s2">take responsibility something I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:36.619" style="s2">take responsibility for it and become</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.519" end="00:43:39.380" style="s2">increasingly sad and you know I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.619" end="00:43:41.749" style="s2">in just far enough down the immigrant</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.380" end="00:43:44.180" style="s2">cycle that I was had almost no</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.749" end="00:43:46.579" style="s2">traditional construct so I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.180" end="00:43:49.339" style="s2">the suburbs and I then raised kids in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.579" end="00:43:52.219" style="s2">the suburbs and I noticed like the PAL</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.339" end="00:43:55.460" style="s2">city of our traditions like Halloween</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.219" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">like how did you do Halloween and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.460" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">notion of like in California in</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:01.009" style="s2">particular where most of the people were</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:02.509" style="s2">immigrants to California didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.009" end="00:44:05.329" style="s2">grew up in California at Oakland is Lee</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.509" end="00:44:08.119" style="s2">and most were actually second or third</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.329" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">generation Serban suburban nights</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.119" end="00:44:15.859" style="s2">so this very very thin gruel of culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s like it&#39;s coughing sputtering</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.859" end="00:44:18.739" style="s2">engine that&#39;s right kind of reached the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:19.160" style="s2">end of its capacity to hold things</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.739" end="00:44:21.499" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.160" end="00:44:24.259" style="s2">okay so sorry that&#39;s that&#39;s like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.499" end="00:44:26.779" style="s2">context of where we are so the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.259" end="00:44:30.229" style="s2">is to say okay traditionally if you had</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.779" end="00:44:33.019" style="s2">on the order of like 15 to 150,000</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.229" end="00:44:36.999" style="s2">potential mates or potential people that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.019" end="00:44:40.369" style="s2">mates with potential people in reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.999" end="00:44:42.049" style="s2">think about just the sheer math there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.369" end="00:44:44.329" style="s2">a boundary condition of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.049" end="00:44:46.759" style="s2">people who are you know even</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.329" end="00:44:49.819" style="s2">theoretically potential mates you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.759" end="00:44:51.170" style="s2">interact with . and there&#39;s an even</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.819" end="00:44:53.269" style="s2">narrower boundary of those you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.170" end="00:44:55.519" style="s2">explore the possibility of courtship and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.269" end="00:44:56.269" style="s2">of course a much much smaller number</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.519" end="00:44:58.670" style="s2">that you could actually really</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.269" end="00:45:00.650" style="s2">meaningfully experiment with it so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.670" end="00:45:03.289" style="s2">you get outside of that boundary</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.650" end="00:45:06.049" style="s2">condition of the first order anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.289" end="00:45:07.759" style="s2">larger than that is waste it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.049" end="00:45:09.289" style="s2">useful now we&#39;d like to do is we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.759" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">to actually have the interior of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.289" end="00:45:14.940" style="s2">bad just let&#39;s say by hypothesis an</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:17.339" style="s2">average human could kind of me</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.940" end="00:45:21.000" style="s2">we explore the possibility of courtship</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.339" end="00:45:23.250" style="s2">would say 10,000 people and just like</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.000" end="00:45:25.109" style="s2">literally just in interactions in social</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.250" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2">environments encountering people like no</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.109" end="00:45:30.119" style="s2">no yes possibly no oh wow amazing right</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:31.800" style="s2">men okay well you&#39;d like to do just like</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.119" end="00:45:33.900" style="s2">to have that 10,000 be really really</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.800" end="00:45:35.069" style="s2">high-quality that&#39;s what you want you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.900" end="00:45:37.589" style="s2">want to have the number the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.069" end="00:45:41.480" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with are are healthy</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.839" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">you want the end to be high enough that</p>
