<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">learning a little bit but first of all</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">any in any time you want to flip the</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">things that I&#39;m starting to think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:58.070" style="s2">is doing a little bit of retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">work trying to think about where our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.070" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">world our country is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">another electoral cycle and I just think</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">this is the most bizarre age imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t behave like any previous time</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:16.060" style="s2">and I hear that we&#39;re at peak this and P</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:18.790" style="s2">that but I don&#39;t see any signs of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.060" end="00:02:21.970" style="s2">what I increasingly see is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.790" end="00:02:23.950" style="s2">incoherence slowing down are you also</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.970" end="00:02:25.870" style="s2">perceiving a world that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.950" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">intellectually unraveling or are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.870" end="00:02:31.890" style="s2">seeing new kinds of formations that give</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">you the idea that something is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.890" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">filling the voids that have been opening</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">up when it comes to coherence well well</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:41.319" style="s2">I I worried that this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.750" style="s2">cognitive delusion that the to think of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.319" end="00:02:49.090" style="s2">the time you&#39;re in is always sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.750" end="00:02:51.250" style="s2">newly chaotic or incoherent or you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.090" end="00:02:54.310" style="s2">the civilizations on the brink in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.250" end="00:02:56.260" style="s2">new way in your time but I but I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.310" end="00:02:57.850" style="s2">taken in by it you know you gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.260" end="00:03:00.220" style="s2">kidding me yeah this this has never</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.850" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">happened no no I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.220" end="00:03:03.700" style="s2">that but there&#39;s got to be some name for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">this where it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.700" end="00:03:08.470" style="s2">a some kind of recency effect or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:10.780" style="s2">clearly there have been periods in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.470" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">history where things really have been on</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.780" end="00:03:14.530" style="s2">the brink and in some new way oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">mean to suggest that like this is the I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.530" end="00:03:18.130" style="s2">mean in general no no I don&#39;t mean like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:19.239" style="s2">world war two is about to happen you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.130" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">know World War three is about haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.239" end="00:03:27.970" style="s2">but the I do feel like we are witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:30.519" style="s2">several sea changes which you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.970" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have honestly said that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.519" end="00:03:33.190" style="s2">know 15 years ago over 20 years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:37.630" style="s2">mean something you know something has</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.190" end="00:03:39.340" style="s2">changed and it&#39;s some things have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.630" end="00:03:41.530" style="s2">clearly changed change for the worse and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.340" end="00:03:44.139" style="s2">maybe maybe there&#39;s a silver lining to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.530" end="00:03:46.269" style="s2">this chaos but I would be hard-pressed</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.139" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">to find it at the moment well so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.269" end="00:03:50.260" style="s2">I&#39;m started thinking about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:53.019" style="s2">chaos were we&#39;re in and using the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.260" end="00:03:55.269" style="s2">that you and I agree on a lot which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.019" end="00:03:57.160" style="s2">think makes our disagreements more</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.269" end="00:04:00.370" style="s2">interesting because I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.160" end="00:04:01.359" style="s2">ground-level he said she said kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.370" end="00:04:03.790" style="s2">disagreements I don&#39;t think they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.359" end="00:04:07.060" style="s2">interesting for me the big thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.790" end="00:04:09.819" style="s2">really new is that I can&#39;t think of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.060" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">single institution I trust there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">place that I can go to for ground truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:15.850" style="s2">this is an example so that you take the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.230" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">New York Times and you and I whinge</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.850" end="00:04:20.590" style="s2">about the New York Times a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:23.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve been watching you transition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.590" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">oh yeah yeah yeah I&#39;ve grown pretty dark</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.260" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">about the paper that I drew yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:30.860" style="s2">years ago you were somewhere else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">but but I guess I&#39;m wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">the cohort before us 20 years ago had</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:39.270" style="s2">this same litany of complaints about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">New York Times or whether something</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.270" end="00:04:43.410" style="s2">fundamentally has shifted well I I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.660" style="s2">on I&#39;ve been on the New York Times since</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.410" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">the 80s okay so you were early to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.660" end="00:04:50.310" style="s2">part yeah I was very early to this party</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:53.490" style="s2">for nothing has changed so it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.310" end="00:04:55.230" style="s2">this worse than the 80s it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.490" end="00:04:57.030" style="s2">question depends it worse isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">right word in my opinion the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.030" end="00:05:01.590" style="s2">play with it is I&#39;d say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">problem has always been the same which</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.590" end="00:05:07.920" style="s2">is narrative driven journalism and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">first clear indication I have of this I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.920" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">think was a story about Woodstock in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:14.970" style="s2">which the paper told the reporter how</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">old are you you&#39;re not that much older</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.970" end="00:05:25.590" style="s2">than me I was in my diapers no no no I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">don&#39;t remember this as 69 yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.590" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">no it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">I remember reading I will clarify I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">remember reading a story about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">journalists being sent who was sent to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">cover Woodstock by The Times being told</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:44.520" style="s2">right about the filth and the hippies</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:47.220" style="s2">and the unkempt miss and strangely</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.520" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a bias that I now share I at one</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.220" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">point I had a the the I there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:05:56.910" style="s2">point in my life in my in my 20s where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">kind of recapitulated the 60s for myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.910" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">okay and had nothing but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">nostalgia for the 60s that I missed but</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:08.010" style="s2">now I have a fairly Joan Didion look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:11.610" style="s2">you know the the slouching toward</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.010" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">Bethlehem a moment that was it just the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.610" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">level of dysfunction and in the non</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">acknowledgement of dysfunction it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:25.530" style="s2">pretty shocking so but look it declined</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:29.160" style="s2">okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.530" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">the what I recall of the story was is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.160" end="00:06:33.180" style="s2">that The Times had told the reporter</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:35.160" style="s2">what sort of story to file and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.180" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">reporter called up two times and said I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.160" end="00:06:40.169" style="s2">refuse I&#39;m seeing something different</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.530" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing something inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.169" end="00:06:43.889" style="s2">you&#39;re and heart opening and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">going to file that story so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.889" end="00:06:50.189" style="s2">what you wanted and I have cholera and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:52.199" style="s2">I&#39;ve color so I think that the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.189" end="00:06:55.439" style="s2">aspect of the New York Times has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.199" end="00:06:59.490" style="s2">both its structural reason for its</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.439" end="00:07:01.289" style="s2">importance and the fatal flaw that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.490" end="00:07:03.689" style="s2">essence it carries these very long</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.289" end="00:07:06.710" style="s2">narrative arcs that come from the editor</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.689" end="00:07:09.449" style="s2">the editorial function at the Times and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.710" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">that those are written in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.449" end="00:07:13.169" style="s2">before the facts are known and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:14.939" style="s2">facts are then fit to the narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.169" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">then when the counter narratives occur</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.939" end="00:07:19.469" style="s2">the times really either doesn&#39;t report</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">the story as and they really couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.469" end="00:07:22.710" style="s2">handle the the situation that happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.900" style="s2">with my brother because it was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.710" end="00:07:26.969" style="s2">counter narrative more than they distort</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.900" end="00:07:28.500" style="s2">based on the idea that they need to push</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.969" end="00:07:30.330" style="s2">things back into the narrative so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.500" end="00:07:32.370" style="s2">think that has always been present and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.330" end="00:07:33.960" style="s2">there are particular kinds of stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.370" end="00:07:36.050" style="s2">that The Times writes that I find</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:38.669" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.050" end="00:07:41.669" style="s2">now I&#39;ll go so far as to say borderline</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.669" end="00:07:43.979" style="s2">evil and what they do is they crowd out</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.669" end="00:07:47.610" style="s2">whatever natural inquiry process would</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.979" end="00:07:49.439" style="s2">be happening so I&#39;m happy to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.610" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">couple of examples about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.439" end="00:07:54.719" style="s2">would say I think that the problem has</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:07:56.580" style="s2">been there at the New York Times all</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.719" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">along there are some new things that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.580" end="00:08:01.259" style="s2">see as happening there like a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">between the old-line journalists with</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.259" end="00:08:05.939" style="s2">the new line yeah of sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:11.149" style="s2">Brooklyn based writers who are telling</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.939" end="00:08:13.020" style="s2">us they haven&#39;t had to think yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.149" end="00:08:15.180" style="s2">well you make you I don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.020" end="00:08:16.830" style="s2">the time is maybe an exception here but</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.180" end="00:08:18.180" style="s2">I think generally what&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.830" end="00:08:20.759" style="s2">journalism and there&#39;s just been a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.180" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">clearing out of real journalists right I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.759" end="00:08:25.649" style="s2">mean the business has gotten so bad and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:27.240" style="s2">again the times and the post and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.649" end="00:08:29.610" style="s2">Atlantic there&#39;s a few outliers here</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.240" end="00:08:31.800" style="s2">they&#39;re doing well in the age of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.610" end="00:08:33.690" style="s2">at least you know sort of well Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.800" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">saving their business yes yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.690" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">they would actually they weren&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2">great before Trump but now they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:44.910" style="s2">okay but the rest of journalism has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:47.399" style="s2">gutted and now we basically have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.910" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">blogosphere and you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.399" end="00:08:50.670" style="s2">what the Huffington Post did to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">landscape where you just had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.670" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">people blogging for free</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.020" end="00:09:00.190" style="s2">you know propping up a a an ad based</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:02.770" style="s2">clickbait business model sure with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.190" end="00:09:05.710" style="s2">again that the I&#39;d I guess what I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.770" end="00:09:07.810" style="s2">to play with is is there something</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.710" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">special about institutions imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.810" end="00:09:11.740" style="s2">you can get all the interesting articles</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:13.270" style="s2">that you like somewhere and somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.740" end="00:09:14.709" style="s2">saying something interesting you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.270" end="00:09:17.410" style="s2">piece them together but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.709" end="00:09:19.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no institutional home where you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.410" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">can trust that like a you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.660" end="00:09:23.320" style="s2">Office of Management and Budget or</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:25.149" style="s2">something or but it&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.320" end="00:09:27.370" style="s2">saying to be a bad for journalists about</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.149" end="00:09:30.040" style="s2">journalism in general is that what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.370" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">think of as the institution I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.040" end="00:09:36.100" style="s2">like the veneer the front-facing website</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">is not even an institution in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.100" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like a you can it&#39;s a hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:43.330" style="s2">differentiate what is a blog and what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:45.370" style="s2">an actual journalistic resource that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.330" end="00:09:48.550" style="s2">editors and fact checkers and copy</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.370" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">editors and you know for certain sites</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.550" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">the distinction is it&#39;s apparently</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.660" style="s2">non-existent meso like you know people</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:57.190" style="s2">used to think salon was real journalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.660" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">or at with the Guardian I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.190" end="00:10:00.550" style="s2">Guardian has like I kind of the blog</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:01.540" style="s2">side and then write the Guardian say you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.550" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">can&#39;t tell the difference you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.540" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">reading what somebody wrote and well and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:07.930" style="s2">you find the same people on Twitter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.980" end="00:10:09.580" style="s2">yeah and then everyone it&#39;s nuts on</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.930" end="00:10:12.400" style="s2">Twitter what whatever their reputation</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.580" end="00:10:13.990" style="s2">right really is you know or should have</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.400" end="00:10:16.870" style="s2">been well but you could just see their</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.990" end="00:10:18.130" style="s2">bias like they&#39;re not hiding it on</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.870" end="00:10:20.890" style="s2">Twitter and then they hide it when</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.130" end="00:10:22.900" style="s2">they&#39;re in their journalistic frame well</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.890" end="00:10:26.200" style="s2">that would argue that on I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.900" end="00:10:29.400" style="s2">forgiving on that point because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.200" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">that Trump has made the hiding of ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.400" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">so-called bias a irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.570" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s like you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:40.089" style="s2">can&#39;t pretend that this is a normal</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.570" end="00:10:41.470" style="s2">president doing normal things no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.089" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">gonna be a normal journalist without an</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.470" end="00:10:47.500" style="s2">opinion I agree with that although I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">would say you and I are very split on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:52.990" style="s2">this so should put a placeholder maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">we&#39;ll get back to it maybe not that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.990" end="00:10:57.850" style="s2">more worried about the loss of things</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:11:00.579" style="s2">like nature and science than I am the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.850" end="00:11:03.250" style="s2">New York Times I&#39;m now worried that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.579" end="00:11:05.580" style="s2">there is nothing and even in the hard</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.250" end="00:11:09.390" style="s2">sciences almost the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.580" end="00:11:11.640" style="s2">stand up to the onslaught of political</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.390" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">pressure creeping into everything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.640" end="00:11:16.620" style="s2">has to be able to say no then we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">the ability to tell people to screw off</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.620" end="00:11:23.610" style="s2">if they&#39;re wrong I&#39;ve certainly been</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">creeping up on us in the life sciences</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.610" end="00:11:28.230" style="s2">it&#39;s been true of the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.410" end="00:11:30.180" style="s2">for a very long time yeah it probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.230" end="00:11:31.110" style="s2">you know physics and math are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">the last to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.110" end="00:11:38.360" style="s2">but I&#39;ve even seen a little bit of it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">roads there and so I I find the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.360" end="00:11:43.740" style="s2">nature and cell and the universities</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:46.830" style="s2">terrifying effort differently from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.740" end="00:11:51.030" style="s2">New York Times like this is this is a</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.030" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">you not perceive that oh I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.580" end="00:11:57.660" style="s2">they&#39;re just different problems I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:12:01.650" style="s2">know which is more consequential I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.660" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">the I think the the failure to have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.650" end="00:12:12.630" style="s2">fact-based discussion and the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:15.210" style="s2">to avoid one I think that&#39;s a just the</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.890" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">a new set of rules that proved</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:48.540" style="s2">apparently appearing online and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.200" end="00:13:53.250" style="s2">you know one of the most woke and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.540" end="00:13:56.280" style="s2">sanctimonious enforcers of this new norm</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.250" end="00:14:00.510" style="s2">of just you know political correctness</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.280" end="00:14:04.350" style="s2">you know stretching to infinity and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.510" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">he&#39;s got not only black face in his past</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:14.010" style="s2">blackface that&#39;s a recurring issue yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.990" end="00:14:18.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s I mean the hypocrisy is is</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.220" end="00:14:30.780" style="s2">yet at least there&#39;s these new norms of</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.330" end="00:14:38.940" style="s2">it&#39;s not say you can we can&#39;t do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.260" end="00:14:40.710" style="s2">of harm to ourselves in the mean time or</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:42.690" style="s2">in certain areas I think we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.710" end="00:14:47.550" style="s2">do harm to ourselves yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.690" end="00:14:50.550" style="s2">the idea you know sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.550" end="00:14:54.030" style="s2">about Trump as the doctor has to break a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.550" end="00:14:55.800" style="s2">bone that has miss been miss set in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.030" end="00:14:57.870" style="s2">hopes that it can finally heal properly</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.800" end="00:15:00.030" style="s2">and this is one of the places where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.870" end="00:15:02.250" style="s2">as a doctor who doesn&#39;t know which bony</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.030" end="00:15:04.890" style="s2">hasn&#39;t hand and and isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.250" end="00:15:06.600" style="s2">intending to heal you so well he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.890" end="00:15:08.250" style="s2">it&#39;s the happy accident of the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.600" end="00:15:11.220" style="s2">happens the mad man who happens to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.250" end="00:15:12.839" style="s2">a hold of the right femur and is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.220" end="00:15:14.940" style="s2">breaking it for the wrong reasons but to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.839" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">good effect right or you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.940" end="00:15:21.870" style="s2">doctorate in folklore and from some non</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">accredited university so it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.870" end="00:15:25.890" style="s2">keep segway on you but I know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">passion for India I remember once</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">a doctor&#39;s it was actually a dentist&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.790" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">and it was say you know western-trained</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.610" end="00:15:40.260" style="s2">dentist and in parentheses failed but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:41.580" style="s2">but having just haven&#39;t made the attempt</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">was enough to put that on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.580" end="00:15:50.610" style="s2">shingle oh that&#39;s good yeah I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:54.600" style="s2">does hey so I I think you get Trump</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.610" end="00:15:57.030" style="s2">wrong right and it&#39;s not I see what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.600" end="00:16:00.060" style="s2">see and I it&#39;s maddening it&#39;s driving me</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.030" end="00:16:02.840" style="s2">crazy I the idea of spending four more</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.060" end="00:16:05.190" style="s2">precious years of my win dling life</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.840" end="00:16:08.430" style="s2">talking about whatever Trump last said</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.190" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">or tweeted or worried that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.430" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">what would happen if we actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:16.920" style="s2">five-alarm fire in the US that had to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:18.600" style="s2">handled do you think my model of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.920" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">mind is wrong or my model of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.600" end="00:16:24.930" style="s2">consequences of him being in office is</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">wrong well I think that you were slow to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:32.510" style="s2">give him his due I mean of course as you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.110" end="00:16:35.190" style="s2">know I wrote this essay on kayfabe right</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.510" end="00:16:37.530" style="s2">anticipating that professional wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:39.750" style="s2">was going to turn out to be incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.530" end="00:16:41.430" style="s2">important and in fact I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.750" end="00:16:45.300" style="s2">going to determine the presidency that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.430" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">was a belief I had that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.300" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">how lies play within the mind and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:53.130" style="s2">époque recei works and then a concept</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:56.810" style="s2">called namespaces out of Python</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.130" end="00:17:00.510" style="s2">programming like how we compartmentalize</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.810" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">led me to believe that in essence we</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.510" end="00:17:05.190" style="s2">were I had seen these other candidacies</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:06.780" style="s2">in other countries in which people seem</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.190" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">not to be able to distinguish an actor</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.780" end="00:17:11.640" style="s2">from the character that they played you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:14.430" style="s2">know and whatnot and so I I believed</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.640" end="00:17:17.250" style="s2">that the system of lies within</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.430" end="00:17:19.680" style="s2">professional wrestling told us what was</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.250" end="00:17:22.800" style="s2">possible and Trump actually sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.680" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">out of the WWE through his association</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.800" end="00:17:27.810" style="s2">with with the McMahon family yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.040" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">believe that he actually understood deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.810" end="00:17:33.780" style="s2">things that psychology departments will</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:37.740" style="s2">wake up to 20 years from now yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.780" end="00:17:40.590" style="s2">guess there&#39;s a I suggest I&#39;ve suggested</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.740" end="00:17:42.360" style="s2">by analogy to the Chauncey Gardiner</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.590" end="00:17:44.970" style="s2">effect or the evil Chauncey Gardiner</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.360" end="00:17:46.539" style="s2">effect well but it has rational yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2">think I think but it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.539" end="00:17:50.740" style="s2">that could happen I mean it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:52.750" style="s2">right it&#39;s definitely falsifiable my</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.740" end="00:17:55.389" style="s2">theory is falsifiable he could prove to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.750" end="00:17:58.299" style="s2">me with a string of utterances that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.389" end="00:18:00.639" style="s2">the evil genius that i haven&#39;t imagined</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.299" end="00:18:02.710" style="s2">him to be but he said I mean if you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.639" end="00:18:03.070" style="s2">I had a couple of old fashions between</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.710" end="00:18:05.529" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.070" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2">and we sat down with a thousand of his</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.529" end="00:18:09.130" style="s2">tweets we could figure out that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">were current structures and we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.130" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">write analyze a program to generate them</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:16.419" style="s2">to tangle Democrats I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:19.059" style="s2">much more method to the madness and I I</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.419" end="00:18:21.059" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go full Scott Adams that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.059" end="00:18:23.769" style="s2">Scott I know you&#39;re out there somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.059" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">to say that everything is intentional</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.769" end="00:18:29.799" style="s2">and brilliant I just think he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:31.149" style="s2">you know it was for years I said that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.799" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">he wanted to win an election against a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.149" end="00:18:34.809" style="s2">Democrat you just would talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:36.309" style="s2">nuclear family well let them correct you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.809" end="00:18:38.500" style="s2">to nuclear right and then you&#39;d win</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.309" end="00:18:40.630" style="s2">because you come across an ass yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.500" end="00:18:42.639" style="s2">right exactly so I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.630" end="00:18:44.470" style="s2">certain amount of method that you were</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.639" end="00:18:47.380" style="s2">slow to give you give him credit for but</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.470" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">I think you&#39;re probably inching towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.380" end="00:18:52.899" style="s2">the idea that if he&#39;s not an evil genius</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">he has some evil genius I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.899" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">just again I am enamored of my Chauncey</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:19:01.019" style="s2">Gardiner analogy all right well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:19:07.059" style="s2">another analogy that is even simpler and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.019" end="00:19:08.440" style="s2">easy easier to confirm it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.059" end="00:19:11.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a method but I think it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.440" end="00:19:15.429" style="s2">very simple method that the power of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.169" end="00:19:17.019" style="s2">which is an accident of the context so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.429" end="00:19:18.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like an Instagram model has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.019" end="00:19:21.220" style="s2">method right you know they just if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.820" end="00:19:22.990" style="s2">have a great body show it to great</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.220" end="00:19:24.340" style="s2">effect on your Instagram channel and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.990" end="00:19:26.380" style="s2">then wait around for people to follow</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.340" end="00:19:29.070" style="s2">you right so there&#39;s a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.380" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">formula there&#39;s no question it works</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.070" end="00:19:34.659" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s not a lot of method to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">but in the rallies that he likes the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.659" end="00:19:39.429" style="s2">rallies are a feedback mechanism right</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:41.019" style="s2">so he know he knows that the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.429" end="00:19:44.889" style="s2">that he&#39;s getting from the press in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.019" end="00:19:47.380" style="s2">general has a constant distortion and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.889" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">by holding a rally he can figure out to</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.420" end="00:28:33.090" style="s2">this for me falls in another sector not</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">economy but foreign policy you look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.090" end="00:28:38.370" style="s2">somebody like Samantha power right who</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:41.420" style="s2">you know who wrote the famous book on</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.370" end="00:28:44.940" style="s2">genocide a problem from hell</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.980" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">Rwanda right at that we were morally</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.770" end="00:28:53.430" style="s2">culpable in some basic sense for not</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">having intervened right week</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.430" end="00:28:58.410" style="s2">have stopped the bloodshed we didn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">we even had you know Navy SEAL Teams I</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:07.800" style="s2">Jocko I think was offshore you know at</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.970" end="00:29:09.960" style="s2">the time and we would you know he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.800" end="00:29:11.130" style="s2">drawn the lesson from Somalia seeing our</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.960" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">you know the the Black Hawk Down</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.130" end="00:29:17.160" style="s2">incident seeing our soldiers dragged</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:18.900" style="s2">through the streets that we just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.160" end="00:29:20.670" style="s2">get involved and what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.900" end="00:29:22.020" style="s2">you&#39;re the the one superpower and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.670" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">decide you can&#39;t get involved well then</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.020" end="00:29:27.300" style="s2">people you know butcher their neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:30.390" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way to stop them so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.300" end="00:29:34.830" style="s2">think with the best of intentions she</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.390" end="00:29:37.620" style="s2">and many others drew the lesson that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.830" end="00:29:39.420" style="s2">really do have to be the world&#39;s cop on</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.620" end="00:29:40.770" style="s2">some level and we have to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.420" end="00:29:43.530" style="s2">and we&#39;re morally culpable for not</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.770" end="00:29:46.410" style="s2">stopping up a rape in progress or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.530" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">murder in progress and but now we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.410" end="00:29:52.200" style="s2">the other side of that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:29:53.460" style="s2">shaped horror curve where we now know</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.200" end="00:29:57.090" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to get involved with</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.460" end="00:29:59.550" style="s2">however mixed intentions and we and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.090" end="00:30:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a thankless job right like a bill</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.550" end="00:30:05.010" style="s2">nation-building is not it&#39;s not a job</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.400" end="00:30:06.660" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna want for for a long</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.010" end="00:30:09.060" style="s2">time and for good reason I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.660" end="00:30:11.640" style="s2">some weird backstory on that one no I</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.060" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">I knew Samantha power at the Kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.640" end="00:30:17.370" style="s2">School and she and I sat down I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:19.950" style="s2">well I think we sat down at a meal we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.370" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">had friends that connected us I asked</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.950" end="00:30:23.220" style="s2">what you were it what what are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:25.700" style="s2">interested in and she said well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.220" end="00:30:30.390" style="s2">obsessed with the Red Sox and genocide</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:32.130" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good icebreaker um and she</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.390" end="00:30:33.900" style="s2">said well you know the rap on me is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.130" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">all genocide all the time but nobody</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.900" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">cares and I you know I&#39;ve got this book</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">and I can&#39;t figure out the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:43.620" style="s2">question why is there not a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:46.710" style="s2">that we will never why is never again</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.620" end="00:30:49.590" style="s2">not a resolution and every time I try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.710" end="00:30:51.180" style="s2">get a state to sign up for this or</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.590" end="00:30:53.130" style="s2">somebody to take this seriously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.180" end="00:30:54.540" style="s2">this weird wall that comes down it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.130" end="00:30:56.340" style="s2">clearest thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.540" end="00:30:59.610" style="s2">that we should never let genocide ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.340" end="00:31:01.500" style="s2">happen again right and she was convinced</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.610" end="00:31:03.900" style="s2">nobody&#39;s gonna take her seriously this</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.500" end="00:31:06.030" style="s2">was gonna go nowhere and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.900" end="00:31:07.260" style="s2">progressively somehow this thing started</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.030" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">to catch fire and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.260" end="00:31:10.830" style="s2">for a period of time I was emailing her</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:12.600" style="s2">like do you believe it now do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.830" end="00:31:15.390" style="s2">believe it now but this because I I knew</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.600" end="00:31:17.750" style="s2">this thing was gonna get huge I also</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.390" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">knew that it wasn&#39;t gonna work because</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.750" end="00:31:24.930" style="s2">it just it comes from this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:26.100" style="s2">place that is not really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.930" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">beautiful I mean it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.100" end="00:31:31.830" style="s2">meretricious its appealing but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:33.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand what the forces are</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.830" end="00:31:36.360" style="s2">the create genocide because very few</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.450" end="00:31:40.050" style="s2">people want to go that deep on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.360" end="00:31:42.300" style="s2">question and in that case I saw a human</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.050" end="00:31:44.310" style="s2">being who I can just vouch for they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.300" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">this was the purest of intentions</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.310" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">early on and then it that the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:53.280" style="s2">started to reveal themselves she became</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:55.230" style="s2">and meshed in a very difficult series of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.280" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">Tralee problems or you know Charlie like</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.230" end="00:32:00.840" style="s2">problems right I believe that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:02.850" style="s2">partially happens in places like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.840" end="00:32:04.560" style="s2">Facebook and Google but very often I</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.850" end="00:32:06.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s your theory of mine that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.560" end="00:32:08.400" style="s2">gonna take issue with which is that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.150" end="00:32:10.500" style="s2">don&#39;t think people are is unified in</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.400" end="00:32:13.410" style="s2">their thinking they very often have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.500" end="00:32:14.970" style="s2">mercenary part of their brain and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.410" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">beautiful part of their brain and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.970" end="00:32:17.940" style="s2">have a partition that keeps those from</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:21.210" style="s2">talking to each other then one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.940" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">ways in which I found this out was when</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.210" end="00:32:27.330" style="s2">a group of people doctors actually in</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.580" end="00:32:29.550" style="s2">New York City wanted to sort of used me</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.330" end="00:32:32.250" style="s2">as a consultant from my mathematical and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.550" end="00:32:34.770" style="s2">analytic mind and we went out for a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.250" end="00:32:35.580" style="s2">fancy dinner and they said I said what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.770" end="00:32:38.100" style="s2">the topic and they said</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.580" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">reconceptualizing medical debt I knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.100" end="00:32:42.300" style="s2">nothing about this and essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:45.960" style="s2">they told me is is that if you go to an</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.300" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">emergency room and you agree to have all</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.960" end="00:32:51.210" style="s2">sorts of things done mm-hmm you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:52.950" style="s2">feel like paying exorbitant inflated</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.210" end="00:32:53.820" style="s2">bills later because you feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.950" end="00:32:57.030" style="s2">was an emergency</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.820" end="00:32:58.890" style="s2">I had no ability to actually think this</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.030" end="00:33:01.320" style="s2">through shop around yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.890" end="00:33:04.800" style="s2">this is extortionary but if you give</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.320" end="00:33:06.780" style="s2">somebody the ability to say okay what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.800" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">what if you pay us 82 cents on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.780" end="00:33:14.340" style="s2">dollar and well we&#39;ll let 18 cents go</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.230" end="00:33:18.180" style="s2">then suddenly the the the performance of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.340" end="00:33:23.850" style="s2">that debt skyrockets</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.180" end="00:33:25.050" style="s2">and a phrase came out which was when</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.850" end="00:33:28.170" style="s2">they talked about reconceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.050" end="00:33:30.210" style="s2">they said it&#39;s a beautiful thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.170" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">realized that I had heard that phrase in</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.210" end="00:33:34.980" style="s2">New York whenever people are up to no</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:36.540" style="s2">good it&#39;s a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.980" end="00:33:40.050" style="s2">what&#39;s a beautiful thing you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.540" end="00:33:41.910" style="s2">just and so I then put out this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.050" end="00:33:43.500" style="s2">my group which is did you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.910" end="00:33:44.910" style="s2">when people in New York do bad things to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.500" end="00:33:48.330" style="s2">other people they always say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.910" end="00:33:49.710" style="s2">beautiful thing and sure enough it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.330" end="00:33:51.750" style="s2">caught in people&#39;s minds whenever</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.710" end="00:33:55.170" style="s2">anybody started to say it they realized</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.750" end="00:33:57.390" style="s2">oh my gosh I mean a part of my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.170" end="00:34:01.080" style="s2">recognizes that I can transfer wealth</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.390" end="00:34:03.630" style="s2">from somebody else to me largely without</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.080" end="00:34:06.810" style="s2">the other person knowing it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.630" end="00:34:09.330" style="s2">that results in benefit from me and some</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.810" end="00:34:11.490" style="s2">harm that&#39;s been externalized I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.330" end="00:34:14.550" style="s2">that people both know that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.490" end="00:34:16.080" style="s2">tremendous harm and carry the idealism</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.550" end="00:34:18.390" style="s2">that propels it and that&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.080" end="00:34:20.640" style="s2">combination of these things and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.390" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">that they don&#39;t talk to each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.640" end="00:34:25.320" style="s2">well I think people are you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:27.030" style="s2">get me to disagree there that people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.320" end="00:34:33.419" style="s2">impressively split or at least can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.030" end="00:34:35.940" style="s2">and I think coherence generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.419" end="00:34:37.620" style="s2">it or at least striving for it is good</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.940" end="00:34:42.330" style="s2">I&#39;m I think I live in an examined life</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.620" end="00:34:44.280" style="s2">in part is is is struggling with those</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.330" end="00:34:47.010" style="s2">discoveries of incoherence and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.280" end="00:34:49.050" style="s2">figuring out how to to get this Congress</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.010" end="00:34:50.970" style="s2">of mine as you call yourself to actually</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.970" end="00:34:55.710" style="s2">cohere yeah no so but I but when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:35:00.660" style="s2">talking about the normal person who I</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.710" end="00:35:05.070" style="s2">think it is a frequent phenomenon to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.660" end="00:35:06.510" style="s2">to have you know normal than the normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.070" end="00:35:09.510" style="s2">range of good intentions to not be a</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.510" end="00:35:13.650" style="s2">be in philanthropy for instance right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.250" end="00:35:15.650" style="s2">to actually to be this I mean you&#39;re or</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.650" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">if you&#39;re devoting your life if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">a good degree who could work more or</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:25.830" style="s2">less anywhere but you decide to work for</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:27.180" style="s2">for a charity right you&#39;re already an</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.830" end="00:35:29.400" style="s2">outlier you&#39;re already somebody who said</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.180" end="00:35:31.170" style="s2">no to Wall Street or no to Hollywood or</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.400" end="00:35:31.859" style="s2">no to something and now you&#39;re working</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.859" end="00:35:34.680" style="s2">the Southern Poverty Law Center or</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.089" end="00:35:36.839" style="s2">something like you want to just stop</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.680" end="00:35:37.230" style="s2">racism right so you&#39;re already one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.839" end="00:35:41.489" style="s2">the good guys</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.230" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">right and but see I mean you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.489" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">is a example dear to my heart that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:48.930" style="s2">flog at every opportunity the Southern</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:51.630" style="s2">Poverty Law Center is you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.930" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">was probably consciously started for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.630" end="00:35:56.819" style="s2">best of intentions operated under the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:35:59.309" style="s2">the you know that the the blindingly</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.819" end="00:36:01.859" style="s2">brilliant light of those intentions for</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.309" end="00:36:05.519" style="s2">a very long time but something flipped</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.859" end="00:36:07.710" style="s2">and one thing that flipped is that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.519" end="00:36:10.739" style="s2">and it&#39;s probably unbeknownst to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.710" end="00:36:12.799" style="s2">everybody there&#39;s a bad incentive</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.739" end="00:36:16.249" style="s2">problem here I mean the the only way</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.799" end="00:36:20.099" style="s2">they survive as an organization is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.249" end="00:36:22.259" style="s2">continue to stay at in this sort of long</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.099" end="00:36:24.660" style="s2">emergency mode of there are nazis</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.259" end="00:36:25.470" style="s2">everywhere right everyone it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.660" end="00:36:28.499" style="s2">is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.470" end="00:36:30.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a four-alarm fire give us money we</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.499" end="00:36:31.499" style="s2">now have a budget of whatever it is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.180" end="00:36:35.519" style="s2">know thirty million dollars a year I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.499" end="00:36:38.460" style="s2">mean it&#39;s got to be huge and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.519" end="00:36:39.960" style="s2">the fundraising drive never stops and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.460" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">what happens to an organization like</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.960" end="00:36:44.609" style="s2">that when you begin to run out of Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">well then you gotta you have to find</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.609" end="00:36:48.900" style="s2">more right like you can&#39;t yet the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">incentive is to never recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.900" end="00:36:53.609" style="s2">you&#39;ve gotten a handle on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:56.220" style="s2">right it&#39;d be like you know in some you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.609" end="00:36:58.109" style="s2">know epidemiological space where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.220" end="00:36:59.759" style="s2">know you&#39;re curing smallpox but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.109" end="00:37:01.470" style="s2">could never admit that you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.759" end="00:37:03.450" style="s2">cured it you have to pretend to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.470" end="00:37:04.890" style="s2">smallpox everywhere now I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.450" end="00:37:06.269" style="s2">obviously I must say and white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.890" end="00:37:09.059" style="s2">or white power or anything has been</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.269" end="00:37:12.239" style="s2">cured but what has happened is you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.059" end="00:37:14.849" style="s2">people who probably were true outliers</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.239" end="00:37:17.269" style="s2">in their in their ethical scrupulous &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.849" end="00:37:19.859" style="s2">who are now behaving in appalling ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.269" end="00:37:21.150" style="s2">you know different people&#39;s reputations</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.859" end="00:37:23.220" style="s2">calling them Nazis when they know</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.150" end="00:37:25.259" style="s2">they&#39;re not not so well let&#39;s be let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.220" end="00:37:28.890" style="s2">put a finer point on it they are now</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.259" end="00:37:31.559" style="s2">more likely to let the genie out of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.890" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">bottle because of their bad behavior or</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.559" end="00:37:38.539" style="s2">to you know huff and puff on an ember</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:41.489" style="s2">that is the pathetic Ku Klux Klan of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.539" end="00:37:43.170" style="s2">2019 right to actually create something</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.489" end="00:37:45.600" style="s2">that could they could turn into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.170" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">roaring fire I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:50.190" style="s2">this is a general feature I often talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.200" style="s2">about this in terms of magnetic and true</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.190" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">north where the angle of declination</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.200" end="00:37:58.980" style="s2">that separates them is very small at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:38:00.660" style="s2">equator you know in northern Canada you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.980" end="00:38:03.630" style="s2">know it it&#39;s very large</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.660" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">yeah right and and at the at the pole</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.630" end="00:38:07.640" style="s2">and South is everywhere well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:10.440" style="s2">right yeah right and so it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.640" end="00:38:12.180" style="s2">problem is is that the institution I</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.440" end="00:38:14.580" style="s2">mean look I&#39;ve made this point elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.180" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">so regular listeners will have heard it</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.580" end="00:38:19.800" style="s2">but the concept of the embedded growth</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">obligation the ego of an institution</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.800" end="00:38:26.700" style="s2">which is it has to do work and grow in</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:28.650" style="s2">order to meet its mandates that is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.700" end="00:38:31.020" style="s2">thing that has metastasized throughout</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.650" end="00:38:33.450" style="s2">our institutional structure and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.020" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">not the Southern Poverty Law Center I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.450" end="00:38:41.430" style="s2">mean that&#39;s particularly egregious but</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">the entire university system every</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.430" end="00:38:46.590" style="s2">single measure you can take on that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:50.820" style="s2">thing looks like an intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.590" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">wealth transfer right down to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.820" end="00:38:55.290" style="s2">nondischargeability of student debt and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.990" style="s2">bankruptcy whether the loading up of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.290" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">every university by administrators and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.990" end="00:39:04.350" style="s2">the monopolization at the moment almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:07.050" style="s2">100% of our leading institutions are run</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.350" end="00:39:09.390" style="s2">by a baby boomer whereas the average age</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.050" end="00:39:11.130" style="s2">in a different era of a university</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.390" end="00:39:13.740" style="s2">president we could have most of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.130" end="00:39:15.290" style="s2">under Gen X control and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.740" end="00:39:18.630" style="s2">under millennial control there were</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.290" end="00:39:21.660" style="s2">university presidents in their 30s who</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.630" end="00:39:24.290" style="s2">had a huge impact I mean that is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.660" end="00:39:28.380" style="s2">system which has gone totally metastatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.290" end="00:39:30.330" style="s2">yeah you know that may be an outlier I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:33.180" style="s2">mean this is the way the word it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.330" end="00:39:35.700" style="s2">worst large system of its kind yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.180" end="00:39:39.240" style="s2">mean the way costs have gone up there</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.700" end="00:39:41.700" style="s2">way outpacing inflation medical pacing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.240" end="00:39:45.060" style="s2">medical and yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.700" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">and the fact that you can&#39;t discharge</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.060" end="00:39:52.170" style="s2">your debt in bankruptcy yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">fact that net you know many of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.170" end="00:39:54.780" style="s2">friends have spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:56.790" style="s2">complaining about this but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.780" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2">you have whole fields that are</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.809" end="00:42:59.549" style="s2">all is is that my head is so filled with</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.849" end="00:43:01.950" style="s2">malware I&#39;ve got I&#39;m running so many</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.069" end="00:43:11.789" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find the nonsense well so</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.799" end="00:43:13.770" style="s2">for what you&#39;re worried about</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.789" end="00:43:16.279" style="s2">yeah well so we&#39;re currently sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.770" end="00:43:22.049" style="s2">a room with reflective glass and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.279" end="00:43:25.260" style="s2">anechoic tiles that deaden sound hmm if</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.049" end="00:43:27.089" style="s2">I echolocate buy things that I am</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.260" end="00:43:31.289" style="s2">absolutely positive would sell</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.089" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">newspapers that aren&#39;t printed that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.289" end="00:43:35.339" style="s2">like okay you&#39;re echolocating and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">instead of hearing the reflection off of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.339" end="00:43:41.039" style="s2">glass you&#39;re hearing a an absence which</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:43.020" style="s2">is anechoic tile and so if I just look</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.039" end="00:43:45.180" style="s2">at Google Trends which tells me what</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.020" end="00:43:46.619" style="s2">people are searching on if I look at how</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.180" end="00:43:48.660" style="s2">Google autocompletes</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.619" end="00:43:50.069" style="s2">which tells me what they want me to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.660" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">is what other people are searching on in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.069" end="00:43:55.220" style="s2">the search bar if I look at what stories</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:58.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t being run all of the dead stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.220" end="00:44:02.220" style="s2">is astounding to me it right at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:04.289" style="s2">moment like I know for example that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.220" end="00:44:08.549" style="s2">people are fascinated by the Jeffrey</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.289" end="00:44:11.039" style="s2">Epstein story mm-hmm and in general like</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.549" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">you know we just had it so normally I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.039" end="00:44:14.460" style="s2">don&#39;t love talking about current events</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:18.569" style="s2">because it dates the program but we just</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.460" end="00:44:21.210" style="s2">had Kevin Spacey&#39;s accuser reported as</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.569" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">dying I don&#39;t think that that is likely</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.210" end="00:44:26.039" style="s2">to be part of some super evil plot so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:26.500" style="s2">just so people can calibrate it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.039" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.500" end="00:44:31.290" style="s2">that could make sense because there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:33.820" style="s2">incentive I chalk up to it a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.290" end="00:44:35.770" style="s2">the Jeffrey Epstein thing is totally</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.820" end="00:44:39.220" style="s2">different and you and I both met this</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.770" end="00:44:40.810" style="s2">guy for 15 years and he&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.220" end="00:44:42.910" style="s2">person I&#39;ve been saying this with</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.810" end="00:44:45.430" style="s2">conviction about for 15 years I had one</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.910" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">meeting with him I said he&#39;s a construct</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.430" end="00:44:51.010" style="s2">somebody hired a person probably named</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:53.500" style="s2">Jeffrey Epstein to play a role</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.010" end="00:44:56.320" style="s2">super genius mega billionaire</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.500" end="00:44:57.580" style="s2">philanthropist I wasn&#39;t buying any I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.320" end="00:45:00.340" style="s2">never bought it and I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.580" end="00:45:02.740" style="s2">everybody in our sort of mutual network</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.340" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">and I always used one word because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.740" end="00:45:07.420" style="s2">want to make a huge bet that when the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">time came I would say he&#39;s a construct</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.420" end="00:45:10.630" style="s2">and that I would be revealed to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:14.470" style="s2">correct and that everybody was s what do</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.630" end="00:45:16.030" style="s2">you mean by a construct right okay do</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.470" end="00:45:17.950" style="s2">you need to have you clarified that on</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.030" end="00:45:19.960" style="s2">your podcast before probably not I I I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.950" end="00:45:23.320" style="s2">recorded an entire Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.960" end="00:45:25.420" style="s2">episode which is just me soloing for an</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.320" end="00:45:26.230" style="s2">hour right but I haven&#39;t released it</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.420" end="00:45:29.260" style="s2">because I&#39;m terrified</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.230" end="00:45:31.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve had one ambiguous dinner where</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.260" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">somebody sort of quasi threatened me and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.120" end="00:45:35.980" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:41.020" style="s2">saying was a little bit creepy well this</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.980" end="00:45:43.240" style="s2">is a strand of human complication that</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.240" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t deny that it exists right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.190" end="00:45:49.380" style="s2">like I think there are real conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:53.620" style="s2">and then powerful people occasionally</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.620" end="00:45:58.090" style="s2">occasionally sociopaths and then they</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:46:00.550" style="s2">then they do what you would expect or</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.090" end="00:46:03.850" style="s2">conspire to do what you&#39;d expect so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.550" end="00:46:05.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have a strong feeling about well</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.850" end="00:46:08.620" style="s2">it&#39;s just takes livelihood that Epstein</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.290" end="00:46:09.610" style="s2">was was had a facilitated suicide I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.620" end="00:46:12.790" style="s2">think the likelihood that he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.610" end="00:46:14.440" style="s2">murdered is low but I submit suicide I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.790" end="00:46:15.970" style="s2">don&#39;t have a I&#39;m agnostic about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.440" end="00:46:17.290" style="s2">whether whether some people stepped away</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.970" end="00:46:19.420" style="s2">so that he could do the thing that he</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.290" end="00:46:21.370" style="s2">needed to do whether there&#39;s some</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.430" end="00:46:28.870" style="s2">that at at very low I put that very low</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.500" end="00:46:31.390" style="s2">odds as well yeah but I saw you but no</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.870" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">I&#39;m a fan of zero odds soon well I</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.390" end="00:46:35.740" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I know enough about probability</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">and to put almost nothing in zero huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.740" end="00:46:39.310" style="s2">huge difference between those people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.480" end="00:46:40.030" style="s2">insist when I hear somebody insists that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.310" end="00:46:42.940" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.030" end="00:46:45.220" style="s2">d b0 I kicked butt and that person is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.940" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">smart but effectively effectively zero</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:48.340" style="s2">I&#39;m a zero in the sense that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:50.050" style="s2">have I worry about I waste no time</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.340" end="00:46:51.910" style="s2">thinking about it at the moment right</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.050" end="00:46:53.740" style="s2">but I&#39;m happy to have my Bayesian priors</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.910" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">tutored right okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.740" end="00:47:02.280" style="s2">so I I just don&#39;t have a amazing you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:05.170" style="s2">know I&#39;m taken in or I utilize this</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.280" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">homily that you shouldn&#39;t ascribe to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.170" end="00:47:08.260" style="s2">malice what can be explained by</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:09.690" style="s2">incompetence or whatever that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.260" end="00:47:12.370" style="s2">formulation and I find that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.690" end="00:47:14.020" style="s2">interesting heuristic for somebody it</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.370" end="00:47:16.270" style="s2">says it&#39;s usually I think it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.020" end="00:47:18.460" style="s2">true right so it&#39;s like it works much of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.270" end="00:47:20.380" style="s2">the time and then it it fails but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.460" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">fails in a case where you get more</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.380" end="00:47:23.410" style="s2">information and then you update you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what that was review it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.410" end="00:47:27.310" style="s2">exactly my point that the Kevin Spacey</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:29.800" style="s2">thing I would say is in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.310" end="00:47:32.470" style="s2">Newtonian mechanics right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.800" end="00:47:33.940" style="s2">Jeff Epstein thing is like relativistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.470" end="00:47:36.040" style="s2">quantum field theory whatever your</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.940" end="00:47:38.500" style="s2">Newtonian laws are we&#39;re not in Kansas</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.040" end="00:47:39.880" style="s2">in right but I had no lie so I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.500" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">put me in the same room with him so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.880" end="00:47:43.300" style="s2">should probably clarify that so I had I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:46.150" style="s2">found myself but you both apologize</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.300" end="00:47:49.660" style="s2">nothing happened yeah yes right</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.150" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">I found myself at a lunch with him at</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.660" end="00:47:56.290" style="s2">the TED conference and had no insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:58.090" style="s2">into him or what he was up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.290" end="00:48:01.690" style="s2">apart from the fact that he you know my</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.090" end="00:48:03.880" style="s2">sort of creep detector went off and iris</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.690" end="00:48:06.070" style="s2">piked like crazy yeah I mean I just he</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.880" end="00:48:08.680" style="s2">was someone who I didn&#39;t want to spend</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.070" end="00:48:16.840" style="s2">any more time with because he had this</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.680" end="00:48:18.040" style="s2">sort of schlock e rich guy but with well</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.840" end="00:48:20.770" style="s2">no know him it&#39;s just but like when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:24.550" style="s2">see a I guess he was probably you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.770" end="00:48:27.460" style="s2">close to 60 at this point and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.550" end="00:48:29.050" style="s2">he&#39;s with a you know 21 year old you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.460" end="00:48:30.910" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that the optics</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.050" end="00:48:32.890" style="s2">of that are all with it means that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.910" end="00:48:34.840" style="s2">obviously the many rich guys who do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.890" end="00:48:37.240" style="s2">you know and they&#39;re many certainly many</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.840" end="00:48:38.620" style="s2">people in Hollywood to do that and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.240" end="00:48:39.910" style="s2">know that&#39;s just the way people some</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.620" end="00:48:41.260" style="s2">people roll when they have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.910" end="00:48:44.110" style="s2">opportunity to roll that way and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.260" end="00:48:46.120" style="s2">okay fine but he there was just a I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.110" end="00:48:48.430" style="s2">a kind of a level of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.120" end="00:48:52.030" style="s2">judgmentalism around that right you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.430" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like at minimum that&#39;s a a an</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.030" end="00:48:57.609" style="s2">attractor on the on the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:59.140" style="s2">of well-being that is not all that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.609" end="00:49:00.819" style="s2">interesting to me and so when you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.140" end="00:49:04.119" style="s2">someone captivated by that like this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.819" end="00:49:06.040" style="s2">like life is going great because I&#39;m 60</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.119" end="00:49:07.869" style="s2">and she&#39;s 20 right like that I have one</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.040" end="00:49:10.089" style="s2">variable that there was how much about</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.869" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">his labor Guinea Oh exactly right okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.089" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">then you&#39;ve you know you&#39;ve bored me</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.160" end="00:49:20.589" style="s2">already so but I had no more insight</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:22.329" style="s2">into him than that I maybe I didn&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.589" end="00:49:24.069" style="s2">not three sentences from one meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.329" end="00:49:25.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about him for 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.069" end="00:49:27.490" style="s2">right you end up because this was like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.210" end="00:49:29.829" style="s2">ten person lunch okay and I had maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.490" end="00:49:32.109" style="s2">you know three sentences exchanged with</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.829" end="00:49:35.049" style="s2">him you know so mine was at his house</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.109" end="00:49:37.290" style="s2">right I&#39;m assured into a waiting room</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.049" end="00:49:41.319" style="s2">he&#39;s got some super complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.290" end="00:49:44.140" style="s2">electronical electronic art I get up I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.319" end="00:49:47.559" style="s2">look at it I said wait is that is that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.140" end="00:49:49.780" style="s2">camera inside the art I first think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.559" end="00:49:52.329" style="s2">a genius for finding cameras I think my</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.780" end="00:49:54.040" style="s2">next thought is I&#39;m supposed to find the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.329" end="00:49:55.569" style="s2">camera inside the art because the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.040" end="00:49:57.160" style="s2">can&#39;t the art is supposed to draw my</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.569" end="00:50:03.130" style="s2">attention I&#39;m supposed to see that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.160" end="00:50:05.980" style="s2">being recorded I&#39;m called out to a room</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.130" end="00:50:08.470" style="s2">and back with a huge longing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.980" end="00:50:10.599" style="s2">exaggerated dining table with a giant</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.470" end="00:50:13.180" style="s2">American flag as its tablecloth so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.599" end="00:50:16.030" style="s2">any food or drink that is served on it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.180" end="00:50:19.900" style="s2">may spill onto an American flag and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.030" end="00:50:22.890" style="s2">just in high alert like fuck you who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.900" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">you and he comes in he&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.890" end="00:50:28.210" style="s2">attractive again over probably 20 to 23</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.040" style="s2">year old woman I think she&#39;s introduced</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.210" end="00:50:33.010" style="s2">as an heiress or something right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.040" end="00:50:35.319" style="s2">he&#39;s bouncing around as me in order to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.010" end="00:50:37.270" style="s2">get my attention there&#39;s some other guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.319" end="00:50:38.890" style="s2">says nothing during the meeting I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.270" end="00:50:40.839" style="s2">no idea what he was doing and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.890" end="00:50:43.089" style="s2">won detail I&#39;d like to add here in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.839" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">defense of the many people and the many</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.089" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">scientists who were in this guy&#39;s orbit</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:53.470" style="s2">and who didn&#39;t know how unseemly his</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:55.720" style="s2">life actually was some of these young</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.470" end="00:50:57.640" style="s2">women who you&#39;d meet in his company</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.720" end="00:50:59.020" style="s2">we&#39;re not just you know bimbos or</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.640" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">strippers or me that some of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.020" end="00:51:02.740" style="s2">people were going to medical school and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:06.309" style="s2">these were like smart young women well</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.740" end="00:51:07.269" style="s2">and identified incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.309" end="00:51:09.219" style="s2">distinction I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.269" end="00:51:12.069" style="s2">news media&#39;s done a good job of teasing</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.219" end="00:51:14.739" style="s2">it&#39;s very attached to the idea pedophile</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.069" end="00:51:17.409" style="s2">Island and Lolita Express right and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.739" end="00:51:19.569" style="s2">lazy sensationalist journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.409" end="00:51:22.779" style="s2">crowding something out which is that in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.569" end="00:51:26.259" style="s2">general from what I understand it so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.779" end="00:51:29.019" style="s2">met him in 2000 I think 2004 maybe 2003</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.259" end="00:51:30.419" style="s2">but before his Florida incarceration and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.019" end="00:51:33.159" style="s2">charges</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.419" end="00:51:36.819" style="s2">most people that I knew who met him met</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.159" end="00:51:40.359" style="s2">him with young adult women and so my</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.819" end="00:51:43.509" style="s2">theory is that he was constructed to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.359" end="00:51:46.899" style="s2">the sapiosexual Hugh Hefner right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.509" end="00:51:49.719" style="s2">that they stupidly hired probably and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.899" end="00:51:52.839" style="s2">guess I don&#39;t know this Humbert Humbert</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.719" end="00:51:57.779" style="s2">for the role and that that dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.839" end="00:52:00.279" style="s2">explains at least a lot of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.779" end="00:52:02.529" style="s2">willingness of the science community to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.279" end="00:52:03.699" style="s2">play with this person that I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.529" end="00:52:06.099" style="s2">be honest I&#39;m not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.699" end="00:52:08.829" style="s2">judgmental about consenting adults even</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.099" end="00:52:11.109" style="s2">if it&#39;s probably ill-advised you know to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.829" end="00:52:13.239" style="s2">have a 50-year spread between two people</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.109" end="00:52:15.219" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s 20 and somebody&#39;s 80 and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.239" end="00:52:16.509" style="s2">there&#39;s a completely different thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.219" end="00:52:20.529" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to see that if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.509" end="00:52:22.779" style="s2">seen this guy be sort of the womanizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.529" end="00:52:24.399" style="s2">schmuck right and within the bounds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.779" end="00:52:26.409" style="s2">you know total legality and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.399" end="00:52:28.389" style="s2">surrounded by 20 year-olds and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.409" end="00:52:29.799" style="s2">he&#39;s got a 40 year and everybody his</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.389" end="00:52:31.329" style="s2">party to the game and you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.799" end="00:52:33.189" style="s2">about money you whatever you would never</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.329" end="00:52:38.199" style="s2">suspect this other thing about him right</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.189" end="00:52:40.149" style="s2">okay so that is not a fair defense after</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.199" end="00:52:42.939" style="s2">the Florida situation the Florida</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.149" end="00:52:46.989" style="s2">situation changes that structure you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.939" end="00:52:48.639" style="s2">mean his his prosecution or well a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.989" end="00:52:51.069" style="s2">of Miami Herald thing that came out like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.639" end="00:52:53.679" style="s2">a lot a year ago no no the prosecution</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.069" end="00:52:56.169" style="s2">right so a lot of people continue to</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.779" end="00:57:49.829" style="s2">want to close the border what yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.329" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">first of all that&#39;s how country clubs</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.829" end="00:57:53.670" style="s2">work right right so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.079" style="s2">when you get a found with country club</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.670" end="00:57:56.249" style="s2">when you get into a country club you</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.609" end="00:58:07.079" style="s2">very weird thing for me that people who</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.099" end="00:58:08.549" style="s2">are very steeped in what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.079" end="00:58:11.930" style="s2">talking about which is this interesting</p>

<p begin="00:58:14.460" end="00:58:19.109" style="s2">of course we want the best people in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:22.019" style="s2">world to come to the u.s. selfishly I</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.109" end="00:58:24.210" style="s2">mean you know we&#39;re not everyone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.019" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">I mean the person who has to compete</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">Taiwan and China yeah that person let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.630" end="00:58:36.839" style="s2">say in in you know software engineering</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:39.019" style="s2">that person has fat it&#39;s now suddenly on</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.839" end="00:58:42.539" style="s2">a much more competitive playing field</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.019" end="00:58:44.549" style="s2">and yeah this is this is so what I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.539" end="00:58:46.170" style="s2">told about this I&#39;m just not I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.969" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">most of software is glorified foreign</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:40.289" style="s2">invoke a library you code up the class</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.609" end="00:59:42.329" style="s2">you can add source it yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.289" end="00:59:44.759" style="s2">well no it&#39;s just I&#39;m just saying that</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.759" end="00:59:48.150" style="s2">writing code yeah it&#39;s got a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.650" end="00:59:50.940" style="s2">mystique about it because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.150" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">people haven&#39;t done it and it&#39;s too</p>

<p begin="00:59:54.630" end="00:59:57.809" style="s2">science is plumbing yeah and so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.089" end="01:00:01.199" style="s2">the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.809" end="01:00:03.089" style="s2">the best is not very relevant if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.199" end="01:00:05.519" style="s2">wanted to take the stuff that&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.359" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">tiny number of people who are absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.900" end="01:00:24.119" style="s2">non-homogeneous super contributed so</p>

<p begin="01:00:24.119" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">bar higher I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.489" end="01:00:31.259" style="s2">saying a lot of different things one is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:34.199" style="s2">that people in the country have rights</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.259" end="01:00:36.239" style="s2">and they have asymmetric rights to their</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.199" end="01:00:37.499" style="s2">own labour market that&#39;s a large part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.239" end="01:00:40.289" style="s2">what it means to be a citizen of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.499" end="01:00:41.910" style="s2">country if I start to talk about your</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.289" end="01:00:44.130" style="s2">rights that are perhaps your most</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.910" end="01:00:45.509" style="s2">valuable economic possession if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.130" end="01:00:47.519" style="s2">really think about the American workers</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.509" end="01:00:50.039" style="s2">most valuable economic possession is</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.519" end="01:00:53.369" style="s2">asymmetric as access to the American</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.369" end="01:01:01.949" style="s2">right is not an asset but is instead an</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.660" end="01:01:03.269" style="s2">impediment it&#39;s a barrier and what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.949" end="01:01:05.549" style="s2">need to do is get rid of the red tape</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.269" end="01:01:08.999" style="s2">and I&#39;m not gonna pay you for it because</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.549" end="01:01:11.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not an asset I&#39;m going to take it</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.999" end="01:01:12.509" style="s2">from you and I&#39;m gonna say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.099" end="01:01:13.829" style="s2">what the free market is well that has</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.509" end="01:01:16.199" style="s2">nothing to do with the free market I</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.829" end="01:01:18.479" style="s2">wrote a paper called migration for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.199" end="01:01:21.959" style="s2">benefit of all mm-hmm that pointed out</p>

<p begin="01:01:21.959" end="01:01:26.489" style="s2">and pay for it right and then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.509" end="01:01:28.259" style="s2">wins yeah it&#39;s not what we do okay so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.489" end="01:01:30.059" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s something we could do</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.259" end="01:01:32.249" style="s2">though we could we are not in an</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.059" end="01:01:33.929" style="s2">economic that would be a Cosi and rice</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.249" end="01:01:35.939" style="s2">on right now it&#39;s called a Koshien</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.939" end="01:01:40.979" style="s2">it that the hysterically funny part</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.499" end="01:01:42.299" style="s2">about it is that no capitalists who</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.640" end="01:02:10.140" style="s2">referenced this several times over</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.170" end="01:02:11.340" style="s2">cocktails yeah in the last two years</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.140" end="01:02:13.380" style="s2">yeah well but</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.340" end="01:02:16.800" style="s2">my point this is because I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.380" end="01:02:20.990" style="s2">chatter no but I say sorry I see it</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.800" end="01:02:23.040" style="s2">differently same I see your comment that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.990" end="01:02:24.750" style="s2">well don&#39;t we want the best and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.040" end="01:02:26.250" style="s2">brightest where you don&#39;t reference wage</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.750" end="01:02:29.040" style="s2">competition it sounds more like</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.250" end="01:02:32.070" style="s2">intellectual competition right when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.040" end="01:02:35.070" style="s2">when you when you open a border and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.070" end="01:02:37.020" style="s2">selectively only in certain fields it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.070" end="01:02:39.450" style="s2">like opening a window in an airplane and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.020" end="01:02:41.070" style="s2">it specifically affects the seat at</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.450" end="01:02:42.810" style="s2">which it&#39;s opened differently than</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.070" end="01:02:46.320" style="s2">everywhere else in the plane right right</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.810" end="01:02:48.930" style="s2">so the the problem I have with this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.320" end="01:02:50.340" style="s2">that it&#39;s a large mimetic complex and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.930" end="01:02:52.980" style="s2">get it popping back up to the Jeff</p>

<p begin="01:02:52.980" end="01:02:58.820" style="s2">scientific complex was built on this</p>

<p begin="01:02:58.820" end="01:03:04.620" style="s2">right that is the thing that caused the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:06.570" style="s2">system to have to rescue itself with</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.620" end="01:03:09.270" style="s2">immigration so it&#39;s really not about</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.570" end="01:03:10.530" style="s2">immigration or brown people or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.270" end="01:03:13.110" style="s2">want to compete against the best in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.530" end="01:03:14.850" style="s2">brises the issue was we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.110" end="01:03:17.340" style="s2">enough people to feed into a pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.850" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">system and what you could do is you</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.340" end="01:03:21.120" style="s2">could you could reference a poverty</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.740" style="s2">differential between Asia which was</p>

<p begin="01:03:25.050" end="01:03:30.060" style="s2">level now that&#39;s changed some to fill in</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.020" end="01:03:31.560" style="s2">the bottom of the pyramid and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.060" end="01:03:33.720" style="s2">really what it was it was an economic</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.560" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">exponent that has nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.720" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">best and the brightest or the color of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:41.450" style="s2">one&#39;s skin it was just a way of saving a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:44.820" style="s2">pyramid scheme well so clearly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.450" end="01:03:47.070" style="s2">room for innovation on all these fronts</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.820" end="01:03:49.290" style="s2">and we should be eager to do it and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.070" end="01:03:50.730" style="s2">should be certainly eager to find Ponzi</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.290" end="01:03:52.140" style="s2">schemes that we didn&#39;t know where Ponzi</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.730" end="01:03:57.810" style="s2">schemes right like well yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.140" end="01:03:58.800" style="s2">it&#39;s we again this cut touches where we</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.810" end="01:04:02.220" style="s2">started when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.800" end="01:04:03.300" style="s2">Samantha power and other and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.220" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">Southern Poverty Law Center I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.300" end="01:04:08.940" style="s2">there there are systems we set up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:10.890" style="s2">the best of intentions and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.940" end="01:04:13.620" style="s2">projects and and meme you know mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.890" end="01:04:15.960" style="s2">complexes we launched you know upon the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.620" end="01:04:19.290" style="s2">world with the best of intentions and we</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.960" end="01:04:21.150" style="s2">don&#39;t see the way incentives will align</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.290" end="01:04:24.780" style="s2">or though or they you know the knock-on</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.150" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">effects or the externalities of doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.780" end="01:04:27.090" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:28.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s just the world is more</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.090" end="01:04:31.230" style="s2">complicated than we realize well and</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.890" end="01:04:32.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what was so that&#39;s like the thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.230" end="01:04:34.350" style="s2">that scares me a little bit remember I</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.490" end="01:04:36.150" style="s2">said that I have malware in my head yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.350" end="01:04:37.290" style="s2">my belief is is that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.150" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">beautiful things that you were thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.290" end="01:04:40.230" style="s2">about about being open to the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:41.850" style="s2">training the best and the brightest</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.230" end="01:04:43.860" style="s2">keeping some of them for ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.850" end="01:04:45.390" style="s2">distributing some of them back home to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.860" end="01:04:45.980" style="s2">grow the pie for everyone at cetera et</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.390" end="01:04:48.870" style="s2">cetera</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.980" end="01:04:50.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a memetic complex that I I</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.870" end="01:04:52.770" style="s2">associate with malware it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.730" end="01:04:54.660" style="s2">there aren&#39;t aspects of it was moved but</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.770" end="01:04:56.460" style="s2">I think it&#39;s close to the right program</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.660" end="01:04:59.970" style="s2">so for instance you know like if you say</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.460" end="01:05:06.110" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s the fact that I am NOT</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.970" end="01:05:06.110" style="s2">thinking when I say that about the I</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.140" end="01:05:14.100" style="s2">forget how you put it but the may be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.120" end="01:05:17.040" style="s2">difference between the local case and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.100" end="01:05:18.900" style="s2">the imported case right you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.040" end="01:05:21.360" style="s2">but by analogy you know opening the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.900" end="01:05:23.070" style="s2">window on the airplane or just the fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.360" end="01:05:26.580" style="s2">that you know that you you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.070" end="01:05:29.580" style="s2">here who are paying taxes to help build</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.580" end="01:05:31.650" style="s2">out local infrastructure that some then</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.580" end="01:05:34.650" style="s2">some Titan of industry is going to</p>

<p begin="01:05:52.470" end="01:05:59.280" style="s2">all these people pushed out this idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.220" end="01:06:02.490" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t know how to how to oppose</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.280" end="01:06:05.130" style="s2">it but what they were doing was allowing</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.490" end="01:06:07.560" style="s2">a slice of our country to continue to</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.130" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">grow its slices of the pie</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.560" end="01:06:16.050" style="s2">mm-hmm but again it&#39;s just easy to find</p>

<p begin="01:06:20.880" end="01:06:25.890" style="s2">another example which which I think is</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.890" end="01:06:28.350" style="s2">you&#39;re totally familiar with but well</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.890" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">seem less sinister or at least it seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.350" end="01:06:31.590" style="s2">so to me so you take what happened to</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:34.440" style="s2">the music industry right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.590" end="01:06:37.290" style="s2">you we have a a breakthrough in</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.440" end="01:06:38.660" style="s2">technology we go from vinyl to CDs and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.290" end="01:06:41.660" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.660" end="01:06:46.099" style="s2">you know we suffer those jewel cases for</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.660" end="01:06:50.150" style="s2">about a decade and then we get pamphlet</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.099" end="01:06:52.250" style="s2">threes which open the door to piracy of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.150" end="01:06:54.680" style="s2">a sort no one has anticipated and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.250" end="01:06:56.150" style="s2">we managed to close down the piracy we</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.680" end="01:06:59.269" style="s2">have the you know the iTunes Store and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.150" end="01:07:01.700" style="s2">people are but but because of this this</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.269" end="01:07:05.329" style="s2">explosion of piracy and now the prospect</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.700" end="01:07:06.829" style="s2">of just you know now it&#39;s all bits it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.329" end="01:07:10.910" style="s2">not atoms anymore</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.829" end="01:07:13.730" style="s2">we have a just a fundamental devaluation</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.910" end="01:07:15.380" style="s2">of the product rightly the music then</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.730" end="01:07:18.019" style="s2">the music the value of the music has</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.380" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">basically gone to zero right because my</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.019" end="01:07:22.130" style="s2">using a copy of it is not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:24.170" style="s2">taking two things</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.130" end="01:07:26.569" style="s2">it&#39;s an exhaust ability and</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.170" end="01:07:31.250" style="s2">excludability right ideas that if I buy</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.569" end="01:07:33.140" style="s2">a vinyl record one my use of it will</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.250" end="01:07:35.029" style="s2">eventually wear down the grooves that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.140" end="01:07:36.680" style="s2">used to do in the old days and to my</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.029" end="01:07:39.079" style="s2">having the record means that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.680" end="01:07:42.140" style="s2">have a probably yeah and that the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.079" end="01:07:45.380" style="s2">per the unit cost is not just I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.140" end="01:07:47.599" style="s2">copy your record for free yeah that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.380" end="01:07:49.609" style="s2">this issue about private goods and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:51.019" style="s2">services became public goods and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.609" end="01:07:53.210" style="s2">services and even the die-hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.019" end="01:07:54.920" style="s2">economists who a free-market have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.210" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">recognize that if something is</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.920" end="01:07:58.970" style="s2">inexhaustible and an excludable price</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:01.849" style="s2">does not equal value and therefore it</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.970" end="01:08:04.369" style="s2">cannot command its value so that was</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.849" end="01:08:06.740" style="s2">clear to many of us just as but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.369" end="01:08:08.869" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a non nefarious account</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.740" end="01:08:12.109" style="s2">of what happened there where your iTunes</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.869" end="01:08:13.849" style="s2">right your Apple you open iTunes for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.109" end="01:08:15.049" style="s2">good of all right bu you obviously want</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.849" end="01:08:17.960" style="s2">to make a profit right this is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.049" end="01:08:20.810" style="s2">fantastic business but what when if</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.960" end="01:08:24.139" style="s2">you&#39;re the musician right now who&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.810" end="01:08:25.730" style="s2">whose catalog is now worth you know one</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.139" end="01:08:29.420" style="s2">tenth of what it used to be worth and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.730" end="01:08:31.580" style="s2">now you&#39;re you have this sort of life</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.420" end="01:08:33.109" style="s2">change foisted on you we&#39;re now the only</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.580" end="01:08:35.810" style="s2">way for you to make ends meet is to tour</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.109" end="01:08:37.400" style="s2">but you&#39;re you know 70 years old and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.810" end="01:08:40.279" style="s2">you know you felt your touring was</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.400" end="01:08:43.460" style="s2">behind you right all of this looks awful</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.279" end="01:08:44.719" style="s2">but again nobody was thinking about that</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.460" end="01:08:48.409" style="s2">guy when they when these changes</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.719" end="01:08:50.659" style="s2">bullshit well it&#39;s easy to see that most</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.409" end="01:08:51.190" style="s2">people weren&#39;t thinking where no one no</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.659" end="01:08:52.810" style="s2">one had</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.190" end="01:08:54.759" style="s2">and intentions toward that remember</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.810" end="01:08:58.690" style="s2">information just wants to be free and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.759" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">free like beer and all that I thought</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.690" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">that stuff was just like moronic at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:08.020" style="s2">time the same thing with NAFTA right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:10.330" style="s2">claim not it began so what you had in</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.020" end="01:09:12.339" style="s2">your sights was not you can&#39;t yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.330" end="01:09:15.400" style="s2">don&#39;t think you&#39;re the wrong theory of</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.339" end="01:09:18.100" style="s2">mind if you think everyone was aware of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.400" end="01:09:20.650" style="s2">what you were aware of and just had the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.100" end="01:09:24.520" style="s2">same ethical no switch flipped in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.650" end="01:09:27.430" style="s2">other direction the class the economic</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.520" end="01:09:31.569" style="s2">class teaches public goods in every econ</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.430" end="01:09:34.029" style="s2">101 textbook right they also teach trade</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.569" end="01:09:39.239" style="s2">they have two different names for what</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.029" end="01:09:42.850" style="s2">happens to improve a society in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.239" end="01:09:44.529" style="s2">how its measured one called Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.850" end="01:09:47.529" style="s2">improvement which is that everybody in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.529" end="01:09:50.109" style="s2">the society is as good or better off and</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.529" end="01:09:51.969" style="s2">the other one called Caldor Hicks which</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.109" end="01:09:55.330" style="s2">is some people get hurt some people get</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.969" end="01:09:57.370" style="s2">helped but were you to tax the winners</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.330" end="01:10:00.820" style="s2">to pay the losers everyone Getty Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.370" end="01:10:05.320" style="s2">improved okay when you ask these people</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.820" end="01:10:08.260" style="s2">in real time why are you talking about a</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.320" end="01:10:10.770" style="s2">Kaldor Hicks improvement in Pareto term</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.260" end="01:10:13.530" style="s2">so this is the technical esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.770" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">conversation why is your exoteric</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.530" end="01:10:18.969" style="s2">description of this at odds with your</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:21.870" style="s2">esoteric alright this is pure Strauss</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.969" end="01:10:24.219" style="s2">e&#39;en cryptic bullshit mmm</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.870" end="01:10:26.170" style="s2">they said well we can&#39;t really say that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.219" end="01:10:29.469" style="s2">and we hope that somebody it&#39;s not our</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.170" end="01:10:31.900" style="s2">job it was this wall of total nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.469" end="01:10:35.110" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t that this wasn&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.900" end="01:10:37.180" style="s2">said in real time what the number of</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.110" end="01:10:41.469" style="s2">people I&#39;m sure you can find the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.180" end="01:10:42.880" style="s2">at the conference who were I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.469" end="01:10:45.160" style="s2">you know they have they have one way of</p>

<p begin="01:10:45.160" end="01:10:49.690" style="s2">of speaking on the York Times is one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.130" end="01:10:52.180" style="s2">the reasons why you and I split on this</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.690" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">seem to leb I stood shoulder-to-shoulder</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.180" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">with the seam during the total nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:11:01.690" style="s2">called the Great Moderation in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">financial structure in before 2008 and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.690" end="01:11:05.080" style="s2">this I the only reason why I&#39;ve split on</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.000" end="01:11:06.940" style="s2">the seam is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.080" end="01:11:09.550" style="s2">he just wakes up one morning and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.940" end="01:11:11.380" style="s2">know off his meds and attacks me for</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.550" end="01:11:12.970" style="s2">reasons I can never but it&#39;s NASM would</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.380" end="01:11:14.500" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s totally personal like</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.970" end="01:11:15.910" style="s2">oh it&#39;s um it&#39;s intended to be personal</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.500" end="01:11:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not that I take it personally I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.910" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.200" end="01:11:21.130" style="s2">intended or be personal but he can</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:22.540" style="s2">correct me on that but it&#39;s apropos of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.130" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">nothing like I&#39;ve been you know I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.150" end="01:12:14.410" style="s2">around things that are much larger than</p>

<p begin="01:12:14.410" end="01:12:17.200" style="s2">don&#39;t I&#39;m not saying that he does</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:19.390" style="s2">everything well I obviously have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.200" end="01:12:20.860" style="s2">totally different tack than he does so</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.390" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">I&#39;m very uncomfortable with his methods</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.860" end="01:12:25.470" style="s2">but let&#39;s at least say what they are and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:28.690" style="s2">steel man it to the extent possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.470" end="01:12:32.860" style="s2">other people say you you you Joe are</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.690" end="01:12:35.160" style="s2">misusing statistics nassim would say</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.860" end="01:12:38.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with statistics</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.160" end="01:12:40.600" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s constructed to be misused</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.470" end="01:12:43.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s misused all the time in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.600" end="01:12:44.650" style="s2">same way and if you do anything that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.240" end="01:12:46.990" style="s2">were normally taught to do in statistics</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.650" end="01:12:48.610" style="s2">class if you have a PhD in statistics</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.990" end="01:12:51.490" style="s2">you&#39;re part of the problem and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.610" end="01:12:54.960" style="s2">hold you personally responsible now this</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.490" end="01:12:57.700" style="s2">is very disconcerting to people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.960" end="01:13:00.700" style="s2">except I mean I I don&#39;t think we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.700" end="01:13:03.310" style="s2">spend a lot of time on this but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.700" end="01:13:05.380" style="s2">they&#39;re areas where I am not qualified</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.310" end="01:13:07.150" style="s2">to fact-check him throughout the areas</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.380" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">where I am where his opinions are just</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.150" end="01:13:12.850" style="s2">as strident it&#39;s just just a deluge of</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:15.390" style="s2">bullshit coming from him so like you</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.850" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">know the stuff he has said about</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.390" end="01:13:18.820" style="s2">religion and science is not even I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:21.250" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.820" end="01:13:23.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not even wrong it&#39;s like its</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.250" end="01:13:26.980" style="s2">incoherent it&#39;s not like he&#39;s got a a</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.880" end="01:13:28.690" style="s2">counterpoint that I still think is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.980" end="01:13:30.880" style="s2">but you know it has to be argued again</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.690" end="01:13:33.460" style="s2">look I&#39;ve got just this vomitus look</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.880" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten there too I can&#39;t stand the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.460" end="01:13:39.219" style="s2">style because it just hurts me like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.159" end="01:13:40.540" style="s2">very uncomfortable by it however there</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.219" end="01:13:43.420" style="s2">are plenty of times when I thought he</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.540" end="01:13:44.860" style="s2">was talking nonsense that like at first</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.420" end="01:13:46.389" style="s2">it sounds like he&#39;s making a sensible</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.860" end="01:13:48.340" style="s2">objection then I&#39;m just like convinced</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.389" end="01:13:49.630" style="s2">this he&#39;s going off the rails and then I</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.340" end="01:13:52.840" style="s2">pushed further and it turns out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.630" end="01:13:57.070" style="s2">even more of a point so I have learned</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.840" end="01:13:59.920" style="s2">to be very cautious around him not</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.070" end="01:14:02.320" style="s2">because he&#39;s the person you want around</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.920" end="01:14:03.969" style="s2">for most of the time but when we were in</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.320" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">the middle of the Great Moderation</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.969" end="01:14:09.190" style="s2">and I I punked out because I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:12.790" style="s2">with him and I was giving talks about</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.190" end="01:14:14.679" style="s2">Epstein and Madoff there was a -</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.790" end="01:14:17.020" style="s2">mysterious functions in New York right</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.679" end="01:14:19.570" style="s2">and I used to put slides up about black</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.020" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">arts capital it was sort of a play on</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.570" end="01:14:24.310" style="s2">like black stone or black rock and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:27.820" style="s2">idea is we tell you what we&#39;re doing but</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.310" end="01:14:30.219" style="s2">we&#39;d have to kill you right the we we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.820" end="01:14:31.389" style="s2">just didn&#39;t know and I got Madoff wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.219" end="01:14:33.040" style="s2">I thought he was front-running his</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.389" end="01:14:34.020" style="s2">legitimate business which attorney that</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.040" end="01:14:37.119" style="s2">was just a Ponzi scheme</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.020" end="01:14:38.500" style="s2">but I knew Epstein was very likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.119" end="01:14:41.260" style="s2">something totally other than he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.500" end="01:14:43.690" style="s2">nassim during this period of time that</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.260" end="01:14:45.449" style="s2">we were both discussing the nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.690" end="01:14:46.650" style="s2">that was the supposed Great Moderation</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.449" end="01:14:49.900" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.650" end="01:14:51.849" style="s2">was the other guy who would take as much</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.900" end="01:14:53.949" style="s2">punishment as the community would throw</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.849" end="01:14:56.170" style="s2">at him and they were just humiliated</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.949" end="01:14:58.329" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh he made one lucky trade in</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.170" end="01:15:01.179" style="s2">1987 the guy&#39;s an idiot he&#39;s a blowhard</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.329" end="01:15:03.099" style="s2">he&#39;s a fool and I couldn&#39;t take the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.179" end="01:15:05.440" style="s2">pressure from giving this talk that</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.099" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">obviously we hadn&#39;t banished volatility</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.440" end="01:15:10.179" style="s2">and I think around 2005 I was about</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:12.730" style="s2">three years in and the sium says you</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.179" end="01:15:15.510" style="s2">know you&#39;re gonna regret getting out of</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.730" end="01:15:19.810" style="s2">this early you should see it through and</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.510" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">it always stuck with me that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.810" end="01:15:25.210" style="s2">quite have the courage or the strength</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:26.650" style="s2">or the guts of the disagree ability to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.210" end="01:15:28.690" style="s2">continue at least to hold the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.650" end="01:15:30.219" style="s2">intellectual position I couldn&#39;t time</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.690" end="01:15:31.630" style="s2">when this thing was gonna blow but it</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.219" end="01:15:32.290" style="s2">was you know I wrote this thing on</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.630" end="01:15:34.530" style="s2">mortgage</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.290" end="01:15:37.210" style="s2">back securities with Adil Abdul Ali in</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.530" end="01:15:39.730" style="s2">2001 mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.210" end="01:15:41.530" style="s2">this was nonsense and it was a world in</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.730" end="01:15:45.070" style="s2">which almost no one was willing to call</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.530" end="01:15:48.940" style="s2">it out and so the singularity in my in</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.070" end="01:15:50.740" style="s2">my world about Nasim has to do with he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.940" end="01:15:53.350" style="s2">willing to be one person against</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.740" end="01:15:56.320" style="s2">billions he will he will literally just</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.350" end="01:15:58.870" style="s2">stand up against any crowd okay well so</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.320" end="01:16:00.220" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s often a bug and you found</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.870" end="01:16:02.890" style="s2">the one case perhaps where it was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.220" end="01:16:04.570" style="s2">feature but it&#39;s I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.890" end="01:16:07.060" style="s2">we&#39;re all like that to some degree I</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.570" end="01:16:10.390" style="s2">mean we&#39;re all standing up her on me</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.060" end="01:16:11.860" style="s2">right and yeah but I mean III do it you</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.390" end="01:16:15.460" style="s2">do it but yeah you don&#39;t get weak-kneed</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.860" end="01:16:18.970" style="s2">I get weak-kneed what yeah occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.460" end="01:16:21.250" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s there is a kind I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.970" end="01:16:23.680" style="s2">again I&#39;m and not to psychoanalyze him</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.250" end="01:16:27.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s a sort of trumpian</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.680" end="01:16:28.990" style="s2">level personality problem layered on top</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.040" end="01:16:30.460" style="s2">of his intellect where I&#39;m not disputing</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.990" end="01:16:32.620" style="s2">the guy is smart he said there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.460" end="01:16:34.630" style="s2">question he&#39;s smart but there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.620" end="01:16:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;s so much personality to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.630" end="01:16:39.010" style="s2">through and wrangle with to interact</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.640" end="01:16:41.410" style="s2">with whatever whatever smarts are</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.010" end="01:16:43.870" style="s2">showing up for depending on the topic</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.410" end="01:16:45.820" style="s2">and again with some topics you know I</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.870" end="01:16:47.860" style="s2">haven&#39;t found the smarts but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.820" end="01:16:51.160" style="s2">disputing that the guy obviously he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.860" end="01:16:53.410" style="s2">intelligent it&#39;s just he&#39;s so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.160" end="01:16:55.720" style="s2">one more enamored of his intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.410" end="01:16:58.240" style="s2">than him right and it&#39;s just it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.720" end="01:17:01.650" style="s2">that level of egocentricity again it has</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.240" end="01:17:05.470" style="s2">a kind of trumpian you know peacock fan</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.650" end="01:17:08.770" style="s2">quality to it and in in the cases where</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.470" end="01:17:10.810" style="s2">it&#39;s warranted it&#39;s still extra and his</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.770" end="01:17:13.150" style="s2">bullshit and it&#39;s annoying when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.810" end="01:17:16.660" style="s2">unwarranted it&#39;s embarrassing and he has</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.150" end="01:17:18.820" style="s2">zero sense of where he is on that scale</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.660" end="01:17:21.250" style="s2">I hear what you&#39;re saying I do have the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.820" end="01:17:23.500" style="s2">sense of the number of floorboards that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.250" end="01:17:24.970" style="s2">I can hide under when the storm troopers</p>

<p begin="01:18:14.270" end="01:18:24.320" style="s2">can have good effects of bad intentions</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:25.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s and you shouldn&#39;t neglect too</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.320" end="01:18:30.950" style="s2">highly there you know because like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.970" end="01:18:32.630" style="s2">the I think intentions matter for the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.950" end="01:18:34.250" style="s2">most part I mean tensions are the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.630" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">operating system so because like if</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.250" end="01:18:38.540" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re iterating on your</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:41.270" style="s2">intentions if you&#39;re if you&#39;re error</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.540" end="01:18:43.730" style="s2">correcting right and cueing back to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.270" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">the the outcomes you actually want right</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.730" end="01:18:47.090" style="s2">that is those are the people we can</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:49.520" style="s2">collaborate with it you know when</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.090" end="01:18:51.320" style="s2">they&#39;re when they&#39;re ethical the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.520" end="01:18:53.680" style="s2">people who are right by accident or</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.320" end="01:18:56.540" style="s2">producing good things by accident are</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.680" end="01:18:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s how it&#39;s how we encode this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.540" end="01:19:01.220" style="s2">so interesting to me like when we order</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.850" end="01:19:02.540" style="s2">veal we just saved the word via we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.220" end="01:19:04.790" style="s2">think about what it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.540" end="01:19:06.470" style="s2">causing to a current I want that I want</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.790" end="01:19:08.540" style="s2">the three-minute video before I eat the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.470" end="01:19:12.050" style="s2">veal exactly right like very few of us</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.540" end="01:19:14.150" style="s2">do that when I think about like how</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.050" end="01:19:15.890" style="s2">Debbie Wasel that&#39;s why I don&#39;t order</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.150" end="01:19:17.240" style="s2">veal right that&#39;s a difference at a</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.890" end="01:19:19.310" style="s2">certain point</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.240" end="01:19:21.260" style="s2">too much information has a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.310" end="01:19:24.710" style="s2">right like I I&#39;m not comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.260" end="01:19:28.130" style="s2">veal or foie gras right yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.710" end="01:19:29.960" style="s2">like if and it would matter if you said</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.130" end="01:19:32.120" style="s2">well here&#39;s veal but this is veal this</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.960" end="01:19:34.310" style="s2">is pain-free veal right this is veal</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.120" end="01:19:37.160" style="s2">that was you know synthesized in a lab</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.310" end="01:19:40.310" style="s2">no animals involved the the problem goes</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.160" end="01:19:42.290" style="s2">away so that&#39;s that that&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.310" end="01:19:44.900" style="s2">there&#39;s you&#39;d want there to be a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.290" end="01:19:47.540" style="s2">difference there you wouldn&#39;t we well</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.900" end="01:19:51.260" style="s2">take the most extreme case you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.540" end="01:19:54.200" style="s2">want to be the person who would pay more</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.260" end="01:19:56.660" style="s2">for the veal if you knew there was more</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.200" end="01:19:57.980" style="s2">so suffering associated with it rightly</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.660" end="01:19:58.320" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t what we wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.980" end="01:19:59.910" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.320" end="01:20:01.770" style="s2">the per it would be the person who for</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.910" end="01:20:04.140" style="s2">whom the suffering is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.770" end="01:20:08.640" style="s2">pleasure right</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.140" end="01:20:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s see there that&#39;s clearly a place</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.640" end="01:20:12.060" style="s2">on the moral landscape you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.500" end="01:20:14.040" style="s2">be and yeah and you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.060" end="01:20:17.160" style="s2">associated with right so if that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.040" end="01:20:20.730" style="s2">all unsavory then there&#39;s there many</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.160" end="01:20:22.440" style="s2">gradations of better than that right so</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.730" end="01:20:25.370" style="s2">let&#39;s get back to my issue about orcas</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.440" end="01:20:29.460" style="s2">are either the best or worst species</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.370" end="01:20:32.550" style="s2">yeah nobody I didn&#39;t mean to derail yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.460" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">but it matters like we need to unpack</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.550" end="01:20:38.700" style="s2">the mimetic complex and get it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.480" end="01:20:40.710" style="s2">inside and it matters if we if we fail</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.700" end="01:20:42.450" style="s2">to it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot inside and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.710" end="01:20:46.170" style="s2">unaware of it sure know that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.450" end="01:20:48.630" style="s2">matters okay how often are we just</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.170" end="01:20:51.060" style="s2">saying veal but a very lower example</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.630" end="01:20:52.410" style="s2">what I remember when Debbie</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.060" end="01:20:54.180" style="s2">wasserman-schultz was being interviewed</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.410" end="01:20:55.700" style="s2">about super-delegates and she said</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.180" end="01:20:58.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not super-delegates their</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.700" end="01:21:00.450" style="s2">unpledged delegates and delegates and</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.440" end="01:21:02.070" style="s2">why do we have to have them and I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.450" end="01:21:03.380" style="s2">she said something to the effect and if</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.070" end="01:21:06.500" style="s2">I&#39;m getting this wrong I apologize</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.380" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">something like well you wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.500" end="01:21:12.660" style="s2">the the people who aren&#39;t regular party</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:14.550" style="s2">workers you know just being able to take</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.660" end="01:21:16.290" style="s2">over the party something like this I was</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.550" end="01:21:18.330" style="s2">thinking oh that&#39;s what we all think it</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.290" end="01:21:19.850" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a primary and that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.330" end="01:21:21.930" style="s2">people who were registered Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.850" end="01:21:23.610" style="s2">should figure out who they should</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.930" end="01:21:24.810" style="s2">support as a candidate her point was</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.610" end="01:21:26.580" style="s2">what we have to have a thumb on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.810" end="01:21:30.900" style="s2">scale otherwise democracy might happen</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.580" end="01:21:36.750" style="s2">right yeah and like that thing is how we</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.900" end="01:21:39.030" style="s2">encode the badness we encode it by</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.750" end="01:21:41.880" style="s2">creating some different way of talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.030" end="01:21:44.160" style="s2">about it how we encode it or we fail to</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.880" end="01:21:46.680" style="s2">encode it how it becomes operable or how</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.160" end="01:21:49.500" style="s2">well nobody&#39;s a bad person in their own</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.680" end="01:21:53.340" style="s2">mind most of the time yeah most so when</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.500" end="01:21:55.380" style="s2">I do bad things I encode it differently</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.340" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">so we were just in a in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.380" end="01:22:02.670" style="s2">where we were waiting in a very long</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:04.980" style="s2">line of cars for an off-ramp and our car</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.670" end="01:22:07.830" style="s2">you know sort of zoomed ahead and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.980" end="01:22:10.309" style="s2">asks somebody&#39;s you know understanding</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.830" end="01:22:12.260" style="s2">we would cut in right towards the exit</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.309" end="01:22:13.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re sort of high-fiving like cheese</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.260" end="01:22:14.989" style="s2">we almost got caught in that really long</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.520" end="01:22:17.570" style="s2">line later in the day</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.989" end="01:22:20.809" style="s2">somebody cuts in front of us much less</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.570" end="01:22:23.119" style="s2">of it yeah probably can you believe that</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.809" end="01:22:25.489" style="s2">guy and so this this way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.119" end="01:22:27.559" style="s2">sort of see ourselves the permanent like</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.489" end="01:22:29.770" style="s2">good guy protagonist in the first case</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.559" end="01:22:34.280" style="s2">being savvy yeah but so don&#39;t you think</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.770" end="01:22:36.489" style="s2">living a good life is in large measure a</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.280" end="01:22:39.050" style="s2">matter of</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.489" end="01:22:40.909" style="s2">squeezing the the Delta between those</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.050" end="01:22:42.889" style="s2">two states among you think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.909" end="01:22:45.199" style="s2">true yeah that&#39;s why it was a leading</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.889" end="01:22:47.960" style="s2">question I know I know but I think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.199" end="01:22:51.289" style="s2">it&#39;s actually much more tricky um so</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.960" end="01:22:52.760" style="s2">let&#39;s take the the antithesis what if I</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.289" end="01:22:55.789" style="s2">told you that I thought it was a matter</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.760" end="01:22:58.219" style="s2">of getting broadening that Gulf right so</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.789" end="01:23:00.920" style="s2">to be more extremely at odds with</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.219" end="01:23:02.809" style="s2">oneself depending on what side of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.920" end="01:23:04.280" style="s2">table you&#39;re on and those I think you</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.809" end="01:23:07.250" style="s2">would have been less likely to cut in</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.280" end="01:23:09.380" style="s2">line mm-hm but if you did cut in line I</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.250" end="01:23:11.150" style="s2">wonder if you&#39;d be less likely to notice</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.380" end="01:23:13.190" style="s2">it and talk about it the way I do so I</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.150" end="01:23:14.809" style="s2">think that your morality and my morality</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.190" end="01:23:16.219" style="s2">differs slightly I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.809" end="01:23:17.510" style="s2">giving me and you&#39;re giving us seem to</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.219" end="01:23:21.199" style="s2">lab to much credit and you&#39;re not giving</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.510" end="01:23:22.789" style="s2">me enough those right so so I am well</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.199" end="01:23:26.449" style="s2">she was pretty consistent in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.789" end="01:23:29.480" style="s2">ways yeah what I aspire to be is to to</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.449" end="01:23:32.179" style="s2">cut in line the right amount okay and to</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.480" end="01:23:34.039" style="s2">be appropriately non-judgmental when I</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.179" end="01:23:35.869" style="s2">see someone else cut in line right</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.039" end="01:23:39.440" style="s2">that&#39;s very odd I&#39;m pretty close to that</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.869" end="01:23:43.789" style="s2">yeah I mean I so I don&#39;t have too many</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.440" end="01:23:45.770" style="s2">illusions about what it is to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.789" end="01:23:48.500" style="s2">what and but what it is when somebody</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.770" end="01:23:50.449" style="s2">else does it so I don&#39;t I&#39;m not as and</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.500" end="01:23:52.940" style="s2">when I catchment when I occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.449" end="01:23:56.750" style="s2">catch myself in that that mismatch</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.940" end="01:23:58.579" style="s2">between you know who I&#39;m capable of</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.750" end="01:24:00.260" style="s2">being in one moment and how judgmental I</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.579" end="01:24:05.539" style="s2">am of somebody else in that same mode</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.260" end="01:24:08.449" style="s2">noticing your own sort of issues makes</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.539" end="01:24:11.329" style="s2">you a better person if you can port them</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.449" end="01:24:15.380" style="s2">more generally so in other words if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.329" end="01:24:17.329" style="s2">say look I I recognize that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.380" end="01:24:20.900" style="s2">not the I&#39;m not the best around food or</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.329" end="01:24:23.420" style="s2">something but yeah I am very conscious</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.900" end="01:24:28.130" style="s2">in some other area like being timely</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.420" end="01:24:30.320" style="s2">well if you can recognize somehow</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.130" end="01:24:32.210" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s failings as akin to your</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.320" end="01:24:35.540" style="s2">own in a different area and port that</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.210" end="01:24:39.020" style="s2">right that&#39;s a way in which like being</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.540" end="01:24:40.670" style="s2">in touch with your own hypocrisy I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.020" end="01:24:41.960" style="s2">makes you a better person and I worry</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.670" end="01:24:44.449" style="s2">about people who are trying to rid</p>

<p begin="01:24:49.010" end="01:24:55.250" style="s2">garish but yeah but to be to truly want</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.300" end="01:24:56.600" style="s2">to minimize it you have to be in touch</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.250" end="01:24:59.239" style="s2">with it right so there&#39;s nothing you run</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.679" end="01:25:05.440" style="s2">think it&#39;s more like I don&#39;t see any</p>

<p begin="01:25:05.440" end="01:25:08.810" style="s2">other people say oh I caught something I</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.730" end="01:25:12.080" style="s2">have to get rid of it you know it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:25:14.300" end="01:25:19.400" style="s2">with that we because you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.060" end="01:25:21.380" style="s2">unitary thing right like you aren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.400" end="01:25:23.510" style="s2">unitary thing right and most of us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.380" end="01:25:25.190" style="s2">even though we know that we still treat</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.510" end="01:25:29.420" style="s2">ourselves as unitary things which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.190" end="01:25:31.160" style="s2">bizarre yeah well you&#39;re you&#39;re in it I</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.420" end="01:25:33.469" style="s2">work hard not to do that I yeah but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.160" end="01:25:34.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have an app and I don&#39;t do do</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.469" end="01:25:36.380" style="s2">these practices but I&#39;m still very</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.790" end="01:25:38.900" style="s2">conscious of that the fact that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.380" end="01:25:41.000" style="s2">I&#39;m not unit area know that I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.900" end="01:25:42.469" style="s2">if you follow that a little bit further</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.000" end="01:25:44.780" style="s2">that becomes very interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.469" end="01:25:47.870" style="s2">you&#39;re not eight but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.780" end="01:25:50.060" style="s2">you there&#39;s not there&#39;s no norm you want</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.870" end="01:25:55.010" style="s2">to to aspire to follow right like you</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.060" end="01:25:57.350" style="s2">can be there are phases of your mind you</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.010" end="01:25:59.030" style="s2">can prefer to others and you and you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.350" end="01:26:01.610" style="s2">and there&#39;s also something that happens</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.030" end="01:26:04.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you cease to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.610" end="01:26:05.780" style="s2">in by your your different selves and all</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.280" end="01:26:08.239" style="s2">these different modes right to the to</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.780" end="01:26:12.679" style="s2">the normal degree then you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.239" end="01:26:14.860" style="s2">then there&#39;s a kind of freedom to to</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.679" end="01:26:17.660" style="s2">navigate to it to a kind of a happier</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.860" end="01:26:18.949" style="s2">but confrontation but there is some way</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.660" end="01:26:20.719" style="s2">in which what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.949" end="01:26:23.810" style="s2">that one of your Parliament&#39;s of selves</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.719" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">is that your meta self which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.810" end="01:26:29.179" style="s2">probably getting as close to identifying</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:34.100" style="s2">with unitarity as anything else well</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.179" end="01:26:36.949" style="s2">it&#39;s just there is in the morning the</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.100" end="01:26:37.409" style="s2">subroutines you would probably call Sam</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.949" end="01:26:40.050" style="s2">Harris</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.409" end="01:26:41.280" style="s2">well would a it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.050" end="01:26:42.630" style="s2">diaphanous and that may ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.280" end="01:26:44.519" style="s2">stress consciousness I mean the only</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.630" end="01:26:46.139" style="s2">thing that can supervise anything is or</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.519" end="01:26:48.059" style="s2">be aware of anything or experience</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.139" end="01:26:50.189" style="s2">anything is what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.059" end="01:26:52.349" style="s2">consciousness now that&#39;s not when you</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.189" end="01:26:55.320" style="s2">really pay attention to what that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.349" end="01:26:57.150" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually answer to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.320" end="01:26:58.709" style="s2">name I or me I mean it really it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.150" end="01:27:00.630" style="s2">it&#39;s just this open space in which</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.709" end="01:27:02.849" style="s2">everything&#39;s appearing including</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.630" end="01:27:06.949" style="s2">thoughts and intentions and desires and</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.849" end="01:27:11.159" style="s2">emotions and there it really is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.949" end="01:27:13.050" style="s2">cacophony but the cacophony changes the</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.159" end="01:27:17.090" style="s2">more you fall back to this position of</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.050" end="01:27:22.409" style="s2">just witnessing the show right and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.090" end="01:27:24.209" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re you&#39;re I get</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.409" end="01:27:26.489" style="s2">that make one analogy that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.209" end="01:27:29.369" style="s2">fairly apropos is the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.489" end="01:27:31.349" style="s2">dreaming and lucid dreaming right the</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.369" end="01:27:32.789" style="s2">more you lucid dream the more you</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.349" end="01:27:34.380" style="s2">actually can kind of change your dreams</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.789" end="01:27:36.689" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s what it is the point yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.380" end="01:27:38.610" style="s2">but it&#39;s like but you&#39;re still you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.689" end="01:27:43.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a consequence to being lucid and</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.610" end="01:27:48.090" style="s2">in your end being perpetually lost in</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.320" end="01:27:49.800" style="s2">thought being prepared of noticing not</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.090" end="01:27:51.989" style="s2">noticing thought as thought being</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.800" end="01:27:55.800" style="s2">identified with every intention that</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.989" end="01:27:58.110" style="s2">that surfaces in the mind is really</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.800" end="01:27:59.369" style="s2">deeply analogous to be to being asleep</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.110" end="01:28:00.630" style="s2">and dreaming and not knowing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.369" end="01:28:02.070" style="s2">dreaming well you&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.630" end="01:28:03.419" style="s2">you&#39;re not recognizing well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.070" end="01:28:04.949" style="s2">interesting because sometimes I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.419" end="01:28:06.449" style="s2">actually use the information so for</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.949" end="01:28:08.820" style="s2">example when you went into the don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.449" end="01:28:11.189" style="s2">want the best and brightest thing right</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.820" end="01:28:13.380" style="s2">I thought oh my god Sam is gonna drag me</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.189" end="01:28:15.449" style="s2">there and that way he&#39;s a guy who</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.380" end="01:28:17.699" style="s2">believe well no because because there is</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.449" end="01:28:19.260" style="s2">no thing called Xena philic restriction</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.699" end="01:28:22.530" style="s2">ism which is what most of us are</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.260" end="01:28:26.189" style="s2">certainly I am in in my belief structure</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.530" end="01:28:29.369" style="s2">and the idea that every single news</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.189" end="01:28:31.260" style="s2">organ is ready to call any restriction</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.369" end="01:28:32.999" style="s2">as to xenophobe I&#39;m thinking oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.260" end="01:28:34.889" style="s2">Sam is dragging me to this place he</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.999" end="01:28:38.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even know it and I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.889" end="01:28:39.869" style="s2">get angry and agitated and excited and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.369" end="01:28:46.139" style="s2">there was nothing I could do to actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.869" end="01:28:51.829" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t find any control knob but so</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.139" end="01:28:51.829" style="s2">it did come back to - to earth where</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.010" end="01:28:57.960" style="s2">you know because something more concrete</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.810" end="01:29:02.970" style="s2">than pure consciousness the I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.960" end="01:29:05.280" style="s2">the potential hypocrisy in judging</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.970" end="01:29:06.900" style="s2">people I said take you know I just kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.280" end="01:29:07.920" style="s2">of shit all over and now seem to live</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.900" end="01:29:10.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.920" end="01:29:11.400" style="s2">I am total I so I don&#39;t believe in free</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.920" end="01:29:13.050" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.400" end="01:29:14.670" style="s2">yeah I know he didn&#39;t invent himself</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.050" end="01:29:18.720" style="s2">like there&#39;s a place in which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.670" end="01:29:21.120" style="s2">totally non-judgmental of him and these</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.720" end="01:29:22.470" style="s2">you know he can&#39;t do otherwise right</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.120" end="01:29:24.720" style="s2">he&#39;s just he&#39;s just being the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.470" end="01:29:27.180" style="s2">version of nothing to live as his Donald</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.720" end="01:29:29.280" style="s2">Trump right like this just and in</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.180" end="01:29:31.290" style="s2">Trump&#39;s case the thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.280" end="01:29:33.480" style="s2">judgmental I&#39;m not especially judgmental</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.290" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">of him you know I mean he seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.480" end="01:29:39.630" style="s2">malfunctioning robot to me he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:44.280" style="s2">what I&#39;m judgmental of is the larger</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.630" end="01:29:46.440" style="s2">situation of all of this happening and P</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.280" end="01:29:47.760" style="s2">and half the population seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.440" end="01:29:49.740" style="s2">pretending that is something optimal</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.760" end="01:29:52.830" style="s2">about right that&#39;s like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.740" end="01:29:54.840" style="s2">that&#39;s so terrifyingly risky to me that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.830" end="01:29:57.870" style="s2">I think it&#39;s appropriate to be in touch</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.840" end="01:30:00.090" style="s2">with the the outrage module rather than</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.870" end="01:30:01.500" style="s2">the non-judgmental all we&#39;re all in and</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.090" end="01:30:05.670" style="s2">nobody invented nobody created</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.500" end="01:30:10.530" style="s2">themselves module and but I I pick and</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.670" end="01:30:14.130" style="s2">choose my moments of outrage and I get</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.530" end="01:30:16.860" style="s2">off the ride as soon as it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.130" end="01:30:18.420" style="s2">as soon as I noticed there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.860" end="01:30:20.640" style="s2">to be on that&#39;s no longer adapted yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.420" end="01:30:22.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s like how much time am I get so</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.640" end="01:30:24.570" style="s2">now like we in my use of social media</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.680" end="01:30:25.410" style="s2">like I&#39;ll get on Twitter I&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.570" end="01:30:29.310" style="s2">something outrageous</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.410" end="01:30:31.680" style="s2">I&#39;ll get triggered by it but I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.310" end="01:30:34.320" style="s2">get off 30 seconds later and it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.680" end="01:30:37.290" style="s2">right whereas if I if I were to do the</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.320" end="01:30:38.850" style="s2">thing that entangled me you know it</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.290" end="01:30:42.090" style="s2">could you know could take up much more</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.850" end="01:30:45.150" style="s2">of my life and so it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.090" end="01:30:48.120" style="s2">to me that you&#39;ve gotten off Twitter as</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.150" end="01:30:51.770" style="s2">you become more focused on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.120" end="01:30:58.160" style="s2">meditation and mindfulness part of your</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.770" end="01:31:00.300" style="s2">offering right I mean I there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.160" end="01:31:03.120" style="s2">juxtaposition there may be somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.300" end="01:31:04.500" style="s2">accidental but the the the vividness</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.120" end="01:31:08.010" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.500" end="01:31:09.900" style="s2">it there was a spell that&#39;s been broken</p>

<p begin="01:31:15.300" end="01:31:19.680" style="s2">that it was just lip service but I had</p>

<p begin="01:31:47.970" end="01:31:55.380" style="s2">terms but still totally embedded in in</p>

<p begin="01:32:19.260" end="01:32:22.140" style="s2">of people and so you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.820" end="01:32:23.910" style="s2">opportunity for me to tell them to fuck</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.140" end="01:32:27.960" style="s2">off and so I find some way to say that</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.910" end="01:32:29.640" style="s2">and this thing begins playing out and to</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.960" end="01:32:32.970" style="s2">the degree that I&#39;ve stepped away which</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.640" end="01:32:35.760" style="s2">is like 95% now when I come back and I</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.470" end="01:32:48.660" style="s2">do you saw that get diffused yeah I know</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.450" end="01:32:50.940" style="s2">that and I think the skillful diffusal</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.660" end="01:32:52.890" style="s2">of those conflicts is its own public</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.940" end="01:32:54.570" style="s2">good that well Italy is I try to</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.890" end="01:32:57.300" style="s2">maximize yeah there are people that I</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.570" end="01:32:59.250" style="s2">could diffuse because I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.300" end="01:33:02.480" style="s2">want the thing diffuse like you got into</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.250" end="01:33:07.080" style="s2">some you went on this person nice mangos</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.480" end="01:33:09.330" style="s2">podcast that would talk about a no good</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.080" end="01:33:11.010" style="s2">deed going you know there&#39;s just some I</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.330" end="01:33:12.300" style="s2">did my best to launcher podcast there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.010" end="01:33:13.950" style="s2">well if there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.300" end="01:33:15.470" style="s2">that account because there&#39;s many ways</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.950" end="01:33:18.280" style="s2">in which it seems quite reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.470" end="01:33:19.930" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s rated into mental</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.280" end="01:33:22.450" style="s2">well there&#39;s a personal there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.930" end="01:33:25.030" style="s2">personal nastiness about it that just it</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.450" end="01:33:28.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t let up yeah and a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.030" end="01:33:31.260" style="s2">charity and what I find is that there</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.960" end="01:33:34.840" style="s2">are certain things I can do to slow down</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.260" end="01:33:36.610" style="s2">that kind of negative experience and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.840" end="01:33:38.680" style="s2">then there are certain diehard actors</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.610" end="01:33:40.900" style="s2">some of them are quite polite and</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.680" end="01:33:43.150" style="s2">charming and funny who just will not</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.900" end="01:33:45.790" style="s2">like their thing is they will ride this</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.150" end="01:33:50.500" style="s2">to the most negative place if they can</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.790" end="01:33:54.580" style="s2">get there and that sub-community I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.500" end="01:33:56.200" style="s2">been talking about in terms of we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.580" end="01:33:58.060" style="s2">diversity and inclusion which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.200" end="01:34:01.870" style="s2">willing to that say is a good thing and</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.060" end="01:34:03.880" style="s2">then it needs a different function which</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.870" end="01:34:05.470" style="s2">is interoperability and exclusion</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.880" end="01:34:07.120" style="s2">because there are certain people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.470" end="01:34:09.550" style="s2">be at the table for a conversation if</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.120" end="01:34:11.350" style="s2">it&#39;s going to progress and because their</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.550" end="01:34:13.720" style="s2">their interest is in dear alien now I</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.350" end="01:34:17.080" style="s2">got into some weird thing just now do</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.720" end="01:34:19.600" style="s2">you know the singer Billy Bragg I know</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.080" end="01:34:21.430" style="s2">there&#39;s like a progressive you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.600" end="01:34:23.760" style="s2">of like a punk arlo guthrie</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.430" end="01:34:26.200" style="s2">how did Woody Guthrie rather yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.760" end="01:34:28.120" style="s2">like he turns out he wrote a book and</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.200" end="01:34:30.850" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about Eric Weinstein an</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.120" end="01:34:33.640" style="s2">investment banker who is a fiery speech</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.850" end="01:34:35.200" style="s2">you know champion won&#39;t meet with I</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.640" end="01:34:38.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know some hole he&#39;s got a whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.200" end="01:34:40.060" style="s2">story in his mind and only so he took a</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.170" end="01:34:42.970" style="s2">shot at you and in his book he went on</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.060" end="01:34:45.340" style="s2">sam cedars program well there&#39;s a venue</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.970" end="01:34:48.190" style="s2">that is not gonna select for well i just</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.340" end="01:34:50.050" style="s2">opinions I spoke to Sam look there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.190" end="01:34:53.860" style="s2">problem with the Saul Alinsky thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.050" end="01:34:59.020" style="s2">where salt you know so little radical</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.860" end="01:35:01.240" style="s2">the focus on ridicule I think it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.020" end="01:35:05.500" style="s2">to remember like Country Joe and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.240" end="01:35:08.320" style="s2">fish was ridiculing a bad war in terms</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.500" end="01:35:11.290" style="s2">that are ridiculous you&#39;ve now got a</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.320" end="01:35:16.530" style="s2">group of people who if a mathematician</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.290" end="01:35:18.670" style="s2">says you know that in in different</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.530" end="01:35:22.930" style="s2">arithmetics you could have an equation</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.670" end="01:35:25.810" style="s2">like two plus three equals one and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.930" end="01:35:27.250" style="s2">then you get somebody saying I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.810" end="01:35:29.950" style="s2">know what they&#39;re smoking over there at</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.250" end="01:35:31.989" style="s2">Princeton but yeah well that&#39;s ridicule</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.950" end="01:35:33.580" style="s2">but you&#39;re ridiculing something</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.989" end="01:35:35.530" style="s2">you strum and and didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.580" end="01:35:37.150" style="s2">right because the person actually was</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.530" end="01:35:40.000" style="s2">making sense and so what I see is that</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.150" end="01:35:43.660" style="s2">the left and in particular the Sam cedar</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.000" end="01:35:45.190" style="s2">crowd has a doing that with abandon well</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.660" end="01:35:47.140" style="s2">it&#39;s willing to do two separate things</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.190" end="01:35:48.250" style="s2">sama is quite willing like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.140" end="01:35:49.780" style="s2">whole thing but when you talk to Sam</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.250" end="01:35:52.840" style="s2">cedar well you would debate Sam cedar</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.780" end="01:35:55.060" style="s2">and my feeling is I would debate part of</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.840" end="01:35:57.520" style="s2">Sam cedar the part that just is focused</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.060" end="01:36:02.290" style="s2">on the ideas but the part that is kind</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.520" end="01:36:03.910" style="s2">of like nasty and ridic in ridiculing</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.290" end="01:36:05.320" style="s2">and doing the Alinsky thing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.910" end="01:36:06.850" style="s2">what to do with it I&#39;m not interested</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.320" end="01:36:10.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve spoken to Sam cedar and the phone</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.850" end="01:36:13.030" style="s2">is perfectly reasonable made sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.000" end="01:36:14.560" style="s2">we disagreed on on positions but well</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.030" end="01:36:18.239" style="s2">the the line that gets crossed for me</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.560" end="01:36:21.520" style="s2">always with these guys and again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.239" end="01:36:25.480" style="s2">it&#39;s disproportionately on the left is</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.520" end="01:36:27.550" style="s2">the the line of conscious dishonesty</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.480" end="01:36:29.440" style="s2">misses serious your brother&#39;s aphorism</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.550" end="01:36:32.020" style="s2">bad faith changes everything fit changes</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.440" end="01:36:34.060" style="s2">everything and I mean these guys are in</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.020" end="01:36:37.810" style="s2">bad faith they know they&#39;re lying about</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.060" end="01:36:41.320" style="s2">in my case my views my actual beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.810" end="01:36:42.969" style="s2">and not all of them that there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.320" end="01:36:44.830" style="s2">too much information or pachtman</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.969" end="01:36:46.960" style="s2">no David Pakman is fine I just did his</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.830" end="01:36:48.790" style="s2">podcast yeah I know but David Pakman</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.960" end="01:36:50.380" style="s2">said some pretty non charitable things</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.790" end="01:36:53.620" style="s2">in some parts that seem kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.380" end="01:36:55.750" style="s2">ridiculing and amazing I think you me</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.620" end="01:36:59.100" style="s2">other people though I haven&#39;t whatever I</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.750" end="01:37:02.469" style="s2">haven&#39;t I have never seen him</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.100" end="01:37:03.790" style="s2">misrepresent my views and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.469" end="01:37:05.469" style="s2">made again I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I just did</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.790" end="01:37:07.270" style="s2">his podcast once but he seems like the</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.469" end="01:37:09.460" style="s2">he seems like somebody who if I said</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.270" end="01:37:11.170" style="s2">listen you got me wrong here</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.460" end="01:37:12.790" style="s2">that would matter and he would he would</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.170" end="01:37:15.219" style="s2">make an effort to that&#39;s me and that got</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.790" end="01:37:19.870" style="s2">me right which is the problem that we</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.219" end="01:37:21.400" style="s2">have increasingly is that the tactics</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.870" end="01:37:24.580" style="s2">that are being used in what are called</p>

<p begin="01:37:47.919" end="01:37:54.249" style="s2">the means that&#39;s the big problem on the</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.989" end="01:37:56.260" style="s2">left yeah so but that ethic is is flawed</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.249" end="01:37:58.599" style="s2">right so like so for instance it means</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.260" end="01:38:04.030" style="s2">like with me and Trump like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.599" end="01:38:07.389" style="s2">nobody who you don&#39;t denigrate Trump as</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.030" end="01:38:09.880" style="s2">avidly as I do but I am super careful to</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.389" end="01:38:11.169" style="s2">be honest right so like I it&#39;s not that</p>

<p begin="01:38:15.039" end="01:38:18.999" style="s2">Sam cedar can be honest on his show and</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.110" end="01:38:21.280" style="s2">still have a show right nobody&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.999" end="01:38:22.900" style="s2">cancel him because he was too honest no</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.280" end="01:38:24.999" style="s2">I I think that there&#39;s like this very</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.900" end="01:38:26.650" style="s2">weird other I mean I don&#39;t to get into</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.999" end="01:38:28.179" style="s2">the same cedar thing in particular first</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.650" end="01:38:30.519" style="s2">of all because he can do a entire show</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.179" end="01:38:33.209" style="s2">we know you just never have said hey but</p>

<p begin="01:38:37.809" end="01:38:41.679" style="s2">mean I guess there&#39;s a banality of evil</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.030" end="01:38:43.119" style="s2">right like there&#39;s not that many evil</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.679" end="01:38:44.679" style="s2">people right there&#39;s just a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:38:48.699" end="01:38:54.429" style="s2">because they&#39;re not heroes right but so</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.059" end="01:38:56.709" style="s2">it like it takes some work not to be an</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.429" end="01:39:00.159" style="s2">asshole when you are incentivized to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.709" end="01:39:01.269" style="s2">one and and all we&#39;re all vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.159" end="01:39:03.939" style="s2">this but there&#39;s some people who have</p>

<p begin="01:39:03.939" end="01:39:08.559" style="s2">nonsense on the left makes me crazy</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.159" end="01:39:10.539" style="s2">because in part it just feels like all</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.559" end="01:39:13.869" style="s2">of my ideals turned into some pieces</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.539" end="01:39:16.030" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re of the left not only the left</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.869" end="01:39:17.380" style="s2">man I came from a farther left part that</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.030" end="01:39:19.239" style="s2">I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t even know where you</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.380" end="01:39:21.159" style="s2">started but yeah no I meant that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.239" end="01:39:23.229" style="s2">never been tempted to be anything other</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.159" end="01:39:25.479" style="s2">than a Democrat I&#39;ve never even said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.229" end="01:39:27.219" style="s2">gonna be an independent because you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.479" end="01:39:28.539" style="s2">the Democratic Party certainly if I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.219" end="01:39:30.249" style="s2">if I can if I could move to another</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.539" end="01:39:33.550" style="s2">party that made sense I&#39;d do it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.249" end="01:39:34.719" style="s2">yeah anyway I think that what they I</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.550" end="01:39:35.979" style="s2">think that what we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.719" end="01:39:37.749" style="s2">understand is is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.979" end="01:39:39.699" style="s2">homelessness problem that is really</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.749" end="01:39:42.519" style="s2">significant if you are the sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.699" end="01:39:45.309" style="s2">person who needs to attach to some kind</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.519" end="01:39:47.139" style="s2">of institutional structure in a time</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.309" end="01:39:50.829" style="s2">when there is no institution that</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.139" end="01:39:52.749" style="s2">actually holds your perspective you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.829" end="01:39:55.630" style="s2">gonna start to do very bizarre things</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.749" end="01:39:58.119" style="s2">the other thing about you and and and me</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.630" end="01:39:59.860" style="s2">is is the to some extent and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.119" end="01:40:04.070" style="s2">think we can do this long</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.860" end="01:40:05.870" style="s2">we&#39;re okay with being homeless right you</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.070" end="01:40:09.050" style="s2">can remember first principles try to</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.870" end="01:40:11.480" style="s2">think your way out of stuff but it was</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.050" end="01:40:12.950" style="s2">very tough for most people and I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.480" end="01:40:14.690" style="s2">that there is there are these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.950" end="01:40:16.880" style="s2">collection points in the adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.690" end="01:40:19.670" style="s2">landscape of politics would you would</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.880" end="01:40:23.989" style="s2">you would disagree with it yeah well one</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.670" end="01:40:25.580" style="s2">thing that seems important is the</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.989" end="01:40:26.960" style="s2">connection to science I mean we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.580" end="01:40:31.969" style="s2">spending a lot of time talking about</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.960" end="01:40:36.950" style="s2">science in this mode but the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.969" end="01:40:39.440" style="s2">dispassion and self-criticism that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.950" end="01:40:43.250" style="s2">the like is the only rubric under which</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.440" end="01:40:45.140" style="s2">real science can be done bleeds into our</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.250" end="01:40:47.750" style="s2">thinking about all these other issues</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.140" end="01:40:49.250" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s that&#39;s got to be a</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.750" end="01:40:50.900" style="s2">relevant variable this is it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.250" end="01:40:53.300" style="s2">like you either have a scientific cast</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.900" end="01:40:56.270" style="s2">of mind or you don&#39;t and when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.300" end="01:41:02.710" style="s2">I have both right but when you when you</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.270" end="01:41:05.560" style="s2">don&#39;t you&#39;re see you&#39;re not seeing the I</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.710" end="01:41:07.730" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not even you&#39;re not even seen</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.560" end="01:41:09.500" style="s2">intellectual dishonesty for what it is</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.730" end="01:41:11.660" style="s2">right it just it&#39;s just like like</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.500" end="01:41:14.210" style="s2">motivated reasoning it isn&#39;t a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.660" end="01:41:15.500" style="s2">right wishful thinking isn&#39;t a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.210" end="01:41:17.060" style="s2">confirmation bias isn&#39;t a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.500" end="01:41:19.160" style="s2">these are virtues this is in religion</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.060" end="01:41:20.930" style="s2">well faith right this is this is you</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.160" end="01:41:23.780" style="s2">know what is the issue with our friend</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.930" end="01:41:26.750" style="s2">Jordan Peterson which is that when he</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.780" end="01:41:29.000" style="s2">gets really far out there in the I know</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.750" end="01:41:31.520" style="s2">people that called mythopoetic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.000" end="01:41:32.660" style="s2">know the lingo yeah you always wondered</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.520" end="01:41:35.540" style="s2">are you still maintaining a</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.660" end="01:41:37.100" style="s2">fact-checking ability to bring you back</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.540" end="01:41:39.890" style="s2">to earth and so as long as those two</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.100" end="01:41:41.989" style="s2">facilities are present and in dialog and</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.890" end="01:41:43.820" style="s2">as long as the fact-checking</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.989" end="01:41:46.989" style="s2">you know what we what we call the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.820" end="01:41:51.110" style="s2">scientific method is in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.989" end="01:41:53.680" style="s2">inadequate to me to explain how science</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.110" end="01:41:56.300" style="s2">has progressed right all the mad</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.680" end="01:41:58.010" style="s2">thinking and then the spirituality of</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.300" end="01:42:00.170" style="s2">coming up with breaking new ground</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.010" end="01:42:02.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give us ramanuja in about an</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.170" end="01:42:04.520" style="s2">hour ago yeah so he&#39;s having dreams</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.750" end="01:42:06.650" style="s2">about the goddess lakshmi handed him</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.520" end="01:42:08.570" style="s2">theorems well there&#39;s there&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.650" end="01:42:10.280" style="s2">know the careless school of astronomy</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.570" end="01:42:12.020" style="s2">that came up with infinite series before</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.280" end="01:42:14.270" style="s2">newton and leibniz</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.020" end="01:42:16.340" style="s2">was doing it in religious poetry you</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.270" end="01:42:19.390" style="s2">know it Ryan died thinking over there in</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.340" end="01:42:21.920" style="s2">Kerala so there is a there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.390" end="01:42:23.540" style="s2">madness that you have to invite to break</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.920" end="01:42:26.150" style="s2">new ground and there&#39;s a kind of sanity</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.540" end="01:42:30.620" style="s2">that you have to invite to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.150" end="01:42:32.300" style="s2">the madness and our friend Dan barkay</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.620" end="01:42:34.220" style="s2">came up with this idea that science is a</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.300" end="01:42:36.530" style="s2">two-front war but that most people are</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.220" end="01:42:38.390" style="s2">have only been deployed to one front and</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.530" end="01:42:42.080" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s a really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.390" end="01:42:45.080" style="s2">really nice image I do worry that in</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.080" end="01:42:47.030" style="s2">part the activist mindset particularly</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.080" end="01:42:50.360" style="s2">on the left has a very clear idea which</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.030" end="01:42:51.860" style="s2">is that yeah it&#39;s really a shame and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.360" end="01:42:54.920" style="s2">number of people have to get hurt for</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.860" end="01:42:57.140" style="s2">justice to be done and that is a highly</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.920" end="01:43:00.020" style="s2">conserved idea that I had not understood</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.140" end="01:43:03.590" style="s2">was was broadly distributed yeah but I</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.020" end="01:43:08.090" style="s2">mean that that is a an ethic or a pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.590" end="01:43:11.420" style="s2">ethic that we have to just relentlessly</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.090" end="01:43:14.180" style="s2">criticize because it&#39;s so much harm it</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.420" end="01:43:16.730" style="s2">gets done I mean that that is the the</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.180" end="01:43:18.770" style="s2">thinking that allows good people or</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.730" end="01:43:20.870" style="s2">otherwise good people to create immense</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.770" end="01:43:23.330" style="s2">harm just like let&#39;s yeah throw throw</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.870" end="01:43:25.400" style="s2">them off the rooftops because they you</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.330" end="01:43:26.840" style="s2">know the purge is on and it&#39;s sorry we</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.400" end="01:43:29.180" style="s2">have to break these many eggs like this</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.840" end="01:43:31.070" style="s2">omelette but partially the question is</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.180" end="01:43:34.520" style="s2">how do we spend enough time together to</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.070" end="01:43:36.800" style="s2">get past this problem like I really</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.520" end="01:43:39.020" style="s2">think it&#39;s quite serious that well part</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.800" end="01:43:40.790" style="s2">of it is is that we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.020" end="01:43:42.920" style="s2">doing much of this face-to-face</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.790" end="01:43:46.190" style="s2">like I&#39;ve never met nassim I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.920" end="01:43:47.210" style="s2">met Sam seed or I&#39;ve never met it they</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.190" end="01:43:50.480" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have been in the same sentence</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.210" end="01:43:53.300" style="s2">a very different problems but if if I</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.480" end="01:43:55.040" style="s2">had if before any of this had happened</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.300" end="01:43:57.170" style="s2">says Sam cedar I think has done probably</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.040" end="01:43:58.460" style="s2">a dozen shows or I mean I&#39;m always</p>

<p begin="01:44:47.869" end="01:44:53.719" style="s2">issue and it just didn&#39;t do the flip it</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.900" end="01:44:55.849" style="s2">around it was more of a betrayal you</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.719" end="01:44:59.090" style="s2">know or seeming betrayal given the fact</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.849" end="01:45:01.190" style="s2">that you had hung out together it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.090" end="01:45:04.040" style="s2">just coming over the transit rail in</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.190" end="01:45:07.250" style="s2">part was was my betrayal of Claire I</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.040" end="01:45:09.110" style="s2">just didn&#39;t know it well whatever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.250" end="01:45:11.329" style="s2">just saying no change if you know each</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.110" end="01:45:14.090" style="s2">other right and make a different point</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.329" end="01:45:17.780" style="s2">right when somebody you know behaves in</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.090" end="01:45:19.309" style="s2">a way that is very most unexpected right</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.780" end="01:45:21.380" style="s2">what I try to do is I try to slow it</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.309" end="01:45:23.750" style="s2">down I say I bet we&#39;re watching two</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.380" end="01:45:26.540" style="s2">different movies yeah and your story in</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.750" end="01:45:28.280" style="s2">my story or not the gears are not lining</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.540" end="01:45:30.349" style="s2">up and so if we just push on the gears</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.280" end="01:45:31.960" style="s2">the teeth are gonna pop off and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.349" end="01:45:35.659" style="s2">the end of everything and so with Claire</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.960" end="01:45:38.090" style="s2">what I tried to figure out is why are</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.659" end="01:45:39.110" style="s2">you repeatedly sort of coming at you</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.090" end="01:45:40.670" style="s2">know do you need to burnish your</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.110" end="01:45:42.889" style="s2">credentials that your objective that you</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.670" end="01:45:44.719" style="s2">don&#39;t have tribalist loyalty that was</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.889" end="01:45:46.670" style="s2">one set of issues there was another</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.719" end="01:45:49.520" style="s2">issue which is that Nasim had gone after</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.670" end="01:45:53.059" style="s2">Claire and I was silent I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.520" end="01:45:54.260" style="s2">get involved I didn&#39;t like the way Nasim</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.059" end="01:45:56.090" style="s2">was going about doing what he was doing</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.260" end="01:45:59.900" style="s2">absolutely couldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.090" end="01:46:02.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t like it detested it on the other</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.900" end="01:46:05.540" style="s2">hand I have a particular bug in my</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.630" end="01:46:07.730" style="s2">bonnet about IQ and race which is that I</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.540" end="01:46:10.489" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an absolutely dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.730" end="01:46:13.579" style="s2">topic that&#39;s being explored in a really</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.489" end="01:46:18.320" style="s2">bad way even by good people right and</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.579" end="01:46:20.030" style="s2">that in part I IQ has this curse that</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.320" end="01:46:22.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve said it&#39;s a pretty good measure of</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.030" end="01:46:24.260" style="s2">intelligence it would be much better if</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.190" end="01:46:27.260" style="s2">it was obviously terrible or really</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.260" end="01:46:28.849" style="s2">terrific but it&#39;s in exactly the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.260" end="01:46:30.530" style="s2">place that it does tell us something</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.849" end="01:46:34.040" style="s2">about intelligence and not nearly enough</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.530" end="01:46:38.030" style="s2">so you can be a genius with low IQ right</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.040" end="01:46:39.020" style="s2">that problem you know was being teased</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.030" end="01:46:40.730" style="s2">out and</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.020" end="01:46:42.200" style="s2">neither of them the reason I stayed out</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.730" end="01:46:43.730" style="s2">of is just like I didn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.200" end="01:46:45.800" style="s2">Claire&#39;s position as I understood it and</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.730" end="01:46:48.080" style="s2">I didn&#39;t believe in the seems tactics as</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.800" end="01:46:49.940" style="s2">I understood them and Claire interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.080" end="01:46:52.280" style="s2">that I think and I don&#39;t know this to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.940" end="01:46:55.850" style="s2">true as well you know you&#39;re seeing me</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.280" end="01:46:57.380" style="s2">getting mauled right and I thought you</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.850" end="01:47:00.500" style="s2">would be there you know or something</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.380" end="01:47:02.750" style="s2">like that and so in part just backing up</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.500" end="01:47:05.000" style="s2">everything slowing it down trying to</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.750" end="01:47:08.390" style="s2">listen you know Ben and I have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.000" end="01:47:09.980" style="s2">sideways a few few times to his credit</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.390" end="01:47:12.920" style="s2">every time I take something to Ben</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.980" end="01:47:15.890" style="s2">Shapiro he&#39;ll think better of himself</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.920" end="01:47:18.860" style="s2">and he&#39;ll yeah yeah no I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.890" end="01:47:20.270" style="s2">that&#39;s my experience as well even though</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.860" end="01:47:22.220" style="s2">he and the accounting part of his</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.270" end="01:47:25.850" style="s2">business yeah ya know that counts for a</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.220" end="01:47:27.640" style="s2">lot so so the the place where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.850" end="01:47:30.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached some kind of bad faith</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.640" end="01:47:31.910" style="s2">singularity right is where I think okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.290" end="01:47:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s like we just have to cut our</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.910" end="01:47:36.380" style="s2">losses there&#39;s no conversation like</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.920" end="01:47:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why I would never talk to Sam</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.380" end="01:47:41.870" style="s2">cedar in a public forum he&#39;s he&#39;s proven</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.840" end="01:47:44.000" style="s2">himself so committed to the singularity</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.870" end="01:47:46.580" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s like there&#39;s a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.000" end="01:47:49.880" style="s2">I can there&#39;s maybe 20 people who are</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.580" end="01:47:52.700" style="s2">just on this part of the landscape where</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.880" end="01:47:54.670" style="s2">there&#39;s no coming back from it I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.700" end="01:47:57.890" style="s2">made it that&#39;s coming obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.670" end="01:47:59.720" style="s2">an appropriate any conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.890" end="01:48:02.360" style="s2">would have to happen would have to begin</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.720" end="01:48:05.480" style="s2">with an actual apology like it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.360" end="01:48:08.210" style="s2">bad there&#39;s no alternate movie version</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.480" end="01:48:10.460" style="s2">that&#39;s exculpatory but right these</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.210" end="01:48:13.880" style="s2">people know their line they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.460" end="01:48:15.530" style="s2">avidly lying it&#39;s all malicious it&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="01:48:18.650" end="01:48:22.940" style="s2">but the look the best that can be said</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.020" end="01:48:25.580" style="s2">for it again I don&#39;t get along with it</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.940" end="01:48:26.990" style="s2">right is I believe that they think that</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.580" end="01:48:28.280" style="s2">they&#39;re in desperate times and they</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.990" end="01:48:29.900" style="s2">believe that desperate times call for</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.280" end="01:48:31.730" style="s2">desperate measures and that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.900" end="01:48:34.150" style="s2">the mindset which is the ridicule is</p>

<p begin="01:50:01.420" end="01:50:05.710" style="s2">what really in part what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.190" end="01:50:08.710" style="s2">get at which is is that when I went to</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.710" end="01:50:11.500" style="s2">Washington in like 1996 on the</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.710" end="01:50:14.380" style="s2">immigration issues I went into some</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.500" end="01:50:16.390" style="s2">staffers like um warren of cubicles and</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.380" end="01:50:18.370" style="s2">i saw the sign on one of the cubicles</p>

<p begin="01:50:18.370" end="01:50:25.060" style="s2">it&#39;s worth fighting dirty for and i came</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.870" end="01:50:27.310" style="s2">to understand that if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.060" end="01:50:29.200" style="s2">survive and thrive and get stuff done in</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.310" end="01:50:32.440" style="s2">washington that that had been absorbed</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.200" end="01:50:33.850" style="s2">almost universally right and then once i</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.440" end="01:50:35.230" style="s2">realized that i had to make a decision</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.850" end="01:50:37.300" style="s2">did i really want to get good things</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.230" end="01:50:39.670" style="s2">done or did i want to stay a person i</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.300" end="01:50:42.640" style="s2">could live with and that&#39;s very painful</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.670" end="01:50:45.910" style="s2">to actually have to think about yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.640" end="01:50:47.590" style="s2">i think that is an easy choice or should</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.910" end="01:50:48.670" style="s2">should be we want to make a we want to</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.590" end="01:50:50.590" style="s2">create a world where that&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.670" end="01:50:52.150" style="s2">choice we want to create a world in</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.590" end="01:50:54.130" style="s2">which that&#39;s an easy choice what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.150" end="01:50:55.660" style="s2">created is a system of selective</p>

<p begin="01:50:55.660" end="01:50:59.650" style="s2">selecting for that over and over again</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.370" end="01:51:01.750" style="s2">and you don&#39;t realize and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.650" end="01:51:03.550" style="s2">this is the issue the reason that so</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.750" end="01:51:05.800" style="s2">many of these things make me angry like</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.550" end="01:51:08.410" style="s2">the the Great Moderation</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.800" end="01:51:10.600" style="s2">or the abuse of the immigration system</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.410" end="01:51:12.450" style="s2">to decrease wages and then you clerk cry</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.600" end="01:51:16.420" style="s2">xenophobia when somebody points it out</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.450" end="01:51:18.010" style="s2">or NAFTA and a lot large areas of the</p>

<p begin="01:51:19.300" end="01:51:24.130" style="s2">off is is that all of these things I can</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.000" end="01:51:27.040" style="s2">see in real time like right now what I</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.130" end="01:51:29.560" style="s2">can see like those things of the past is</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.040" end="01:51:31.900" style="s2">I can see this weird and this is getting</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.560" end="01:51:34.480" style="s2">back to the Jeff Epstein thing there is</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.900" end="01:51:36.190" style="s2">a deliberate attempt not to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.480" end="01:51:38.500" style="s2">the intelligence community and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.190" end="01:51:41.740" style="s2">links to Jeffrey Epstein and it is clear</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.500" end="01:51:43.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very short proof because</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.740" end="01:51:44.680" style="s2">assume that he had no links to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.330" end="01:51:46.720" style="s2">Intelligence Committee but none</p>

<p begin="01:51:59.110" end="01:52:04.060" style="s2">know which is how is this guy tied in</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.610" end="01:52:05.470" style="s2">with the intelligence community right so</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.060" end="01:52:08.590" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s fishy that no one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:52:15.730" end="01:52:20.860" style="s2">you could get paid by showing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.120" end="01:52:23.110" style="s2">not true or making the best argument</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.860" end="01:52:25.150" style="s2">possible or making fun of how thin the</p>

<p begin="01:54:04.030" end="01:54:07.330" style="s2">it vanished apart from the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.830" end="01:54:09.430" style="s2">just don&#39;t have the bandwidth for it</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.330" end="01:54:12.850" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s like there was no there was</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.430" end="01:54:14.440" style="s2">no link that made it clearly ideological</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.850" end="01:54:15.970" style="s2">I mean that nothing surfaced he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.440" end="01:54:17.440" style="s2">that clear white supremacist or he</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.970" end="01:54:19.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a jihadist I mean it was November</p>

<p begin="01:54:24.310" end="01:54:29.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the legacy of that</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.010" end="01:54:33.490" style="s2">that atrocity but the if you had told me</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.680" end="01:54:34.930" style="s2">at any point beforehand that you know on</p>

<p begin="01:54:52.150" end="01:54:57.250" style="s2">thing oh no no I think I dan Bilzerian</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.300" end="01:54:59.140" style="s2">is that running out of the right thing</p>

<p begin="01:55:07.900" end="01:55:12.100" style="s2">compute but that&#39;s that is that the</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.540" end="01:55:15.130" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in I mean somehow it</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.100" end="01:55:17.440" style="s2">just didn&#39;t survive the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.130" end="01:55:18.880" style="s2">contest with whatever else was on social</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.440" end="01:55:20.620" style="s2">media I really think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.880" end="01:55:22.960" style="s2">happens well so listen why aren&#39;t we</p>

<p begin="01:55:35.620" end="01:55:43.750" style="s2">noticing right right so my claim like</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.290" end="01:55:46.210" style="s2">wait but you don&#39;t buy my explanation</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.750" end="01:55:49.030" style="s2">which is because there was not an</p>

<p begin="01:56:10.660" end="01:56:15.219" style="s2">a different relationship to information</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.400" end="01:56:16.480" style="s2">now in really agree that we&#39;re cycling</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.219" end="01:56:19.030" style="s2">through the ends very quickly but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.480" end="01:56:20.560" style="s2">that was a spectacular there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.030" end="01:56:23.860" style="s2">we&#39;re talking it was amazing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.560" end="01:56:25.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s anomalously weird how fast</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.860" end="01:56:28.120" style="s2">that story disappeared oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.719" end="01:56:29.560" style="s2">now one of the things that you we have</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.120" end="01:56:33.250" style="s2">to we have to talk about in that in that</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.560" end="01:56:35.170" style="s2">realm is Dana Boyd and her discussion of</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.250" end="01:56:37.890" style="s2">strategic silence so that&#39;s your search</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.170" end="01:56:41.380" style="s2">string people playing along at home</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.890" end="01:56:43.420" style="s2">strategic silence is a doctrine of some</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.380" end="01:56:45.520" style="s2">kind that says that news media should</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.420" end="01:56:48.430" style="s2">not report the news because of its</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.520" end="01:56:51.160" style="s2">potential impact and where was this</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.430" end="01:56:53.770" style="s2">articulated you should check out data</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.160" end="01:56:57.489" style="s2">and society which is a particularly</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.770" end="01:56:59.950" style="s2">interesting organization which fingered</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.489" end="01:57:02.020" style="s2">our friends as the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.950" end="01:57:06.219" style="s2">influencer network all right right and</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.020" end="01:57:09.660" style="s2">we have Dana Boyd who I believe is sort</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.219" end="01:57:12.340" style="s2">of in our circles in the tech circles</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.660" end="01:57:15.580" style="s2">starts talking about the need for</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.340" end="01:57:18.190" style="s2">strategic society girl Dana or a boy</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.580" end="01:57:20.950" style="s2">Dana a female okay somebody I perceive</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.190" end="01:57:27.180" style="s2">to be female yeah I don&#39;t want to touch</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.950" end="01:57:29.170" style="s2">okay a human named Dana Boyd right and</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.180" end="01:57:31.270" style="s2">strategic silence she also talks about</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.170" end="01:57:33.520" style="s2">data gaps if I&#39;m not mistaken I have my</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.270" end="01:57:35.410" style="s2">terminology right and so then you have</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.520" end="01:57:37.180" style="s2">to look at things like style guides like</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.410" end="01:57:38.739" style="s2">the AP style guide or the New York Times</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.180" end="01:57:42.040" style="s2">style guide which is the DES way in</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.739" end="01:57:44.410" style="s2">which people are directed to report news</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.040" end="01:57:47.320" style="s2">stories is there a danger of copycat</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.410" end="01:57:48.000" style="s2">killings so there may be a body of</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.320" end="01:57:50.700" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.000" end="01:57:52.590" style="s2">what does one do around mass shootings</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.700" end="01:57:54.720" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t have future mass</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.590" end="01:57:58.050" style="s2">shootings or if this is particularly</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.720" end="01:57:59.550" style="s2">exciting to certain people should we</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.050" end="01:58:02.280" style="s2">publish the manifesto</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.550" end="01:58:04.980" style="s2">so as you start to understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.280" end="01:58:06.870" style="s2">meta rules around these things are some</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.980" end="01:58:08.130" style="s2">of those could be innocent well I think</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.870" end="01:58:09.270" style="s2">I think that some are better than</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.130" end="01:58:11.520" style="s2">innocent I think some are benign and</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.270" end="01:58:13.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve been slow to adopt them I think I</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.520" end="01:58:15.270" style="s2">think I think the fact that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.170" end="01:58:17.640" style="s2">this guy&#39;s name is probably a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.270" end="01:58:19.140" style="s2">for the world and that was that was part</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.640" end="01:58:22.260" style="s2">of the style new style guide you just</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.140" end="01:58:27.240" style="s2">don&#39;t you read the New Zealand shooters</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.260" end="01:58:29.250" style="s2">manifesto no but I a part of it but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.240" end="01:58:33.030" style="s2">I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t read the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.250" end="01:58:36.780" style="s2">no so but like what I don&#39;t want is I</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.030" end="01:58:39.390" style="s2">don&#39;t want somebody saying we should not</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.780" end="01:58:41.310" style="s2">read this we should criminalize reading</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.390" end="01:58:43.350" style="s2">the New Zealand shooters manifesto but</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.310" end="01:58:45.150" style="s2">by the way let me tell you he told he</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.350" end="01:58:47.610" style="s2">told us all that Candice Owens was his</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.150" end="01:58:50.010" style="s2">inspiration right because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.610" end="01:58:51.630" style="s2">what the shooter did so now we well no</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.010" end="01:58:54.000" style="s2">one wants to criminalize I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.630" end="01:58:56.040" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s a simple or disturb</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.000" end="01:58:59.480" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate for the for journalists</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.040" end="01:59:03.300" style="s2">to worry that merely shining a light</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.480" end="01:59:08.400" style="s2">push up pointing a camera at this new</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.300" end="01:59:10.590" style="s2">atrocity is the the should be that the</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.400" end="01:59:13.410" style="s2">default setting right like name the guy</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.590" end="01:59:15.720" style="s2">let&#39;s get into his story let&#39;s find out</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.410" end="01:59:17.640" style="s2">why he did it and do all this we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.720" end="01:59:20.730" style="s2">such a much more dangerous place in my</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.640" end="01:59:22.080" style="s2">opinion and I but know about maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.730" end="01:59:23.550" style="s2">talking past each other here it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.080" end="01:59:28.200" style="s2">that it is we&#39;ve been very slow to</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.550" end="01:59:31.830" style="s2">realize that the part of the the mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.200" end="01:59:33.630" style="s2">contagion here is the copycat effect the</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.830" end="01:59:36.240" style="s2">fact that people in in their own</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.630" end="01:59:39.480" style="s2">perverse way these people are being</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.240" end="01:59:41.130" style="s2">martyred and lionized just by the just</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.480" end="01:59:44.640" style="s2">the mere sharing of this in place in</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.130" end="01:59:47.460" style="s2">memory that in a better world we would</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.640" end="01:59:51.390" style="s2">have a situation by which we would not</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.460" end="01:59:55.110" style="s2">want to communicate these people famous</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.390" end="01:59:57.630" style="s2">we don&#39;t there&#39;s the famous part of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.110" end="02:00:00.780" style="s2">motive right posthumous fame even is</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.630" end="02:00:01.469" style="s2">part of the motive so as part if it even</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.780" end="02:00:03.030" style="s2">if it&#39;s not part</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.469" end="02:00:08.249" style="s2">the motive it&#39;s part of what is</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.030" end="02:00:09.929" style="s2">attractive to the living aspiring gunmen</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.249" end="02:00:11.400" style="s2">first of all let me steal me in your</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.929" end="02:00:12.989" style="s2">position to make sure I&#39;m getting it and</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.400" end="02:00:14.699" style="s2">then I can take issue with you and</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.989" end="02:00:17.820" style="s2">you&#39;ll see whether I&#39;m smoking adding or</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.699" end="02:00:19.559" style="s2">subtracting right I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.820" end="02:00:22.289" style="s2">saying is is that because of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.559" end="02:00:26.579" style="s2">information quality and the fame quality</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.289" end="02:00:29.219" style="s2">and the inspirational quality to copycat</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.579" end="02:00:31.139" style="s2">killers that communicating the</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.219" end="02:00:33.869" style="s2">information that somebody wish to</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.139" end="02:00:36.690" style="s2">communicate provided they&#39;re willing to</p>

<p begin="02:00:40.190" end="02:00:44.760" style="s2">I&#39;m not even focused on the manifesto</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.809" end="02:00:46.829" style="s2">I&#39;m focused on just just naming the</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.760" end="02:00:48.749" style="s2">person okay you know you&#39;re sympathetic</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.829" end="02:00:51.929" style="s2">at some level with the concept of</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.749" end="02:00:54.420" style="s2">strategic silence yeah I would be</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.929" end="02:00:57.119" style="s2">sympathetic with the concept of</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.420" end="02:00:59.010" style="s2">strategic silence if I trusted the</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.119" end="02:01:00.269" style="s2">people who are supposed to manage it but</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.010" end="02:01:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m trying to get to the next</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.269" end="02:01:05.159" style="s2">layer I understand that concern I am</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.030" end="02:01:08.309" style="s2">very concerned that the people who are</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.159" end="02:01:10.349" style="s2">enthusiastic about strategic silence are</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.309" end="02:01:12.570" style="s2">interested in telling us partial</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.349" end="02:01:14.489" style="s2">information about all of these things so</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.570" end="02:01:16.199" style="s2">that we cannot actually tell what the</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.489" end="02:01:19.170" style="s2">hell just happened well yet so you just</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.199" end="02:01:21.659" style="s2">change the topic to jihadism and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.170" end="02:01:25.309" style="s2">perfectly in agreement because yes they</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.659" end="02:01:28.409" style="s2">will allied the religious identity of</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.309" end="02:01:31.769" style="s2">perpetrators in various contexts and</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.409" end="02:01:33.659" style="s2">actually hide information from us right</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.769" end="02:01:35.999" style="s2">so those are you&#39;ll see so you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.659" end="02:01:38.280" style="s2">something happen it&#39;ll that the media</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.999" end="02:01:39.599" style="s2">will pretend is inexplicable right like</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.280" end="02:01:42.119" style="s2">the end of the Orlando shooting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.599" end="02:01:44.190" style="s2">like maybe this guy was just it was his</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.119" end="02:01:47.579" style="s2">repressed homosexuality that was that</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.190" end="02:01:48.599" style="s2">was the problem right and yet those who</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.579" end="02:01:50.460" style="s2">have a little bit of information</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.599" end="02:01:52.739" style="s2">recognize that this is a clear-cut case</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.460" end="02:01:54.300" style="s2">of jihadism and indoctrination and a</p>

<p begin="02:02:07.019" end="02:02:09.869" style="s2">going to say is that in all of these</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.249" end="02:02:12.420" style="s2">killings like you just pointed out that</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.869" end="02:02:14.760" style="s2">the Unabomber you read reread the</p>

<p begin="02:02:33.869" end="02:02:39.010" style="s2">however the point was is that you were</p>

<p begin="02:02:39.010" end="02:02:42.190" style="s2">then you were able to reach some pretty</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.600" end="02:02:44.380" style="s2">interesting conclusions about where</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.190" end="02:02:48.239" style="s2">Kaczynski was relative to society in</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.380" end="02:02:51.520" style="s2">general you trusted yourself right okay</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.239" end="02:02:55.840" style="s2">my guess is that when it comes to</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.520" end="02:02:57.400" style="s2">jihadis you are more interested in</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.840" end="02:02:59.350" style="s2">communicating the information about what</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.400" end="02:03:01.480" style="s2">the motivational structure is because it</p>

<p begin="02:03:01.480" end="02:03:06.580" style="s2">done however well so actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.960" end="02:03:08.590" style="s2">another reason is it&#39;s it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.580" end="02:03:14.830" style="s2">that it&#39;s prescriptive it may not be</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.590" end="02:03:17.650" style="s2">it&#39;s just that is it they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.830" end="02:03:19.360" style="s2">there&#39;s more contact between there more</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.650" end="02:03:21.250" style="s2">levers to play with you try to control</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.360" end="02:03:25.239" style="s2">it and it&#39;s a much larger problem no</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.250" end="02:03:27.040" style="s2">kidding right but on the other hand if I</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.239" end="02:03:30.070" style="s2">look at the New Zealand shooters and the</p>

<p begin="02:04:24.969" end="02:04:28.449" style="s2">and some of those people are gonna go</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.070" end="02:04:29.440" style="s2">crazy and they&#39;re going to kill people</p>

<p begin="02:04:54.850" end="02:04:58.870" style="s2">society is is that I understand all</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.489" end="02:05:01.900" style="s2">sorts of things that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.870" end="02:05:03.820" style="s2">do but they&#39;re super dangerous they are</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.900" end="02:05:05.830" style="s2">incredibly dangerous in part because</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.820" end="02:05:08.050" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be backed by people like</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.830" end="02:05:09.580" style="s2">Bill and Melinda Gates yeah or the</p>

<p begin="02:05:16.390" end="02:05:22.090" style="s2">here all right I I totally agree that in</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.020" end="02:05:24.190" style="s2">this case we can&#39;t really trust the</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.090" end="02:05:28.540" style="s2">gatekeepers what the only thing that I</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.190" end="02:05:31.060" style="s2">was expressing open open mindedness</p>

<p begin="02:08:57.190" end="02:09:02.320" style="s2">rose ceremony ever we&#39;ve got to realize</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.090" end="02:09:04.840" style="s2">that what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.320" end="02:09:07.449" style="s2">people crazy because they can see that</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.840" end="02:09:09.340" style="s2">it&#39;s the Truman Show yeah so if we had a</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.449" end="02:09:11.949" style="s2">discussion where we like have you heard</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.340" end="02:09:14.050" style="s2">strategic silence before I think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.949" end="02:09:17.530" style="s2">vote for me I know yeah I think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.050" end="02:09:19.390" style="s2">heard the phrase but but the national</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.530" end="02:09:21.820" style="s2">discussion and coming to a national</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.390" end="02:09:24.000" style="s2">consensus about this or we&#39;re gonna use</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.820" end="02:09:26.080" style="s2">strategic silence when it&#39;s jihadi</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.000" end="02:09:28.659" style="s2">violence right and we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.080" end="02:09:31.210" style="s2">use it when it&#39;s white supremacist</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.659" end="02:09:32.460" style="s2">violence yeah in a different way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.210" end="02:09:34.929" style="s2">gonna leak particular information</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.460" end="02:09:37.330" style="s2">provided it goes this way not that way</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.929" end="02:09:40.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going to cause an infinite</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.330" end="02:09:41.620" style="s2">series Trump yeah well yeah and more</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.120" end="02:09:43.449" style="s2">importantly for this topic I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.620" end="02:09:45.820" style="s2">it&#39;s imperative that we understand what</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.449" end="02:09:47.409" style="s2">what is actually going on and what why</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.820" end="02:09:51.340" style="s2">people are doing what they&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.409" end="02:09:54.640" style="s2">what the what the the the scale of the</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.340" end="02:09:57.159" style="s2">the relative risks are and just how big</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.640" end="02:09:59.320" style="s2">a problem is I mean my last podcast</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.159" end="02:10:00.670" style="s2">which I haven&#39;t released yet is on this</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.320" end="02:10:02.590" style="s2">topic just talking to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.670" end="02:10:04.900" style="s2">written a history of white supremacy and</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.590" end="02:10:06.489" style="s2">white power in the US and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.900" end="02:10:08.949" style="s2">trying to get a handle on how big a</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.489" end="02:10:11.199" style="s2">problem it is and I and I came away from</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.949" end="02:10:13.330" style="s2">that podcast convinced more or less that</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.199" end="02:10:16.590" style="s2">nobody knows how big a problem it is</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.330" end="02:10:19.300" style="s2">right so but there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.590" end="02:10:22.719" style="s2">in this particular space there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.300" end="02:10:23.530" style="s2">possibility of conflating the the new</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.719" end="02:10:27.370" style="s2">mimetics</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.530" end="02:10:30.130" style="s2">of 4chan and hn where you have insell</p>

<p begin="02:10:30.130" end="02:10:34.960" style="s2">imagery and you know and lynching photos</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.770" end="02:10:37.320" style="s2">exactly right just to get a rise out of</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.960" end="02:10:42.489" style="s2">the normies right where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.320" end="02:10:44.620" style="s2">actually the the ideological software</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.489" end="02:10:45.969" style="s2">program that we&#39;re worried about when</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.620" end="02:10:48.370" style="s2">we&#39;re worried about the KKK and</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.969" end="02:10:50.199" style="s2">neo-nazis and their sincere attempt to</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.370" end="02:10:52.120" style="s2">well there&#39;s that and there&#39;s also kula</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.199" end="02:10:53.290" style="s2">in the u.s. right I agree with that then</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.120" end="02:10:56.679" style="s2">we also have this very different</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.290" end="02:10:58.840" style="s2">situation in which we have a problem on</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.679" end="02:11:02.770" style="s2">the Left where I don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.840" end="02:11:05.920" style="s2">left is as yet it has the same</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.770" end="02:11:09.239" style="s2">propensity for violence that the KKK</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.920" end="02:11:11.190" style="s2">style white supremacist had right</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.239" end="02:11:14.250" style="s2">it&#39;s been totally normalized this</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.190" end="02:11:16.410" style="s2">far-left woke destruction of the basic</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.250" end="02:11:19.280" style="s2">ability to think inside of the sense</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.410" end="02:11:23.040" style="s2">making organs whereas there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.280" end="02:11:24.810" style="s2">normalization of Stormfront right and</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.040" end="02:11:26.910" style="s2">people are gonna try to say that the</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.810" end="02:11:28.620" style="s2">president you know is the normalization</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.910" end="02:11:30.510" style="s2">of that and I created a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.620" end="02:11:34.020" style="s2">with the presidency but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.510" end="02:11:36.450" style="s2">that that storm front you know and so in</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.020" end="02:11:38.960" style="s2">that picture I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.450" end="02:11:41.070" style="s2">increasingly coming to the conclusion of</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.960" end="02:11:43.710" style="s2">surrounds the idea that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.070" end="02:11:45.180" style="s2">have very low resolution conversations</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.710" end="02:11:47.340" style="s2">which is what the baby boomers and the</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.180" end="02:11:49.050" style="s2">traditional media taught us to do we</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.340" end="02:11:51.180" style="s2">have these very small sound bites and</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.050" end="02:11:52.680" style="s2">they do you think the left is worse than</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.180" end="02:11:54.690" style="s2">the right are you kidding me</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.680" end="02:11:58.170" style="s2">well there&#39;s no way to square that</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.690" end="02:12:00.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s multivariate and it depends</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.170" end="02:12:02.489" style="s2">which way you compressed worse or better</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.120" end="02:12:04.080" style="s2">to say which thing actually you know</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.489" end="02:12:05.489" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about potential energy or</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.080" end="02:12:08.940" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about realized energy</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.489" end="02:12:13.520" style="s2">yeah yeah and also there&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.940" end="02:12:16.980" style="s2">fringe is not the same it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.520" end="02:12:18.930" style="s2">thickness on the far left and the far</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.980" end="02:12:23.489" style="s2">right like that the far the far left</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.930" end="02:12:25.290" style="s2">fringe has much more of effect much more</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.489" end="02:12:26.880" style="s2">than effect on the mainstream then the</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.290" end="02:12:29.460" style="s2">far-right fringe does I mean the far</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.880" end="02:12:31.739" style="s2">left fringe has affected how the New</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.460" end="02:12:34.500" style="s2">York Times does its thing and how Texas</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.739" end="02:12:37.820" style="s2">looking how it and you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.500" end="02:12:41.010" style="s2">have if we had members of the KKK</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.820" end="02:12:43.050" style="s2">determining what gets published on the</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.010" end="02:12:44.940" style="s2">opinion page of the New York Times right</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.050" end="02:12:47.580" style="s2">that would be the analogous problem</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.940" end="02:12:49.290" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s we don&#39;t see it we</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.580" end="02:12:52.170" style="s2">don&#39;t see it no and we can&#39;t discuss it</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.290" end="02:12:53.250" style="s2">in my opinion because of the key thing</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.170" end="02:12:57.600" style="s2">that we were supposed to do with</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.250" end="02:12:59.730" style="s2">long-form stuff is to raise the level of</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.600" end="02:13:01.200" style="s2">resolution possible in the discussion we</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.730" end="02:13:03.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t push out enough terminology</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.200" end="02:13:05.160" style="s2">enough sort of new patterns of thinking</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.450" end="02:13:07.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s the work left to be done so</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.160" end="02:13:09.930" style="s2">this is like sort of a personal question</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.170" end="02:13:11.100" style="s2">and it has to do with the fact that I</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.930" end="02:13:12.510" style="s2">know you&#39;ve reviewed some of the</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.100" end="02:13:15.860" style="s2">episodes of this show that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.510" end="02:13:19.100" style="s2">partially responsible for helping birth</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.860" end="02:13:22.280" style="s2">you have any feedback for me as to</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.100" end="02:13:23.480" style="s2">what&#39;s worked what hasn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.280" end="02:13:24.739" style="s2">can sort of talk to you a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.480" end="02:13:29.239" style="s2">about where I&#39;m thinking about taking</p>
<p begin="02:13:24.739" end="02:13:30.770" style="s2">the show and are you happy with it or</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.239" end="02:13:34.130" style="s2">what would you like to see from the</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.770" end="02:13:36.020" style="s2">portal I&#39;ve not know this from anybody</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.130" end="02:13:37.219" style="s2">else yeah no I&#39;m just I&#39;m incredibly</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.020" end="02:13:39.349" style="s2">happy you&#39;re doing it I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.219" end="02:13:42.349" style="s2">you&#39;re the right man for the job so you</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.349" end="02:13:46.219" style="s2">should be on to the it said you should</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.349" end="02:13:48.860" style="s2">be I&#39;m just you know it&#39;s about time</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.219" end="02:13:50.599" style="s2">right like I&#39;ve been waiting you you</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.860" end="02:13:52.489" style="s2">have been nudging but like it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.599" end="02:13:55.039" style="s2">bit intimidating to you know for some</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.489" end="02:13:56.690" style="s2">reason I broke into this sort of top</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.039" end="02:13:59.000" style="s2">echelon of people with enormous</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.690" end="02:14:02.690" style="s2">audiences and really professional</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.000" end="02:14:10.510" style="s2">content so it&#39;s you know but what I what</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.690" end="02:14:10.510" style="s2">I think you&#39;re doing is novel in that</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.929" end="02:14:18.110" style="s2">why so you know you only have so much</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.369" end="02:14:20.059" style="s2">control over what you get because you</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.110" end="02:14:22.849" style="s2">know the other person has to show up and</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.059" end="02:14:24.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not quite sure in many cases what</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.849" end="02:14:26.449" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna bring but like in your</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.500" end="02:14:29.059" style="s2">case you had a conversation with David</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.449" end="02:14:31.460" style="s2">Wolpe right who I&#39;ve debated several</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.059" end="02:14:33.710" style="s2">times both in public and in private and</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.460" end="02:14:36.409" style="s2">you had a great conversation with him</p>

<p begin="02:14:43.340" end="02:14:47.300" style="s2">her because no because the conversation</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.469" end="02:14:48.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have happened if I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.300" end="02:14:51.139" style="s2">observed your conversations okay them</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.920" end="02:14:52.369" style="s2">and I sort of watched but I&#39;ve observed</p>

<p begin="02:14:52.369" end="02:14:55.670" style="s2">guarantee you the next conversation I</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.110" end="02:14:56.960" style="s2">have with him yeah we&#39;ll still be worse</p>

<p begin="02:16:02.690" end="02:16:07.460" style="s2">had a much better experience of David</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.400" end="02:16:09.040" style="s2">Wolpe than I get so that&#39;s a and was a</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.460" end="02:16:13.430" style="s2">conjecture that there was more there</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.040" end="02:16:15.530" style="s2">yeah you know in part borne out well it</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.430" end="02:16:19.130" style="s2">was born from watching you guys interact</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.530" end="02:16:21.380" style="s2">and figuring that in fact I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.130" end="02:16:24.380" style="s2">David was particularly attached to the</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.380" end="02:16:27.190" style="s2">rigid interpretation of the text in a</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.380" end="02:16:30.260" style="s2">literal sense nor even to the concept of</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.190" end="02:16:32.270" style="s2">an anthropomorphic like deity oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.260" end="02:16:34.880" style="s2">know he&#39;s not and I mean the first time</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.270" end="02:16:37.760" style="s2">I debated him maybe it was the second</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.880" end="02:16:40.460" style="s2">time with hitch you know in one of the</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.760" end="02:16:43.280" style="s2">middle one of those debates I was sort</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.460" end="02:16:47.270" style="s2">of blindsided by his lack of commitment</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.280" end="02:16:50.660" style="s2">to a personal deity because I thought I</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.270" end="02:16:52.400" style="s2">said something that presupposed that he</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.660" end="02:16:55.190" style="s2">believed in a god that could hear our</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.400" end="02:16:56.960" style="s2">prayers and he said I wouldn&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.190" end="02:16:59.240" style="s2">it what makes you think I believe in a</p>
<p begin="02:16:56.960" end="02:17:01.460" style="s2">God who can hear prayers right and you</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.240" end="02:17:03.050" style="s2">know he&#39;s a conservative rabbi so this</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.460" end="02:17:05.440" style="s2">is you know this is a this was a</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.050" end="02:17:07.880" style="s2">surprise to me but anyway I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.440" end="02:17:09.950" style="s2">changed my view of what what to expect</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.880" end="02:17:13.550" style="s2">there as a result of that but still</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.950" end="02:17:17.060" style="s2">there are things he would say that would</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.550" end="02:17:18.770" style="s2">get me bogged down in the way that I got</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.060" end="02:17:22.340" style="s2">bogged down with Jordan Peterson in our</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.770" end="02:17:23.780" style="s2">first podcast with you know a bit debate</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.340" end="02:17:25.760" style="s2">a two-hour conversation about the nature</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.780" end="02:17:29.900" style="s2">of truth right now so with Jordan I had</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.760" end="02:17:31.580" style="s2">to decide okay because we&#39;ve just put a</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.900" end="02:17:34.520" style="s2">bunch of live events on the calendar and</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.580" end="02:17:36.530" style="s2">we need to find a way to have a an</p>
<p begin="02:17:34.520" end="02:17:37.550" style="s2">enjoyable conversation in addition to</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.530" end="02:17:40.250" style="s2">disagreeing where we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.550" end="02:17:41.870" style="s2">disagree I have to there has to be a</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.250" end="02:17:44.210" style="s2">different geometry to it here it just</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.870" end="02:17:47.240" style="s2">can&#39;t always just you know dive straight</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.210" end="02:17:48.860" style="s2">to the you know the into the the true</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.240" end="02:17:50.570" style="s2">basin of Attraction which is you know</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.860" end="02:17:53.090" style="s2">what let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.570" end="02:17:56.600" style="s2">exactly what you mean because I smell</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.090" end="02:17:58.551" style="s2">something fishy right so but so I</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.600" end="02:17:59.600" style="s2">thought it was great your conversation</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.551" end="02:18:00.890" style="s2">with David and I really enjoyed I</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.600" end="02:18:03.320" style="s2">learned a lot you know it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.890" end="02:18:04.880" style="s2">learned stuff from him that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.320" end="02:18:06.530" style="s2">learn had I been having the conversation</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.880" end="02:18:08.510" style="s2">because I wouldn&#39;t can&#39;t tell you how</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.530" end="02:18:10.010" style="s2">much that means to me thank you yeah so</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.510" end="02:18:13.370" style="s2">so I know I think what you&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.010" end="02:18:17.990" style="s2">is bound to be super unique because</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.370" end="02:18:21.920" style="s2">you&#39;re I mean not in a Europe you are a</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.990" end="02:18:24.770" style="s2">real polymath doing this and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.920" end="02:18:26.780" style="s2">a lot of people who are doing podcasts</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.770" end="02:18:28.160" style="s2">with the same kind of wealth of</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.780" end="02:18:30.680" style="s2">information you have on so many fronts</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.160" end="02:18:32.390" style="s2">so I I&#39;m flattered and I really</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.680" end="02:18:34.760" style="s2">appreciate what you&#39;re saying the odd</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.390" end="02:18:37.280" style="s2">thing is is that it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.760" end="02:18:39.590" style="s2">supposed to be an interview show mm-hm</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.280" end="02:18:42.110" style="s2">and we&#39;ve done a bunch of interviews in</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.590" end="02:18:43.970" style="s2">part you know Joe said something Joe</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.110" end="02:18:46.220" style="s2">Rogan said something to me early on and</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.970" end="02:18:47.600" style="s2">he said look at my earliest podcast he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.220" end="02:18:48.320" style="s2">like stop worrying about whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.600" end="02:18:50.510" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.320" end="02:18:52.760" style="s2">I was just clowning around with my</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.510" end="02:18:54.530" style="s2">friends with a webcam and I went back to</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.760" end="02:18:55.700" style="s2">the original Joe Rogan experiences and</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.530" end="02:18:58.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not kidding I haven&#39;t done that</p>
<p begin="02:18:55.700" end="02:19:00.830" style="s2">you&#39;ll enjoy the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.460" end="02:19:02.870" style="s2">people are really angry about everything</p>
<p begin="02:19:00.830" end="02:19:06.500" style="s2">that happens as I&#39;m beginning it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.870" end="02:19:09.230" style="s2">you know what why why is the glass on</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.500" end="02:19:11.660" style="s2">the edge of the table and you know the</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.230" end="02:19:15.520" style="s2">the plosives are too loud and you know</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.660" end="02:19:18.290" style="s2">that there&#39;s like a lot of stuff that is</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.520" end="02:19:20.600" style="s2">there there is no introductory period</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.290" end="02:19:22.880" style="s2">because weirdly this thing was discussed</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.600" end="02:19:24.710" style="s2">on the Rogen program and so we reviewed</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.880" end="02:19:26.450" style="s2">on Apple because of their ridiculous</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.710" end="02:19:27.830" style="s2">algorithm a number one eight hundred</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.450" end="02:19:29.750" style="s2">thousand podcast and you were number one</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.830" end="02:19:32.030" style="s2">exactly which I&#39;ve never been remotely</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.750" end="02:19:34.120" style="s2">close to since and even though the</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.030" end="02:19:36.140" style="s2">podcast has grown in listenership so</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.120" end="02:19:39.410" style="s2">partially what&#39;s happening is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.140" end="02:19:41.330" style="s2">just trying to find a format and to get</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.410" end="02:19:43.760" style="s2">comfortable with the idea but a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.330" end="02:19:46.460" style="s2">what it&#39;s supposed to do is to go into</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.760" end="02:19:48.771" style="s2">intellectual territory that isn&#39;t based</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.460" end="02:19:52.250" style="s2">on an interview with a guest to see</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.771" end="02:19:55.400" style="s2">whether or not we can bring an enormous</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.250" end="02:19:58.130" style="s2">number of people closer to the most</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.400" end="02:20:01.490" style="s2">transcendent solid intellectual</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.130" end="02:20:04.600" style="s2">achievement that is on offer because in</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.490" end="02:20:06.530" style="s2">general it feels to me like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.600" end="02:20:09.170" style="s2">Monastery where all the good stuff is</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.530" end="02:20:12.260" style="s2">kept and almost nobody ever visits or</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.170" end="02:20:14.350" style="s2">reads any of it right and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.260" end="02:20:18.080" style="s2">saying you&#39;re speaking specifically of</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.350" end="02:20:20.330" style="s2">your wheelhouse of physics no or just</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.080" end="02:20:24.680" style="s2">anything that interests you that by all</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.330" end="02:20:26.420" style="s2">of us music okay yep its language but</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.680" end="02:20:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just to make sure what I understand</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.420" end="02:20:29.990" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.680" end="02:20:32.690" style="s2">you&#39;re envisioning many podcasts being</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.990" end="02:20:34.550" style="s2">just you and a whiteboard or something</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.690" end="02:20:36.440" style="s2">where you&#39;re some kind of graphics so I</p>
<p begin="02:20:34.550" end="02:20:38.180" style="s2">think graphics are gonna be important</p>
<p begin="02:20:36.440" end="02:20:41.360" style="s2">right I think they&#39;re going to be some</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.180" end="02:20:42.950" style="s2">difficult topics that are gonna be</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.360" end="02:20:44.600" style="s2">pretty heavy going intellectually that</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.950" end="02:20:45.890" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try to make as easy as I can</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.600" end="02:20:48.700" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.890" end="02:20:52.570" style="s2">but to partially leverage the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.700" end="02:20:54.800" style="s2">and this is kind of a theme running</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.570" end="02:20:56.540" style="s2">below the surface which occasionally</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.800" end="02:20:59.660" style="s2">like magma comes up through through the</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.540" end="02:21:01.250" style="s2">crust because it was so difficult for me</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.660" end="02:21:02.570" style="s2">to understand anything that was going on</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.250" end="02:21:04.760" style="s2">in my junior high school in high school</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.570" end="02:21:07.550" style="s2">years because of symbolic issues and</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.760" end="02:21:09.560" style="s2">learning learning style differences a</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.550" end="02:21:12.620" style="s2">lot of what happened was that I was able</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.560" end="02:21:14.300" style="s2">to put things together out of sheer</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.620" end="02:21:16.460" style="s2">necessity without going through the</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.300" end="02:21:18.200" style="s2">symbolic channel and it&#39;s my belief that</p>
<p begin="02:21:16.460" end="02:21:20.360" style="s2">even if people don&#39;t see themselves like</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.200" end="02:21:22.970" style="s2">let&#39;s say learning-disabled mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.360" end="02:21:25.820" style="s2">that the symbolic channel is where we</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.970" end="02:21:28.250" style="s2">get stuck that most people if you show</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.820" end="02:21:30.200" style="s2">them a page of equations they turn out</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.250" end="02:21:31.970" style="s2">right and it&#39;s very difficult to figure</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.200" end="02:21:35.030" style="s2">out well what can you communicate that</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.970" end="02:21:38.810" style="s2">isn&#39;t an analogy but that actually gets</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.030" end="02:21:40.970" style="s2">people to an understanding of sort of</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.810" end="02:21:43.160" style="s2">that just the majesty of human</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.970" end="02:21:45.590" style="s2">intellectual achievement and so the hope</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.160" end="02:21:48.440" style="s2">is going to be that if we can get some</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.590" end="02:21:52.490" style="s2">some decent production values and get</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.440" end="02:21:55.420" style="s2">the add models to work that we can start</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.490" end="02:22:00.170" style="s2">experimenting with some sort of hybrid</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.420" end="02:22:03.021" style="s2">graphical and discussion and solo can be</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.170" end="02:22:05.750" style="s2">great yeah yeah and and I think you</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.021" end="02:22:08.120" style="s2">should explore it&#39;d be fascinating for</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.750" end="02:22:12.130" style="s2">you to explore the the alternative learn</p>

<p begin="02:22:12.130" end="02:22:17.870" style="s2">question I mean people would find that</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.190" end="02:22:19.550" style="s2">incredibly useful and inspire</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.870" end="02:22:21.620" style="s2">if you if you if you if there was</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.550" end="02:22:23.480" style="s2">something there to explore that would be</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.620" end="02:22:27.380" style="s2">especially if it would be actionable on</p>

<p begin="02:22:27.380" end="02:22:32.061" style="s2">many of us you know like I can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.351" end="02:22:34.820" style="s2">you how much hopelessness I produced my</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.061" end="02:22:38.180" style="s2">parents because no matter what I tried</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.820" end="02:22:40.700" style="s2">to do nothing worked and I know that</p>

<p begin="02:22:55.790" end="02:23:01.130" style="s2">the sort of learning disabled or</p>

<p begin="02:23:04.220" end="02:23:07.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve got dyslexia dysgraphia is</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.800" end="02:23:11.510" style="s2">something called kinesthetic</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.880" end="02:23:13.430" style="s2">reinforcement you know people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.510" end="02:23:15.140" style="s2">did did you get these as a teenager or</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.430" end="02:23:17.210" style="s2">something things were in their infancy</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.140" end="02:23:18.410" style="s2">back then there were batteries of tests</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.210" end="02:23:21.170" style="s2">that are different like you know there</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.410" end="02:23:23.360" style="s2">was this Kurdish word test when they</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.170" end="02:23:26.271" style="s2">assumed nobody knew Kurdish huh I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.360" end="02:23:29.960" style="s2">know Kurdish for sure and they tested to</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.271" end="02:23:32.410" style="s2">see whether you could remember a bunch</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.960" end="02:23:35.720" style="s2">of words you&#39;ve probably never seen and</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.410" end="02:23:38.120" style="s2">in one list you wrote them out and in</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.720" end="02:23:40.851" style="s2">one list you didn&#39;t to aid in the memory</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.120" end="02:23:44.930" style="s2">and so when I got back a test this was a</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.851" end="02:23:47.090" style="s2">at Harvard I was like very high 90s in</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.930" end="02:23:49.101" style="s2">lots of different areas than one area my</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.090" end="02:23:51.380" style="s2">score plummeted to like third percentile</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.101" end="02:23:53.330" style="s2">right I said what is that and we said</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.380" end="02:23:54.561" style="s2">well that&#39;s kinesthetic reinforcement I</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.330" end="02:23:56.420" style="s2">said well what does that mean they said</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.561" end="02:23:57.890" style="s2">well were you to take notes you would</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.420" end="02:24:00.620" style="s2">erase everything that you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.890" end="02:24:02.750" style="s2">right right and I said what did you just</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.620" end="02:24:07.070" style="s2">say and I realized that my note-taking</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.750" end="02:24:08.690" style="s2">had wiped out my entire education up to</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.070" end="02:24:11.450" style="s2">that point well now why would you have</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.690" end="02:24:14.330" style="s2">taken a test like this at Harvard I was</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.450" end="02:24:17.990" style="s2">struggling I was I was in the most</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.330" end="02:24:19.760" style="s2">symbolically dependent subject I mean at</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.990" end="02:24:22.910" style="s2">some point I&#39;ll get into my history in</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.760" end="02:24:27.080" style="s2">mathematics but there was no one</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.910" end="02:24:30.410" style="s2">remotely like me in my situation as a</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.080" end="02:24:31.551" style="s2">PhD student at Harvard and it was the</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.410" end="02:24:33.621" style="s2">worst pas</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.551" end="02:24:35.091" style="s2">a bowl a sensible miss you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.621" end="02:24:38.480" style="s2">mismatched you could imagine because</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.091" end="02:24:38.841" style="s2">math lives in symbols it isn&#39;t symbols</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.480" end="02:24:41.900" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.841" end="02:24:43.881" style="s2">but the symbols are really crucial for</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.900" end="02:24:46.070" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s going on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.881" end="02:24:49.161" style="s2">exactly where I&#39;m blocked and the hope</p>
<p begin="02:24:46.070" end="02:24:51.980" style="s2">that I have is if I can get around</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.161" end="02:24:54.501" style="s2">symbols in large measure for myself</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.980" end="02:24:56.661" style="s2">mmm can I do it for people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.501" end="02:24:58.341" style="s2">even necessarily blocked and learned yes</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.661" end="02:25:01.400" style="s2">I would love that because like I have</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.341" end="02:25:03.741" style="s2">you know I consider myself more or less</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.400" end="02:25:06.171" style="s2">you know by comparison in numerous</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.741" end="02:25:09.501" style="s2">because I got you know I took math you</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.171" end="02:25:11.001" style="s2">know in height in high school it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.501" end="02:25:13.070" style="s2">that I would I mean I was sort of</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.001" end="02:25:14.570" style="s2">equivalently good on both sucking both</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.070" end="02:25:16.281" style="s2">humanities in math I mean it was it was</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.570" end="02:25:19.311" style="s2">not obvious I shouldn&#39;t be pursuing math</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.281" end="02:25:22.730" style="s2">but I never you know like after once I</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.311" end="02:25:24.891" style="s2">did calculus in high school I just never</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.730" end="02:25:26.811" style="s2">got math like I never I never got what</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.891" end="02:25:29.031" style="s2">it was it was just work and I never</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.811" end="02:25:31.181" style="s2">really got it and then you know you know</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.031" end="02:25:34.131" style="s2">if you know I&#39;ve just taken you know</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.181" end="02:25:36.561" style="s2">mathematical logic and statistics you</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.131" end="02:25:38.751" style="s2">know at the college level but like my</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.561" end="02:25:42.860" style="s2">math education stopped at a point</p>
<p begin="02:25:38.751" end="02:25:45.561" style="s2">because I hit a wall of one just you</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.860" end="02:25:47.751" style="s2">know a lack of exposure to the beauty of</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.561" end="02:25:50.061" style="s2">it I mean I&#39;m like a fan of math now you</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.751" end="02:25:56.751" style="s2">know like I in terms of his broad</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.061" end="02:25:59.541" style="s2">concepts but I hid the burden of having</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.751" end="02:26:02.261" style="s2">to grapple learn the language of the</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.541" end="02:26:04.190" style="s2">symbolism was high enough that it just</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.261" end="02:26:05.781" style="s2">dissing crippling it was there was no</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.190" end="02:26:08.061" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough reason to struggle</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.781" end="02:26:10.101" style="s2">with it and I just you know I just my</p>

<p begin="02:26:10.101" end="02:26:15.591" style="s2">end up in part as this incredible</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.531" end="02:26:17.690" style="s2">superpower because and I talk about this</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.591" end="02:26:19.851" style="s2">in terms of color blindness so both my</p>

<p begin="02:26:19.851" end="02:26:26.211" style="s2">standard way but we make the point about</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.951" end="02:26:28.181" style="s2">contrast blindness because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.211" end="02:26:30.320" style="s2">trade-off between whether you see color</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.181" end="02:26:33.230" style="s2">better than others are worse or you know</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.320" end="02:26:35.061" style="s2">there you see contrast better so to the</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.230" end="02:26:37.581" style="s2">extent that what you see is learning</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.061" end="02:26:38.991" style="s2">disabilities is mysterious to you like</p>
<p begin="02:26:37.581" end="02:26:41.391" style="s2">why would this be retained in such a</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.991" end="02:26:43.431" style="s2">large portion of the population it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.391" end="02:26:45.561" style="s2">because I think it has the</p>

<p begin="02:26:49.400" end="02:26:52.671" style="s2">channels and like for example I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:51.410" end="02:26:55.610" style="s2">know whether you noticed the objects</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.671" end="02:26:58.551" style="s2">that are around here the klein bottles I</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.610" end="02:27:00.921" style="s2">said I I saw that yeah oh yeah I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.551" end="02:27:04.551" style="s2">been so example that&#39;s Beth Sheba</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.921" end="02:27:09.620" style="s2">Grossman&#39;s art huh that&#39;s a 24 cell</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.551" end="02:27:13.280" style="s2">which is the unique new analog of a</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.620" end="02:27:16.851" style="s2">platonic solid that is not found it it</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.280" end="02:27:18.530" style="s2">sorry the convex polytopes are the</p>
<p begin="02:27:16.851" end="02:27:20.870" style="s2">analogs of the platonic solids in</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.530" end="02:27:24.830" style="s2">dimension 4 this is pushed back into</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.870" end="02:27:27.410" style="s2">dimension 3 and that&#39;s the unique convex</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.830" end="02:27:29.541" style="s2">polytope that has no analog directly in</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.410" end="02:27:31.521" style="s2">dimension 3 so then the other one that</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.541" end="02:27:33.471" style="s2">you have there is the analog of the</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.521" end="02:27:36.471" style="s2">don&#39;t want to me that this is a a 3</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.471" end="02:27:39.440" style="s2">dimensional projection of a 4</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.471" end="02:27:42.101" style="s2">dimensional object so like you know if</p>
<p begin="02:27:39.440" end="02:27:45.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen the tesseract that is the</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.101" end="02:27:49.721" style="s2">hypercube which is the 3-dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.200" end="02:27:52.700" style="s2">model that represents a four dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.721" end="02:27:55.280" style="s2">structure right this right here is</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.700" end="02:27:57.561" style="s2">pretty directly the analog of the</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.280" end="02:27:59.870" style="s2">dodecahedron in four dimensions</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.561" end="02:28:05.271" style="s2">projected back into three dimensions now</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.870" end="02:28:10.551" style="s2">when you and again this is my topology</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.271" end="02:28:14.291" style="s2">is a layman&#39;s topology but the are some</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.551" end="02:28:18.021" style="s2">projections back into three dimensions</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.291" end="02:28:20.150" style="s2">far more evocative of of the four</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.021" end="02:28:22.461" style="s2">dimensional object yeah then I want to</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.150" end="02:28:25.360" style="s2">see a lot of them so that you could see</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.461" end="02:28:29.091" style="s2">so that you could understand right so</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.360" end="02:28:31.131" style="s2">how do you have an internal sense of how</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.091" end="02:28:33.471" style="s2">much you understand or don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.131" end="02:28:35.501" style="s2">the higher dimensionality of an object</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.471" end="02:28:39.320" style="s2">based on the it&#39;s three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.501" end="02:28:41.931" style="s2">well for example if we took a regular</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.320" end="02:28:44.240" style="s2">Klein bottle here right and for those of</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.931" end="02:28:46.070" style="s2">you at home I guess we should be talking</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.240" end="02:28:50.961" style="s2">about what we&#39;re doing on video yeah</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.070" end="02:28:53.091" style="s2">right so I have a glass bottle where the</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.961" end="02:28:56.001" style="s2">neck has been passed through to what</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.091" end="02:28:57.801" style="s2">would be called the punt and in three</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.001" end="02:28:59.209" style="s2">dimensions that appears to intersect the</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.801" end="02:29:00.680" style="s2">side of the bottle</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.209" end="02:29:03.079" style="s2">but if you had an extra dimension</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.680" end="02:29:05.060" style="s2">represented by the amount of blueness in</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.079" end="02:29:07.909" style="s2">the bottle and we colored this blue in</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.060" end="02:29:10.609" style="s2">the bell layer here you could see</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.909" end="02:29:12.229" style="s2">literally in four dimensions this</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.609" end="02:29:13.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t intersect itself because this</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.229" end="02:29:14.720" style="s2">part of the glass would be clear and</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.549" end="02:29:16.850" style="s2">that part of the glass would be blue</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.720" end="02:29:18.409" style="s2">hence they&#39;re separated by some</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.850" end="02:29:21.289" style="s2">dimension that we can&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.409" end="02:29:22.970" style="s2">spatially right so by mixing spatial</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.289" end="02:29:24.859" style="s2">dimensions with colored dimensions I</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.970" end="02:29:26.510" style="s2">claim you can actually see in four</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.859" end="02:29:29.270" style="s2">dimensions that this thing doesn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.510" end="02:29:31.640" style="s2">into itself the Klein bottle appears to</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.270" end="02:29:34.489" style="s2">intersect mathematically there&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.640" end="02:29:37.989" style="s2">that the same logic as a mobius strip is</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.489" end="02:29:43.189" style="s2">it to mobius bands sewn together okay</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.989" end="02:29:46.159" style="s2">right now the point that I was making is</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.189" end="02:29:47.779" style="s2">that that is an example of an object</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.159" end="02:29:50.479" style="s2">where you don&#39;t realize you can see four</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.779" end="02:29:53.119" style="s2">dimensions by just adding a color</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.479" end="02:29:55.939" style="s2">dimension to spatial dimensions right so</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.119" end="02:29:58.399" style="s2">I can give you lots of intuition pumps</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.939" end="02:30:00.289" style="s2">to this is what I did on the rogen</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.399" end="02:30:02.209" style="s2">program with the hopf fibration i called</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.289" end="02:30:03.499" style="s2">it the most important object in the</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.209" end="02:30:06.560" style="s2">universe not because the hopf fibration</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.499" end="02:30:08.390" style="s2">is but it&#39;s the only example of a</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.560" end="02:30:10.789" style="s2">principal fiber bundle which is the</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.390" end="02:30:14.839" style="s2">underpinning of really the most</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.789" end="02:30:17.479" style="s2">fundamental physics we have hmm and my</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.839" end="02:30:19.819" style="s2">intention is to read one paragraph of Ed</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.479" end="02:30:21.770" style="s2">Witten with my audience so you know</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.819" end="02:30:23.600" style="s2">Oprah has a book club or had a book club</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.770" end="02:30:25.879" style="s2">right so I&#39;m gonna just try to get</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.600" end="02:30:27.260" style="s2">through one paragraph which i think is</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.879" end="02:30:29.180" style="s2">the most important paragraph ever</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.260" end="02:30:30.770" style="s2">written in the English language not</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.180" end="02:30:32.379" style="s2">because it Witten&#39;s prose is so</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.770" end="02:30:36.140" style="s2">beautiful not because it&#39;s free of error</p>
<p begin="02:30:32.379" end="02:30:38.270" style="s2">but because it actually makes an attempt</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.140" end="02:30:41.089" style="s2">to say what our most deep notions of</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.270" end="02:30:42.979" style="s2">reality are in a single paragraph with</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.089" end="02:30:46.189" style="s2">relatively few symbols and unknown words</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.979" end="02:30:47.810" style="s2">so maybe to do a paragraph club where</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.189" end="02:30:52.220" style="s2">other people do a book club or the</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.810" end="02:30:54.459" style="s2">awesome the hope is to really start off</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.220" end="02:30:56.539" style="s2">with conversations but if people are</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.459" end="02:30:59.270" style="s2">following along at home and they say</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.539" end="02:31:00.919" style="s2">where&#39;s the portal we&#39;re just getting</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.270" end="02:31:03.169" style="s2">started this is the open these are the</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.919" end="02:31:06.199" style="s2">opening shots yeah but I would encourage</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.169" end="02:31:07.669" style="s2">you as a even as a side gig to the</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.199" end="02:31:09.260" style="s2">portal maybe this is not podcast</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.669" end="02:31:12.440" style="s2">material this maybe this is a online</p>
<p begin="02:31:09.260" end="02:31:15.771" style="s2">course or something but to find a route</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.440" end="02:31:18.230" style="s2">in two higher mathematics for the symbol</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.771" end="02:31:20.360" style="s2">blocked yeah but I want to do that want</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.230" end="02:31:23.570" style="s2">to music I want to do the unity of</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.360" end="02:31:26.780" style="s2">knowledge all the stuff that people</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.570" end="02:31:29.030" style="s2">don&#39;t even know is out there to be found</p>
<p begin="02:31:26.780" end="02:31:31.311" style="s2">because I believe that you know I call</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.030" end="02:31:33.200" style="s2">this transcendence hacking that the</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.311" end="02:31:35.811" style="s2">feeling of transcendence that often</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.200" end="02:31:40.910" style="s2">induces religious feelings is really</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.811" end="02:31:44.150" style="s2">better purposed as a guide to what is it</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.910" end="02:31:46.851" style="s2">what is worth paying special notice</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.150" end="02:31:49.311" style="s2">towards in a world drowning in</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.851" end="02:31:51.290" style="s2">distraction hmm and that feeling of oh</p>
<p begin="02:31:49.311" end="02:31:53.240" style="s2">my god like this thing here I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:31:51.290" end="02:31:57.261" style="s2">if you&#39;ve seen this no I&#39;m pointing at a</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.240" end="02:31:59.601" style="s2">crystal cube that is a three dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.261" end="02:32:02.421" style="s2">projection of an eight dimensional root</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.601" end="02:32:05.330" style="s2">system of the 248 dimensional</p>

<p begin="02:32:13.101" end="02:32:16.761" style="s2">was I abandoned the name guy Garrett</p>
<p begin="02:32:15.471" end="02:32:20.301" style="s2">Lisi yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.761" end="02:32:22.341" style="s2">but everyone should know that it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.301" end="02:32:23.410" style="s2">and worry about it</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.341" end="02:32:25.580" style="s2">whether they&#39;re a professional</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.410" end="02:32:26.900" style="s2">mathematician or not so the idea I</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.580" end="02:32:29.391" style="s2">wasn&#39;t planning to talk about the</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.900" end="02:32:30.980" style="s2">objects is to leave Easter eggs and</p>
<p begin="02:32:29.391" end="02:32:32.900" style="s2">clues all over the place so that people</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.980" end="02:32:36.021" style="s2">start to have bitchu ate themselves to</p>
<p begin="02:32:32.900" end="02:32:38.480" style="s2">the idea that you don&#39;t need angels or</p>

<p begin="02:32:38.480" end="02:32:42.440" style="s2">something that gives you the feeling</p>
<p begin="02:32:40.700" end="02:32:44.301" style="s2">that maybe we&#39;re not totally alone and</p>
<p begin="02:32:42.440" end="02:32:46.521" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have to be an animal thing</p>
