<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">necessary have to answer within that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">context but that is how I generally look</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">at it like what am I willing to let go</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">of in those areas interests in general</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">whatever comes up I had I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">about this this morning had look what am</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:46.460" style="s2">I ready to let go of I don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:46.460" style="s2">do you want to start we don&#39;t meet you I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.930" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">can go first it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:56.789" style="s2">because I was part of the reason why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">sometimes late is because I have a call</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.789" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">right before this and so we try and end</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">a few minutes early but we really like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:05.070" style="s2">talking to each other and so sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll get wrapped up in something and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.070" end="00:01:16.650" style="s2">I&#39;ll take it right out up to the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">and and so in that context you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.650" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">like you know that question of Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">and what am i ready to let go of I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">a tendency to be strongly identified</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">with being someone who is intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">and as a result I am in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">where I don&#39;t feel like I am intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">or I somehow feel like I&#39;m I used the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">word I used the word simpleton last</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">night like I feel incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">uncomfortable and so I guess part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">what I&#39;m ready to let go of is that my</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">identification with that intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">part of me and that somehow that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">intelligence is a determination of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:09.020" style="s2">worth as a person and what else am I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:09.020" style="s2">willing to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">the other thing that was coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.790" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">the conversation I was just having was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">what kind of the embarrassment I feel at</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.130" end="00:02:33.770" style="s2">being the embarrassment I feel at like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:38.270" style="s2">if someone I know has a hold the belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.770" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">that some people like it&#39;s like I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.270" end="00:02:43.790" style="s2">this tendency to look at people I care</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:46.880" style="s2">about through the lens of other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:49.010" style="s2">that I know and you know that that sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.880" end="00:02:51.410" style="s2">of guilty by association and so letting</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.010" end="00:02:55.520" style="s2">go you know I want to continue to let go</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.410" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">of not caring about what other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.520" end="00:03:00.740" style="s2">think because as a human I&#39;m designed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:07.940" style="s2">care about what other people think like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.740" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">that&#39;s normal but to let go of that fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.940" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">of being rejected if I don&#39;t fit in yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:16.250" style="s2">if so you know if somebody dislikes me</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:23.450" style="s2">because of somebody I&#39;m associated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.250" end="00:03:25.400" style="s2">then that would be then that&#39;s the fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.450" end="00:03:27.080" style="s2">of being rejected I think is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.400" end="00:03:29.990" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m that I&#39;m more afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.080" end="00:03:33.700" style="s2">than what people actually think and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.990" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">being willing to let go of that fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.700" end="00:03:38.690" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know far</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">thank Simon John wrote you myself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.690" end="00:03:46.550" style="s2">with only two of us I didn&#39;t even eat</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:48.680" style="s2">myself mine&#39;s very similar when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.550" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">ready to let go of I&#39;ve written here</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.680" end="00:03:53.750" style="s2">what you said is that like intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t equal my worth um I&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.750" end="00:03:57.020" style="s2">deal with that so I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">intelligence is equally my worth anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.020" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">but I still get into that mode sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">when I&#39;m ready to let go of his stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:06.440" style="s2">that was coming up this week it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">not speaking my truth because it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.440" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">hurt someone&#39;s feelings and not like me</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:13.580" style="s2">not needing to not offend and not hurt</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:15.530" style="s2">people which keeps me from from being</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.580" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">fully who I am and saying what I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.530" end="00:04:19.700" style="s2">to say which then stops everything from</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:22.910" style="s2">going because I said something that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.700" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">misconstrued and me and the person dealt</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.910" end="00:04:24.830" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:26.300" style="s2">it was actually really great vigor I if</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.830" end="00:04:28.340" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t said the thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:33.979" style="s2">normally what I would have done so like</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.340" end="00:04:35.419" style="s2">giving up what it is that then I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.979" end="00:04:37.039" style="s2">possibly think of all the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.419" end="00:04:39.410" style="s2">layers that could hurt someone because</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.039" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">when I was even doing that it still hurt</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.410" end="00:04:43.610" style="s2">someone and letting go that that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.810" end="00:04:44.990" style="s2">responsibility at all letting go that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.610" end="00:04:47.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a right way to do in the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.990" end="00:04:49.430" style="s2">place what is right kind of emerges and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.930" end="00:04:51.259" style="s2">it&#39;s about dealing with I can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.430" end="00:04:52.910" style="s2">and change it anyway so why not you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.259" end="00:04:54.710" style="s2">continue moving forward and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.910" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">repairing it and looking at with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.710" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">can we learn from this having happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">and this other thing that kept like</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:04.610" style="s2">sitting with me weirdly this week is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:06.229" style="s2">this this is posted to boarding</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.610" end="00:05:09.590" style="s2">broadcasts on it was like the shopping</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.229" end="00:05:10.850" style="s2">cart catalyst or litmus test for whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.590" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">or not you&#39;re a good human being is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.850" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">whether or not you returned a shopping</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:15.349" style="s2">cart and I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:17.210" style="s2">you&#39;re good humans whether you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.349" end="00:05:18.650" style="s2">handle self-governance because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.210" end="00:05:19.820" style="s2">something that&#39;s illegal it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.650" end="00:05:21.530" style="s2">you do it if you&#39;re doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:24.050" style="s2">thing and there&#39;s no reason to not do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.530" end="00:05:26.900" style="s2">and there&#39;s so much wrong with that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:30.099" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been sitting with me but I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:32.449" style="s2">like no my version of self-governance is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.099" end="00:05:33.770" style="s2">you return the shopping cart if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.449" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s the right thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.770" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">assume goodwill in those who haven&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:38.900" style="s2">it really bothers you the shopping carts</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">all over the place then do it if it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.900" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">easy right like just clean him up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">move them back but anyway I had to tell</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:45.760" style="s2">that story to say that like the irony</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:47.659" style="s2">and all of that what I was unlike</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.760" end="00:05:50.180" style="s2">self-governing is basically governing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.659" end="00:05:51.860" style="s2">yourself but in me like I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.180" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">self-govern what other people&#39;s version</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.860" end="00:05:56.210" style="s2">of self-governance is right because</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a layer thereof we can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.210" end="00:06:00.409" style="s2">each other we can only do ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:02.449" style="s2">the problem with the shopping cart is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.409" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">that it and it triggers the person right</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.449" end="00:06:05.659" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s like there and it annoys</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">you it&#39;s not the actual shopping cart</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.659" end="00:06:11.720" style="s2">although there are problems with that as</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:14.090" style="s2">well and so letting go of things needing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.720" end="00:06:15.409" style="s2">to be my way even if I can like fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.090" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">logically heart-space</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.409" end="00:06:20.900" style="s2">everything see that it&#39;s the right way</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like the irony of of like needing</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:25.099" style="s2">people&#39;s version of self-governance to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:26.270" style="s2">include the diversity of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.099" end="00:06:27.949" style="s2">while not allowing them to have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.270" end="00:06:29.479" style="s2">diversity of the individual you don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.949" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">mean that&#39;s their self-governance and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.479" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know letting go that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.980" style="s2">universe makes sense in the most in like</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:39.650" style="s2">the most beautiful way like right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.980" end="00:06:41.570" style="s2">gonna keep being sarcastically ironic</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.650" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">and I love it and I&#39;m gonna let go I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.570" end="00:06:45.200" style="s2">trying to make sense of it a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">course about and continually make sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.200" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">of it but letting go of like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:50.930" style="s2">rigidity of like holding to that sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of fun to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.930" end="00:06:56.840" style="s2">the self-governed about their self</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">governing it&#39;s like yeah but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:02.890" style="s2">we need to do it if you fix the world so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:02.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just beep in that space is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.330" end="00:07:17.270" style="s2">like another sorry to write that what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.350" end="00:07:25.210" style="s2">that made me think of is you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.270" end="00:07:30.860" style="s2">letting go or maybe more more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.210" end="00:07:36.340" style="s2">being willing to let go of the story of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.860" end="00:07:39.710" style="s2">what other people&#39;s behavior means</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.340" end="00:07:41.270" style="s2">because the thing that annoys you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.710" end="00:07:44.600" style="s2">like when when I get annoyed with</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.270" end="00:07:48.790" style="s2">somebody else it&#39;s the story it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.600" end="00:07:53.600" style="s2">projection I have about what their</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.790" end="00:07:56.110" style="s2">behavior means and like I&#39;m not always</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.600" end="00:07:58.700" style="s2">willing to let go because sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.110" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">want to hold on to my self-righteous you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.700" end="00:08:03.500" style="s2">know feelings of indignation like cuz</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:05.570" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s a warm blanket that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.500" end="00:08:10.010" style="s2">like feels good and I just want to hold</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.570" end="00:08:14.150" style="s2">onto it and you know but but yeah having</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.010" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">you know you know there coz that what am</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:27.200" style="s2">would add another question to that or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.850" end="00:08:29.300" style="s2">like a slight variation which is what am</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.200" end="00:08:32.360" style="s2">i ready to be willing to let go of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.300" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not ready to let it</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:40.820" style="s2">but I&#39;m I&#39;m ready to be willing to let</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:42.830" style="s2">it go like that&#39;s because sometimes all</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.820" end="00:08:45.290" style="s2">I can do is be willing to let go you</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.290" end="00:08:51.020" style="s2">let go and maybe that&#39;s implied within</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.140" end="00:08:59.480" style="s2">the question but you know so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.020" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">willing to let go of my my internal</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:06.890" style="s2">model of someone else that is causing me</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:10.390" style="s2">to you know judge them or make them</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.890" end="00:09:10.390" style="s2">wrong for their actions</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:22.430" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry for my tardiness thank you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.990" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">normally are here before before we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.430" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">started I was playing chess a lot second</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.170" style="s2">time it happened like how its chassis</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">were playing them yeah I just got into</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.170" end="00:09:35.990" style="s2">it there&#39;s this toy this is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:39.260" style="s2">interruption but is this girl on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.990" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">who&#39;s doing these analyses of alpha</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.260" end="00:09:42.950" style="s2">zeros games and it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">is this computer plate just it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.950" end="00:09:45.770" style="s2">been taught how to play right so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:47.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have all of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.770" end="00:09:48.890" style="s2">openings in its files and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.480" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">kind of doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not burdened with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.890" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">any of that it&#39;s just been told the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:09:53.660" style="s2">rules and the objectives and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:55.280" style="s2">figured it out itself and it plays</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.660" end="00:09:56.750" style="s2">completely differently right just values</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.280" end="00:09:59.060" style="s2">things completely different it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.750" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">realized my interest in the game so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.060" end="00:10:06.410" style="s2">started playing again I was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.260" end="00:10:08.030" style="s2">like ready to let go of and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.410" end="00:10:10.310" style="s2">actually like all this this is in no way</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.030" end="00:10:11.900" style="s2">a slight ahead you&#39;re like who needs a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.310" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">clock like who needs to show up to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.900" end="00:10:15.020" style="s2">things like what is it this</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">I kind of wonder what society would look</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.020" end="00:10:19.640" style="s2">like in that regard like we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.520" style="s2">party at some point we&#39;re happy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.640" end="00:10:27.430" style="s2">at some point my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.520" end="00:10:29.900" style="s2">that&#39;s actually very like much how</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.430" end="00:10:31.850" style="s2">Middle Eastern society works like they</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.900" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">don&#39;t adhere they don&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.850" end="00:10:35.110" style="s2">clocks like if you&#39;re if you go up like</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:37.370" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.110" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">people who are doing business with</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.370" end="00:10:41.780" style="s2">people who are like especially in Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:45.380" style="s2">Arabia I think that if you&#39;re if you go</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.780" end="00:10:48.340" style="s2">there like be prepared that something</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.380" end="00:10:50.780" style="s2">that starts at 2:00 like that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.340" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">suggestion of what time it might start</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.780" end="00:10:56.690" style="s2">and like I have no I&#39;ve never been able</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.070" end="00:10:58.340" style="s2">to verify that but that would be really</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.690" end="00:11:00.790" style="s2">interesting like what would it be if</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.340" end="00:11:02.900" style="s2">everyone you know if everyone like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.790" end="00:11:04.430" style="s2">nobody really paid attention to clocks</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.900" end="00:11:06.890" style="s2">like so this pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.430" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">recent Kira it&#39;s really recent it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.890" end="00:11:10.940" style="s2">150 years that&#39;s all it is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:12.980" style="s2">obsession with what time it isn&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.940" end="00:11:14.600" style="s2">on time stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s only since</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.980" end="00:11:16.010" style="s2">trains started running is only since we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.600" end="00:11:18.290" style="s2">need the timetables for trains that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.010" end="00:11:19.700" style="s2">that&#39;s when it all stirred at everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.290" end="00:11:22.130" style="s2">was like it now is in Saudi Arabia it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.700" end="00:11:23.959" style="s2">was always like that would you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.130" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">about like the faster it gets the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.959" end="00:11:27.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like that right the more first all</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.399" end="00:11:28.850" style="s2">our coordinating time zones and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.320" end="00:11:30.440" style="s2">what I mean and so we kind of need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.850" end="00:11:32.209" style="s2">know this start expand otherwise we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.440" end="00:11:33.800" style="s2">like the game be coffee shop of great</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.209" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">and idea but there&#39;s no in there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.800" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have you know stuff to do we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">all so busy doing so know exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:52.490" style="s2">any waiting around for four hours for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:53.779" style="s2">thing to start right and therefore like</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.490" end="00:12:00.920" style="s2">time becomes money and then it does</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.779" end="00:12:03.020" style="s2">become like three minutes yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.920" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">know do you want to share the what do</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.020" end="00:12:10.660" style="s2">you what what am I prepared to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:18.680" style="s2">kind of thing all right something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.660" end="00:12:22.010" style="s2">the one you yeah yeah it&#39;s funny I find</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.680" end="00:12:25.010" style="s2">this the hardest one because I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.010" end="00:12:26.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve let go of a lot but over the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.010" end="00:12:29.270" style="s2">few but then it&#39;s been not hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.839" end="00:12:30.830" style="s2">to do so right and so how much of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.270" end="00:12:32.390" style="s2">lesson go is it if it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.830" end="00:12:35.000" style="s2">hard to do right I mean I think it needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.390" end="00:12:36.290" style="s2">to be needs to feel like a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.000" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">otherwise you don&#39;t actually letting go</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.290" end="00:12:38.660" style="s2">of anything right you&#39;re not attached to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:40.220" style="s2">it in the first place and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.660" end="00:12:42.709" style="s2">probably not letting go but really do</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:44.300" style="s2">you know what I mean so yeah I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.709" end="00:12:48.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve always struggled out of it a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.300" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">bit and so I wonder if I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.770" end="00:12:53.570" style="s2">withholding things that I that I am very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.950" style="s2">loath to let go of but I&#39;m unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.570" end="00:12:57.589" style="s2">doing that you know what I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.950" end="00:12:59.329" style="s2">I I wonder about that sometimes because</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.589" end="00:13:00.589" style="s2">letting go of the job and letting go of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.329" end="00:13:05.180" style="s2">the house and letting go of the daily</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.589" end="00:13:08.420" style="s2">routine and and and and you know taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.180" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">up a much different kind of that was all</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.420" end="00:13:11.779" style="s2">quite easy for me despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:12.860" style="s2">family and friends didn&#39;t really get it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.779" end="00:13:14.450" style="s2">what are you doing you&#39;re rushing into</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.860" end="00:13:16.130" style="s2">things give it you know give it some</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.450" end="00:13:17.900" style="s2">thought take some pirate blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.130" end="00:13:19.940" style="s2">blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.900" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">I found all that quite easy but then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.940" end="00:13:24.110" style="s2">don&#39;t have entanglements of kids</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:26.030" style="s2">long-term relation fit you know serious</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.110" end="00:13:27.650" style="s2">like my own business anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.030" end="00:13:30.650" style="s2">nav any of those kinds of entanglements</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.650" end="00:13:32.540" style="s2">so that makes it somewhat easier so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.650" end="00:13:34.340" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know that the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.540" end="00:13:36.890" style="s2">example I can think of of something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.340" end="00:13:39.740" style="s2">I do not let go of that I would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.890" end="00:13:44.360" style="s2">like to although is smoking right there</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.740" end="00:13:47.000" style="s2">especially tobacco especially and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.360" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">something I struggle to let go of I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.000" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">done on occasion in my life but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:55.730" style="s2">struggled to do so significant long-term</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:57.560" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s kind of where I am on it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.730" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">I you know it seems to me I I can give</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.560" end="00:14:02.510" style="s2">up the big stuff easily with the small</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">stuff sort of peoples and things around</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.510" end="00:14:06.770" style="s2">I wonder how much of this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.540" end="00:14:08.540" style="s2">just like the first time I&#39;m answering</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.770" end="00:14:10.280" style="s2">these questions with people right how</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.540" end="00:14:12.770" style="s2">much we can also like invite each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.280" end="00:14:14.180" style="s2">to eat let things go right because when</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.670" end="00:14:20.990" style="s2">it has to be a struggle to let something</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.530" end="00:14:23.500" style="s2">go write it up they can be easy and fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.990" end="00:14:26.120" style="s2">like I know one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.500" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2">willing to let go of but not yet ready</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:30.200" style="s2">to let go of is my parent marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.860" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like okay to Lou nuria me</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.200" end="00:14:33.530" style="s2">like putting those things on it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.410" style="s2">like it&#39;s too hard right now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.530" end="00:14:39.290" style="s2">there&#39;s like all this stuff I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.410" end="00:14:40.100" style="s2">not capable completely yet I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.290" end="00:14:42.530" style="s2">to be ready</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.100" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">and that was what Kyra was mentioned was</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.530" end="00:14:45.710" style="s2">this difference in the question between</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.970" end="00:14:47.150" style="s2">what am i ready to let go over what am i</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.710" end="00:14:52.340" style="s2">Williams like both and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.150" end="00:14:53.720" style="s2">like in there of that the beginning part</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.340" end="00:14:56.600" style="s2">that ain&#39;t clean that like I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.720" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2">to want to let go of this technology and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.600" end="00:15:01.310" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard and then when is wit for</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.300" end="00:15:02.900" style="s2">me anyway I know it&#39;s only ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.310" end="00:15:04.760" style="s2">letting go of when it actually is easy</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.900" end="00:15:06.380" style="s2">but it feels that shitty and a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.760" end="00:15:07.340" style="s2">is the outside world tell you no no no</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.380" end="00:15:09.140" style="s2">no no no don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.340" end="00:15:10.400" style="s2">right don&#39;t buy the farm that&#39;s not take</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.140" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">some time think about it but your</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.400" end="00:15:14.030" style="s2">internal stuff then kind of clicks right</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">it becomes somewhat easier because</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.030" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">you&#39;re like that push back instead of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:21.110" style="s2">making afraid my life anyone&#39;s it making</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.170" end="00:15:22.760" style="s2">me second-guess it makes me stand firmer</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.110" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">in it and then that&#39;s how I know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.760" end="00:15:27.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like my thing to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:28.970" style="s2">different than just doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:31.250" style="s2">they say to or not doing it cuz they say</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.970" end="00:15:31.710" style="s2">not to like that willingness to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.250" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.710" end="00:15:35.400" style="s2">I guess is what I had talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.420" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">during my letting people go are letting</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.400" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">it go it&#39;s like the need to fix</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">everything saving the world&#39;s on me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">willing not yet ready with a little wet</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:50.790" style="s2">bag of the I had the same reaction in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:52.740" style="s2">Jubilee of Eric&#39;s that the idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.790" end="00:15:54.570" style="s2">has to be something that that it has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.740" end="00:15:58.260" style="s2">be painful it has to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.570" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2">is you know it it can be like one of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.260" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">teachers she talks about how you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:05.250" style="s2">depends on on on how you want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:14.970" style="s2">the lesson like if you want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.250" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">hard it can be hard if that is or if</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.970" end="00:16:18.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what you need because for some</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.180" style="s2">people that&#39;s what they need but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.300" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">but it also doesn&#39;t have to be hard and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.180" end="00:16:25.320" style="s2">yeah I guess I guess the point I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:28.020" style="s2">making that if it&#39;s not hard then</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.320" end="00:16:29.790" style="s2">there&#39;s no actual letting go it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.020" end="00:16:31.140" style="s2">kind of slipped away on it stoned you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.790" end="00:16:33.200" style="s2">see what I mean that&#39;s that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.140" end="00:16:37.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the point I was making and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.200" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">great I do understand you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.650" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">I do have in my head the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:43.170" style="s2">somewhere that letting go of stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">hard I do have that in me somewhere so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.170" end="00:16:48.330" style="s2">no it&#39;s good you&#39;ve highlighted it well</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:50.610" style="s2">in the next question that I would ask no</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.330" end="00:16:52.890" style="s2">Eric would be how long have you been</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:17:00.630" style="s2">thinking about doing that before you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.890" end="00:17:02.370" style="s2">it oh not really very long at all I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.630" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">I did rush into it but I was sure I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.370" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">wanted to do it so great sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:11.580" style="s2">know sometimes it&#39;s like things line up</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">and all of a sudden it&#39;s like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.580" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">this this thing makes perfect sense so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:27.959" style="s2">you know it&#39;s sorry you know moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">towards grabbing hold of something new</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.959" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">rather than a letting go of anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">yeah and I guess that&#39;s I mean comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:38.610" style="s2">back comes down to you the crux of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.250" style="s2">one of the ideas behind game B is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.610" end="00:17:42.750" style="s2">you know instead of destroying what you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.250" end="00:17:45.539" style="s2">don&#39;t want or tearing down what you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.750" end="00:17:48.090" style="s2">don&#39;t want building something better</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.539" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like if you&#39;re moving to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.090" end="00:17:51.960" style="s2">know if you&#39;re moving towards something</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:53.549" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.960" end="00:17:56.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a big question is am i we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.549" end="00:17:59.369" style="s2">moving in the direction of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.039" end="00:18:02.369" style="s2">that I want or am i moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.369" end="00:18:04.409" style="s2">something I don&#39;t want because no right</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.369" end="00:18:06.269" style="s2">but yeah because moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.409" end="00:18:07.889" style="s2">something I don&#39;t want then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.269" end="00:18:10.859" style="s2">probably something that I haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.889" end="00:18:18.479" style="s2">with yet you know that I need to deal</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.859" end="00:18:21.239" style="s2">with and so yeah I think you know to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.479" end="00:18:23.340" style="s2">that the crux of so much of why we end</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.239" end="00:18:26.669" style="s2">up or white at least in the United</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.340" end="00:18:29.809" style="s2">States like 50% of marriages end in</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.669" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">divorce and is because it&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.809" end="00:18:34.859" style="s2">move you know it&#39;s like well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">want this well what is it that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.859" end="00:18:38.070" style="s2">want do you do not want the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:39.929" style="s2">uncomfortable feelings that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.070" end="00:18:41.489" style="s2">to the surface now granted there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.929" end="00:18:43.529" style="s2">certain situations where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.489" end="00:18:47.369" style="s2">perfect sense but if you&#39;re not if</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.529" end="00:18:49.139" style="s2">you&#39;re moving away from something versus</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.369" end="00:18:51.509" style="s2">towards something you know there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.139" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">different lessons yeah that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.509" end="00:18:56.129" style="s2">the 50% of marriages end in divorce</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:58.409" style="s2">contains within it an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.129" end="00:19:01.109" style="s2">assumption that that&#39;s a bad thing right</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.409" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">that all marriages should last forever</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.109" end="00:19:07.349" style="s2">and that that&#39;s a presupposition with</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:10.349" style="s2">which I disagree right the you know this</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.349" end="00:19:12.629" style="s2">this this idea of two people staying</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.349" end="00:19:14.700" style="s2">together for 30 40 50 years to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.629" end="00:19:18.419" style="s2">exclusion of all others i I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.700" end="00:19:20.009" style="s2">that that necessarily you know like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.419" end="00:19:22.440" style="s2">that seems to me to be very much of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.009" end="00:19:26.460" style="s2">quite recently there&#39;s a specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.440" end="00:19:28.229" style="s2">analogy that is like if you&#39;re in a for</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:29.639" style="s2">a marriage is kind of a contract to stay</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.229" end="00:19:31.349" style="s2">together forever I mean I think in every</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.639" end="00:19:34.169" style="s2">society that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.349" end="00:19:36.029" style="s2">here and yet there comes a point where</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.169" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">the pain outweighs what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.029" end="00:19:40.259" style="s2">from it and so the quote for some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:41.639" style="s2">the right thing to do is to stay in and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.259" end="00:19:43.289" style="s2">work through it and for some people the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.639" end="00:19:45.090" style="s2">right thing is to is to move on how do</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.289" end="00:19:47.279" style="s2">you know both of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.090" end="00:19:48.690" style="s2">letting go both of those things are like</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.279" end="00:19:49.799" style="s2">letting go that the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.690" end="00:19:52.109" style="s2">supposed to look like it&#39;s supposed to</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.510" end="00:20:24.810" style="s2">at least in the United States there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:32.760" style="s2">last 30 40 whatever years maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">everyone&#39;s supposed to get married</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.760" end="00:20:36.360" style="s2">that&#39;s all so the expectation is that</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.360" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">gets married well maybe maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.670" end="00:20:49.530" style="s2">flawed assumption also maybe there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:53.730" style="s2">like Jordan Peterson&#39;s framing on this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.530" end="00:20:57.420" style="s2">of like you are shackling yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.730" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">another human being and saying for good</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.420" end="00:21:02.280" style="s2">or bad I you know we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:03.990" style="s2">gonna work through this and not to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.280" end="00:21:07.740" style="s2">that there aren&#39;t some circumstances but</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.990" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">there is a level of uncovering of who</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.740" end="00:21:14.850" style="s2">you are that is necessary to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:16.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like a will a willingness to let go</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.850" end="00:21:18.030" style="s2">of your ideas of who you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.680" end="00:21:20.040" style="s2">be who they&#39;re supposed to be what a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.030" end="00:21:23.540" style="s2">marriage is supposed to look like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.040" end="00:21:26.940" style="s2">know my my marriage has done you know a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.540" end="00:21:28.260" style="s2">bazillion you know a complete 180 from</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.940" end="00:21:30.540" style="s2">where what I thought marriage was</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.260" end="00:21:32.460" style="s2">supposed to look like and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.540" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.460" end="00:21:38.610" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily willing to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:41.070" style="s2">their idea of who their partner is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.610" end="00:21:42.810" style="s2">supposed to be or who they are supposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.070" end="00:21:46.230" style="s2">to be or what marriage is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.810" end="00:21:48.180" style="s2">look like that you know I I&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.230" end="00:21:50.730" style="s2">the concept of open marriages and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.180" end="00:21:52.940" style="s2">polyamory and do your exploring but</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.730" end="00:21:56.430" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be said for like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.940" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">there being one person for to which you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.430" end="00:22:04.530" style="s2">are like you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re shackled</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:07.050" style="s2">with them you know you&#39;re shackled with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.530" end="00:22:10.710" style="s2">them and it being difficult and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.050" end="00:22:11.260" style="s2">difficult and painful to set to break</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.710" end="00:22:15.910" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.260" end="00:22:17.680" style="s2">to break that again I know I do get that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.910" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">and you need the commitment to hold you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.680" end="00:22:20.830" style="s2">together when it you should be staying</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.780" style="s2">together because it&#39;s hard for now but</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.830" end="00:22:26.200" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s worth yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.780" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">do I do understand that I just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.200" end="00:22:30.220" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:31.870" style="s2">no I you&#39;re going it&#39;s weird because</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.220" end="00:22:33.940" style="s2">part of it is the transparency of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.870" end="00:22:35.890" style="s2">marriage part of it is that it is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.940" end="00:22:37.450" style="s2">contract it&#39;s supposed to be forever and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.890" end="00:22:39.220" style="s2">that has somewhat outlived its</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.450" end="00:22:41.470" style="s2">usefulness completely like we don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.220" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">at work like that anymore right even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.470" end="00:22:43.990" style="s2">you think you&#39;re going to the university</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:46.060" style="s2">to have a career you&#39;re gonna be there</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.990" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">for 40 years we can see that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.060" end="00:22:49.720" style="s2">case and we don&#39;t you know I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:50.890" style="s2">don&#39;t look at you as broken because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.720" end="00:22:52.870" style="s2">want to you know go back to university</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.890" end="00:22:54.340" style="s2">and did something new and outgrew your</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.870" end="00:22:56.740" style="s2">you know profession or the profession</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.340" end="00:22:59.380" style="s2">changed and at the same time marriage is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.740" end="00:23:01.180" style="s2">like a business contract between two</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.380" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">people two families and then it became</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.180" end="00:23:04.990" style="s2">more about love and and now we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:07.690" style="s2">working through our stuff together and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.990" end="00:23:09.640" style="s2">so like the idea when you&#39;re young in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.690" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">the LA or whatever young love whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.640" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">you&#39;re Lera or not that we&#39;re gonna live</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:16.780" style="s2">together like forever you&#39;re my soul</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:18.070" style="s2">mate we&#39;re never is always naive always</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.780" end="00:23:20.950" style="s2">there&#39;s always gonna be conflict but</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.070" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">there&#39;s also like I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.950" end="00:23:25.060" style="s2">marriages needing to be renewed every</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:26.860" style="s2">five to 10 years like what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.060" end="00:23:28.690" style="s2">is committing to five years of being</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.860" end="00:23:30.370" style="s2">together and focusing right like and if</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.690" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">you break it beforehand it&#39;s broken but</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.370" end="00:23:34.150" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s like do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:36.340" style="s2">recommit now to the next five years the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.150" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">next five years and maybe kids takes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.340" end="00:23:40.180" style="s2">minimum ten-year commitment right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:42.430" style="s2">like all right there this old at that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.180" end="00:23:44.140" style="s2">point but um I mean I&#39;m not actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.430" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">advocating this but like the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.140" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">flipside of what is marriage in society</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2">and can we change that right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:54.310" style="s2">common law there&#39;s all these other</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:57.370" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t marriage marriage but</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.310" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">at the same time how much is society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.370" end="00:24:00.670" style="s2">version of what America should be what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">should then take on if I already took it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.670" end="00:24:03.220" style="s2">on right well we&#39;re together forever</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.900" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s what marriage is and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.220" end="00:24:05.050" style="s2">I&#39;m 20 years in and I&#39;m like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:07.210" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.050" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">this isn&#39;t what I like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.210" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">helping my growth this is stalling me</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">this is not the PERT you know like there</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:14.740" style="s2">does come apart a point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">painful to let someone go and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.740" end="00:24:17.290" style="s2">almost like you have to work through</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">that if it&#39;s not over abusive and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.290" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">don&#39;t mean like it&#39;s harming you more</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.520" end="00:24:24.040" style="s2">than you&#39;re there and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:25.150" style="s2">almost like this like the opposite is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.040" end="00:24:27.880" style="s2">lyric in a song</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.150" end="00:24:31.300" style="s2">the opposite of love is not hate its its</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.880" end="00:24:33.490" style="s2">indifference and if you get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.300" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">indifference in your marriage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.490" end="00:24:37.270" style="s2">kind of the point where it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.740" style="s2">it&#39;s time to not a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.270" end="00:24:40.450" style="s2">indifference but like this constant</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.740" end="00:24:42.309" style="s2">setting of indifference that like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.450" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not growing and it&#39;s time to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.309" end="00:24:46.300" style="s2">somewhat split up that to me is a more</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:47.860" style="s2">healthy split up than like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.300" end="00:24:50.200" style="s2">like divorce out of anger and hatred</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.860" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s clearly something there</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.200" end="00:24:53.830" style="s2">that needs to be worked through until</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:55.300" style="s2">you either get back to love or to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.830" end="00:24:57.420" style="s2">indifference you know and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.300" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">what&#39;s coming up it&#39;s not the truth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.420" end="00:25:04.900" style="s2">well and I think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.920" end="00:25:07.540" style="s2">I see and is just because of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.900" end="00:25:10.929" style="s2">experience a lot of what I see is women</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.540" end="00:25:13.510" style="s2">who and this is this is a complete</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.929" end="00:25:20.790" style="s2">generalization and it&#39;s not universally</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.510" end="00:25:24.070" style="s2">true but there&#39;s this idea that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.790" end="00:25:26.620" style="s2">because I discovered it in me I see it a</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.070" end="00:25:29.100" style="s2">lot in my comment in conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.620" end="00:25:34.780" style="s2">I have with other women which about</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.980" end="00:26:37.780" style="s2">are in fact just as narcissistic at if</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.220" end="00:26:39.850" style="s2">not more than</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.780" end="00:26:43.030" style="s2">the partner they&#39;re claiming is abusing</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.850" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">them I was thinking as you would talk</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.990" end="00:26:49.900" style="s2">of the whole not the concept of merit I</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.670" end="00:26:52.660" style="s2">could make an equally strong case for</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.900" end="00:26:54.250" style="s2">people don&#39;t people do give up on it too</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.660" end="00:26:56.290" style="s2">easily divorce has become too easy I I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.250" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">also agree with that weird isn&#39;t it how</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.290" end="00:27:01.320" style="s2">you can sit very much on both sides of</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.140" end="00:27:24.340" style="s2">and luckily I had somebody who was kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.310" end="00:27:25.720" style="s2">enough to point me to the meme that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.340" end="00:27:27.550" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing a finger at one person</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.720" end="00:27:29.920" style="s2">there&#39;s three fingers pointing back at</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.920" end="00:27:32.920" style="s2">you dislike most in others is probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.660" end="00:27:35.590" style="s2">something you won&#39;t acknowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.920" end="00:27:37.240" style="s2">yourself like those are lessons that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.590" end="00:27:38.800" style="s2">don&#39;t really want to acknowledge and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.240" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">would be much easier to just get away</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.800" end="00:27:44.020" style="s2">from the marriage then too but it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:45.310" style="s2">there but there&#39;s this but do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.020" end="00:27:47.860" style="s2">believe what going back to what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.310" end="00:27:49.510" style="s2">talked about is like there yeah for some</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.860" end="00:27:51.280" style="s2">marriages there you come a point you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.510" end="00:27:53.170" style="s2">know there comes a point at which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.280" end="00:28:08.590" style="s2">not that there&#39;s something that I have</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.590" end="00:28:13.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfect example of something</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.750" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">where sometimes it just becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.470" end="00:28:20.650" style="s2">evidence of like yeah we can we can part</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:24.400" style="s2">company in an amicable way and love each</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.650" end="00:28:28.600" style="s2">other and then in other cases it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.400" end="00:28:31.660" style="s2">know not you know it&#39;s I&#39;m trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.660" end="00:28:38.710" style="s2">example that I the perfect example I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.910" end="00:28:42.580" style="s2">see is like the the fought the dads who</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.710" end="00:28:45.100" style="s2">can like help their kids help their you</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.429" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">if you if you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.059" end="00:28:55.799" style="s2">then I think you&#39;re in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:58.620" style="s2">it&#39;s okay but if you&#39;re doing yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.799" end="00:29:03.179" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not quite following that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.620" end="00:29:04.679" style="s2">thoughtfully that is also actually with</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.179" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">some of my litmus test whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.679" end="00:29:08.700" style="s2">they&#39;re but they&#39;re a functioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:10.590" style="s2">co-parenting couple is like how they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.700" end="00:29:11.940" style="s2">function as a family unit even though</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.590" end="00:29:13.769" style="s2">they&#39;re not effect like a living</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.940" end="00:29:15.899" style="s2">together a family unit can you do things</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.769" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">together and some cannot like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.899" end="00:29:19.999" style="s2">just there&#39;s too much emotion and too</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.919" style="s2">much triggering there and then some are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.999" end="00:29:24.690" style="s2">like when my kids school close down the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.919" end="00:29:26.970" style="s2">end of last year in her school last year</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.690" end="00:29:28.830" style="s2">was kind of a co-parenting person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.970" end="00:29:30.990" style="s2">dream because there were so many</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.830" end="00:29:32.999" style="s2">campuses that one person could send them</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.990" end="00:29:35.159" style="s2">to school school bus and pick them up in</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.999" end="00:29:37.230" style="s2">a different location and scenery when</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.159" end="00:29:40.379" style="s2">you switched custody on Wednesdays no</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.230" end="00:29:41.999" style="s2">problem but there was both when a couple</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.379" end="00:29:43.230" style="s2">would break up the amount of times their</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.999" end="00:29:44.610" style="s2">kids were pulled out of this school</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.230" end="00:29:46.289" style="s2">because it was an alternative school</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.610" end="00:29:47.700" style="s2">right clearly one parent was on board</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.289" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">one parent wasn&#39;t on board of the school</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:51.899" style="s2">but when the school closed the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:53.850" style="s2">somewhat friction that happened between</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.899" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">co-parents of light weight now which</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.850" end="00:29:57.629" style="s2">school are they going to go to right my</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.340" style="s2">school or your school and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.629" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s like my life versus your</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.340" end="00:30:03.090" style="s2">life rather than what&#39;s best for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">school like what&#39;s the best school for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.090" end="00:30:06.509" style="s2">the kids right what&#39;s the best it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:07.710" style="s2">gonna be the most employment maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.509" end="00:30:10.679" style="s2">goes to one and one goes to the other I</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.710" end="00:30:13.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know like that this is my point if</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.679" end="00:30:14.580" style="s2">that was but like that they it used to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.289" end="00:30:17.399" style="s2">work and then it change and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.580" end="00:30:18.929" style="s2">okay are we in here for the kids or are</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.399" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">we in here for you know I mean for</p>

<p begin="00:30:40.710" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">go of and I think that the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.249" end="00:30:50.789" style="s2">marriage thing is a perfect example of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">being willing to let go of an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.789" end="00:30:57.570" style="s2">how something is supposed to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:30:59.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like my idea of who you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.570" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">supposed to be who I&#39;m supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.450" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">what what a marriage is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.500" end="00:31:10.230" style="s2">supposed to look like I think ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:12.360" style="s2">like in the United States I I firmly</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.230" end="00:31:16.110" style="s2">believe that what the United States is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.360" end="00:31:18.570" style="s2">going through is a we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.110" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">dysfunctional marriage like between the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.570" end="00:31:24.510" style="s2">two political parties like the and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:26.940" style="s2">having to have this come-to-jesus moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.510" end="00:31:29.310" style="s2">of like okay so are what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.940" end="00:31:31.470" style="s2">are we are we splitting up are we stick</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.470" end="00:31:35.670" style="s2">willing to stick through this and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.790" end="00:31:37.860" style="s2">deal with our and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.670" end="00:31:39.090" style="s2">you know the fact that fifty percent of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.860" end="00:31:41.430" style="s2">marriages ended in divorce</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.090" end="00:31:43.980" style="s2">people are don&#39;t aren&#39;t willing to stick</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.430" end="00:31:47.460" style="s2">through and like work through their</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.980" end="00:31:49.170" style="s2">stuff together so like of course it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.460" end="00:31:53.070" style="s2">would make sense of like no we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.170" end="00:31:57.960" style="s2">gonna we just ignore you and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.070" end="00:32:00.210" style="s2">try and pretend you don&#39;t exist yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.960" end="00:32:03.770" style="s2">letting go of what things are what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.210" end="00:32:06.930" style="s2">think things are supposed to look like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.770" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">but that&#39;s a scary thing to do because</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.930" end="00:32:14.910" style="s2">then you&#39;re in this like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:16.470" style="s2">everything I thought is wrong well you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.910" end="00:32:23.220" style="s2">know you don&#39;t do it all at once right I</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.470" end="00:32:26.370" style="s2">mean that would be that would be scary I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.220" end="00:32:29.430" style="s2">get that from being a parent like having</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.370" end="00:32:31.530" style="s2">becoming a parent having like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.430" end="00:32:33.240" style="s2">entity that you think you can mold and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.530" end="00:32:35.940" style="s2">shape right and there&#39;s a way parenting</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.240" end="00:32:38.400" style="s2">is gonna go wait this is gonna go and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.940" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">all it ever does is fall apart like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.400" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">one thing you know is it&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.750" end="00:32:41.910" style="s2">according to plan</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.470" end="00:32:44.790" style="s2">starting with the birthing or adoption</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.910" end="00:32:47.970" style="s2">plan it&#39;s never gonna happen and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.790" end="00:32:50.400" style="s2">welcome to Parenthood and that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">literally something you could form right</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.400" end="00:32:55.530" style="s2">like a child is as much a blank canvas</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:08.970" style="s2">she&#39;s a mini but like this whole I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.350" end="00:33:10.740" style="s2">an expectations of how it would go and</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.400" end="00:33:14.790" style="s2">where is when I can be like what&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.170" end="00:33:17.070" style="s2">what&#39;s present what&#39;s beautiful what</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.790" end="00:33:18.210" style="s2">works here and it doesn&#39;t like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.070" end="00:33:19.980" style="s2">no way I&#39;m giving her</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.210" end="00:33:22.590" style="s2">later or anything like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.180" style="s2">divorce for my kid no matter what unless</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.180" end="00:33:29.730" style="s2">thank God because I would not have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.410" end="00:33:32.670" style="s2">capable of being in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.730" end="00:33:34.440" style="s2">relationship like this I might be now</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.670" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">but before she was born before I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.440" end="00:33:40.290" style="s2">this experience there&#39;s no way I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:41.460" style="s2">have been and that&#39;s not don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.290" end="00:33:43.410" style="s2">kid and then get married</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:44.670" style="s2">what was that her there are places where</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.410" end="00:33:46.200" style="s2">marriages are like that where there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.670" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">literally no at least not for the woman</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.200" end="00:33:49.530" style="s2">maybe for the man but not for the woman</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:50.970" style="s2">you know there are there are plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.530" end="00:33:53.820" style="s2">places where there is there&#39;s no you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.970" end="00:33:55.410" style="s2">know the marriages as as much of a total</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.820" end="00:33:57.000" style="s2">commitment as the child is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.410" end="00:33:59.550" style="s2">interesting isn&#39;t it he&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.000" end="00:34:01.800" style="s2">point sort of goes as an unquestioned</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.550" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">thing but there is no divorcing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.800" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">from your children not a choice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.460" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">on the table I mean however difficult it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:19.640" style="s2">may be to divorce a spouse it is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:19.640" style="s2">option on the table whereas well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.870" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">that&#39;s you know so it is there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:30.300" style="s2">it is this is just a bit what seems a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">bit more extreme with children but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.300" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">you&#39;re right it is that and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:39.180" style="s2">like that&#39;s the weird having a child and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:40.920" style="s2">placing them for adoption is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.180" end="00:34:42.690" style="s2">most loving selfless acts I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.920" end="00:34:44.160" style="s2">imagine going through pregnancy and not</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.690" end="00:34:46.250" style="s2">have you know like there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.160" end="00:34:48.570" style="s2">comes up with that and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.250" end="00:34:50.700" style="s2">because your option to give that child</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.570" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">away truly is it conception and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.700" end="00:34:54.120" style="s2">therefore no I don&#39;t even know what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:56.040" style="s2">look like what they exist like anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.120" end="00:34:57.900" style="s2">and so like having the child and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.040" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">place it with a family that you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.900" end="00:35:01.860" style="s2">can better better care for them to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:04.230" style="s2">it&#39;s nowhere near the same as like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.860" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">having a like I think the wound as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.230" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">child is different being a seven eight</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.930" style="s2">year old your parents can&#39;t take care of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">no matter how awesome you are there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.930" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">awesomeness enough to like for them to</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:14.490" style="s2">get over their addiction for them to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:16.860" style="s2">over the neglect and that parent is your</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.490" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">parent versus you know maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.860" end="00:35:20.430" style="s2">placed for adoption when you&#39;re a child</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.780" end="00:35:23.120" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have some kind of wounds</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.430" end="00:35:27.030" style="s2">possibly but not in the same way as like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.120" end="00:35:28.740" style="s2">like my kid can do absolutely anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.030" end="00:35:30.510" style="s2">I&#39;m never gonna divorce her she can</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.740" end="00:35:31.589" style="s2">murder she can do literally anything I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.510" end="00:35:33.509" style="s2">will visit her in prison</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.589" end="00:35:36.119" style="s2">right like she&#39;s my I love her no matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.509" end="00:35:37.619" style="s2">who she is and what she does I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.119" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">that for any other human being on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.619" end="00:35:41.699" style="s2">planet as someone who recently kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:43.650" style="s2">sort of I&#39;m ready to get back but did</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.699" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">disown my sister a year ago I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.650" end="00:35:48.689" style="s2">think that would possible a week two</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">weeks before it happened but she was</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.689" end="00:35:52.469" style="s2">family family&#39;s family and how much</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:55.019" style="s2">family for me had to fall apart in order</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.469" end="00:35:58.439" style="s2">for me to actually like find it in other</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.019" end="00:36:02.009" style="s2">places and find what it is yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.439" end="00:36:06.209" style="s2">that being willing to let go of like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.009" end="00:36:11.180" style="s2">idea of what family looks like what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.209" end="00:36:13.170" style="s2">anything looks like in you know in life</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.180" end="00:36:16.019" style="s2">expectations you&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.170" end="00:36:17.729" style="s2">just expect at least expectations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.019" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">others yeah even if not for yourself at</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.729" end="00:36:24.089" style="s2">expectations others yeah okay you not</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:27.410" style="s2">live up to my expectations one of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.089" end="00:36:30.089" style="s2">favorite phrases is the you know is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.410" end="00:36:35.009" style="s2">expectations or premeditated resentments</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.089" end="00:36:41.029" style="s2">oh that&#39;s great I love that I like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.009" end="00:36:43.559" style="s2">one and but at the same time there is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.029" end="00:36:46.319" style="s2">bringing in Jordan Peterson I remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.559" end="00:36:48.749" style="s2">that there was one you know something</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.319" end="00:36:50.729" style="s2">that he talked about of like but if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.749" end="00:36:52.499" style="s2">don&#39;t have expectations of other you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.729" end="00:37:00.269" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you know there&#39;s letting</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.499" end="00:37:04.679" style="s2">go of expectations and yet the concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.269" end="00:37:10.979" style="s2">of a gothic love is the idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.679" end="00:37:13.049" style="s2">can&#39;t be coming as well is the I hold a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.979" end="00:37:18.150" style="s2">vision of what is possible for you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.049" end="00:37:20.130" style="s2">so like there&#39;s it&#39;s not exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.150" end="00:37:21.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I have a particular clear</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.130" end="00:37:23.249" style="s2">vision of what is possible for you but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.539" end="00:37:25.529" style="s2">know that you will become more than you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.249" end="00:37:26.939" style="s2">currently are so you love you and I also</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.529" end="00:37:28.799" style="s2">love everything that you will be in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.939" end="00:37:30.179" style="s2">future yeah I&#39;d not looking that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.799" end="00:37:32.939" style="s2">in a state in a perpetual state of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.179" end="00:37:34.949" style="s2">growth kind of thing right and but there</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.939" end="00:37:37.739" style="s2">I remember Jordan Peterson talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.949" end="00:37:40.439" style="s2">you know that that disappointment that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.739" end="00:37:43.949" style="s2">you have or the feeling that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.439" end="00:37:44.810" style="s2">when someone that you love is not being</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.949" end="00:37:48.110" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.810" end="00:37:49.700" style="s2">who you know they could be and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.110" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">like whole you know so it&#39;s like letting</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.700" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">go of the expectation but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:57.140" style="s2">time holding the vision of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:59.630" style="s2">if we don&#39;t if we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.140" end="00:38:02.990" style="s2">expectations of each other then you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.630" end="00:38:05.180" style="s2">they&#39;re it&#39;s like Manassas we we hold</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.990" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">each other you know it&#39;s like we hold</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.180" end="00:38:09.170" style="s2">each other up we you know yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.080" style="s2">want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.170" end="00:38:16.820" style="s2">hahaha but we want to do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.080" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">consensual way it&#39;s a tricky one isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.820" end="00:38:20.750" style="s2">it because any any any goal or</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:22.820" style="s2">expectation immediately becomes a judge</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.750" end="00:38:25.940" style="s2">as well right so it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.820" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">really yeah it&#39;s a well and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.940" end="00:38:30.770" style="s2">Hennigan I like I like bringing in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:33.170" style="s2">concept of the consent with it because</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.770" end="00:38:37.480" style="s2">like I&#39;m part of I just started being</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.170" end="00:38:41.120" style="s2">part of a mastermind birth and I am I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.480" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">have basically asked them please expect</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.120" end="00:38:49.580" style="s2">me to do this because in making that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:53.360" style="s2">commitment like I am I&#39;m saying I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.580" end="00:38:56.120" style="s2">to be held accountable for not not meant</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.360" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">not meeting my expectation to this group</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.120" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">which is a commitment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:01.190" style="s2">ultimately a commitment to myself but a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:04.820" style="s2">commitment to the group of doing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.190" end="00:39:07.340" style="s2">thing every day and so but there&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.820" end="00:39:10.580" style="s2">what happens when you have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.340" end="00:39:15.140" style="s2">expectation that is a an agreement you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.580" end="00:39:17.450" style="s2">know there&#39;s a one sided agreement which</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.140" end="00:39:19.370" style="s2">is I think one expectation basically is</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.450" end="00:39:21.620" style="s2">yeah right because I&#39;m expecting you to</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.370" end="00:39:22.970" style="s2">know what my expectation is and live up</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.620" end="00:39:25.220" style="s2">to it without me even necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.970" end="00:39:27.560" style="s2">able to verbalize it and put it in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.220" end="00:39:29.900" style="s2">conscious and so when you fail I&#39;m gonna</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.079" end="00:43:17.699" style="s2">contract like having the monogamy vessel</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.109" end="00:43:31.619" style="s2">conflict but a lot of it swept under the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.239" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">rug because you&#39;re not dealing with all</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.619" end="00:43:36.359" style="s2">the couples I know that are probably a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:38.279" style="s2">Marez truly polyamorous have had to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.359" end="00:43:40.019" style="s2">better communication and a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.279" end="00:43:41.999" style="s2">relationship than the monogamous ones I</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:56.099" style="s2">talked about even if it&#39;s not putting it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.789" end="00:43:59.549" style="s2">on someone else and I love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.099" end="00:44:01.199" style="s2">the explicitness and how it&#39;s not in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.549" end="00:44:02.849" style="s2">lot of marriages would fix that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.199" end="00:44:03.630" style="s2">that&#39;s between two people imagine all</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.849" end="00:44:05.640" style="s2">the unex</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.630" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">in it whatever the opposite of explicit</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.640" end="00:44:09.689" style="s2">is for everything in society like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.339" style="s2">shopping cart and this is what I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.689" end="00:44:12.989" style="s2">talking about was like if we truly</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.339" end="00:44:14.729" style="s2">wanted to maximize society so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.989" end="00:44:17.640" style="s2">put their shopping cart back then okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.729" end="00:44:19.259" style="s2">but we have millions of these tasks all</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.640" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">of which are varying degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.259" end="00:44:21.960" style="s2">importance to various one to other</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:24.059" style="s2">people right</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:25.650" style="s2">so it&#39;s like well how do I know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.059" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">level this is that society hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.650" end="00:44:29.670" style="s2">decided it&#39;s all just not explicit at</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.380" end="00:44:31.170" style="s2">all you&#39;re supposed to follow all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.670" end="00:44:33.869" style="s2">these rules and all of these unwritten</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.170" end="00:44:35.339" style="s2">ones in social interactions again you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.869" end="00:44:37.710" style="s2">know hygiene and health care like</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.339" end="00:44:39.809" style="s2">everything and it&#39;s like okay which one</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.710" end="00:44:41.970" style="s2">do you want me to match yeah because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.809" end="00:44:43.410" style="s2">can&#39;t maximize all of them and so again</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.970" end="00:44:45.089" style="s2">if you want me to focus on the shopping</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.410" end="00:44:47.490" style="s2">cart I will focus on the shopping cart</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.089" end="00:44:49.380" style="s2">but I can&#39;t do it all until finding that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.490" end="00:44:50.970" style="s2">one thing that like you okay I can fix</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.380" end="00:44:52.950" style="s2">this for you but if everyone want this</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.970" end="00:44:54.569" style="s2">one person wants me to fix shopping cart</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.950" end="00:44:57.450" style="s2">one person wants me to fix this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.569" end="00:44:59.849" style="s2">like no no I need one thing to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.450" end="00:45:05.940" style="s2">one thing to focus on to make better and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.849" end="00:45:11.069" style="s2">then yeah see I had some here as they</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.940" end="00:45:13.950" style="s2">say an order slightly strayed from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.069" end="00:45:16.109" style="s2">actual question that where it seems a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:19.890" style="s2">little bit I was straight from that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.109" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it it it&#39;s ultimately like</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.460" end="00:46:48.860" style="s2">of and the thing that you know a word</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.300" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">that just popped into my head as far as</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.860" end="00:46:52.340" style="s2">that the shopping cart thing is you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:54.470" style="s2">one of the things that our current</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.340" end="00:46:57.650" style="s2">called our current society has optimized</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.470" end="00:47:00.890" style="s2">for is efficiency and so sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.650" end="00:47:04.010" style="s2">most efficient thing that I can do is to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.890" end="00:47:06.290" style="s2">push my cart like up onto you know so</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.010" end="00:47:07.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to like you know I&#39;ll at</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.290" end="00:47:10.100" style="s2">least some you know there if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.850" end="00:47:11.630" style="s2">gonna return the cart I will push it so</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.100" end="00:47:14.860" style="s2">to into a place so it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.630" end="00:47:19.580" style="s2">roll into somebody&#39;s car like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.860" end="00:47:22.340" style="s2">but I you know because that sometimes is</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.580" end="00:47:24.890" style="s2">the most efficient you know way cuz</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.340" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">maybe like it&#39;s it&#39;s a day where I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.890" end="00:47:28.490" style="s2">couldn&#39;t you know I tent I because of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:29.060" style="s2">this I&#39;ve been thinking about like what</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.490" end="00:47:31.880" style="s2">do I do</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.060" end="00:47:35.060" style="s2">I tend to park near like I try to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.880" end="00:47:36.830" style="s2">aware of where are the cart stalls so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.060" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">that I can ear it so I don&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.830" end="00:47:41.170" style="s2">out of my way but if I can&#39;t park near</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:46.010" style="s2">one I will sometimes just push it to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.170" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">someplace you know close by because more</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.010" end="00:47:50.300" style="s2">efficient I was not aware when this</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:52.340" style="s2">whole thing started that America does</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.300" end="00:47:53.600" style="s2">not have a deposit on carts because that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.340" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">was part of it I was like what about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.600" end="00:47:57.170" style="s2">deposit like that&#39;s very different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:57.830" style="s2">a different motivation I want to get my</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.170" end="00:48:00.080" style="s2">dollar back</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.830" end="00:48:01.730" style="s2">versus every time you get a cart they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.080" end="00:48:04.370" style="s2">connected you put in a quarter a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.730" end="00:48:05.870" style="s2">and it gives you a cart and so you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.370" end="00:48:07.130" style="s2">and take it back you get your dollar a</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.870" end="00:48:09.500" style="s2">quarterback and it&#39;s enough of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.130" end="00:48:11.840" style="s2">incentive that people do it there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.500" end="00:48:14.570" style="s2">odd shopping cart in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.840" end="00:48:15.890" style="s2">parking lot but very rarely except it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.570" end="00:48:17.150" style="s2">costs over they don&#39;t have the deposit</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.890" end="00:48:19.070" style="s2">and then they&#39;re everywhere but but</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.150" end="00:48:21.050" style="s2">staff nicely together right you find a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.070" end="00:48:23.780" style="s2">mate for yours and put it with it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.050" end="00:48:25.790" style="s2">I&#39;m like then why don&#39;t its money</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.780" end="00:48:28.010" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry money to put these things on</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.050" end="00:48:45.220" style="s2">short-circuiting at the idea like I got</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.850" end="00:48:46.840" style="s2">never an assignment</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.220" end="00:48:49.650" style="s2">the idea you don&#39;t have it I&#39;m like but</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.840" end="00:48:52.210" style="s2">why like I was told in nineteen shopping</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.210" end="00:48:59.290" style="s2">which is nothing you just spent on</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.619" end="00:49:00.970" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s enough it&#39;s money right</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.290" end="00:49:02.440" style="s2">it&#39;s enough to get people to totaling</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.970" end="00:49:06.070" style="s2">back with their cart to get their pound</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.440" end="00:49:07.840" style="s2">back if he gonna turn my car because he</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.070" end="00:49:20.369" style="s2">wanted the pounds and I was like I like</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.369" end="00:49:24.340" style="s2">I mean that needs to be when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:25.869" style="s2">all bottles and cans had deposits on</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.340" end="00:49:30.340" style="s2">them and kids would spend their weekends</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.869" end="00:49:34.930" style="s2">going around the park to get a few quid</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.340" end="00:49:36.730" style="s2">it&#39;s great I don&#39;t get why we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.930" end="00:49:39.099" style="s2">doing these really obvious simple things</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.730" end="00:49:41.980" style="s2">that work and there are people we still</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.099" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">do that in terms of the cans and but</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.980" end="00:49:47.800" style="s2">there are people who like who do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.869" style="s2">professionally now like you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.800" end="00:49:54.190" style="s2">doing that because there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.869" end="00:49:55.930" style="s2">are doing it professionally yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.190" end="00:49:58.210" style="s2">here too there&#39;s actually almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.930" end="00:49:59.890" style="s2">union like don&#39;t collect bottles in</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.210" end="00:50:03.550" style="s2">their alleys that aren&#39;t yours you will</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.890" end="00:50:05.170" style="s2">get in trouble home right yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.550" end="00:50:07.089" style="s2">somewhere as I put my note nicely the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.170" end="00:50:10.270" style="s2">mothers there&#39;s Avalon milk bottles that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.089" end="00:50:11.470" style="s2">are a dollar 25 deposit those I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.270" end="00:50:14.020" style="s2">put out in the alley except when I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.020" end="00:50:16.839" style="s2">rinse out and bring back because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.190" end="00:50:19.869" style="s2">enough of a barrier right and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.839" end="00:50:22.150" style="s2">question with economics with these</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.869" end="00:50:23.589" style="s2">deposits like changing the incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.150" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">that&#39;s like well that&#39;s it and then it</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:27.700" style="s2">of are you a good human being because</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.560" end="00:50:29.890" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is are you willing to</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.530" end="00:50:40.920" style="s2">deposit where because of that I will</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.530" end="00:50:45.099" style="s2">leave it by my car and so on you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.920" end="00:50:50.380" style="s2">now granted like so we have like we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.180" end="00:51:12.220" style="s2">another one or whatever and then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:14.770" style="s2">Costco employees will come and collect</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.220" end="00:51:17.859" style="s2">all those cards because the parking lots</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.680" end="00:53:00.670" style="s2">is if 95 percent of people put the cards</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:02.650" style="s2">back who cares about the 5 percent if</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.670" end="00:53:05.050" style="s2">we&#39;re all the five percent various</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.650" end="00:53:06.790" style="s2">places but we&#39;re all getting mad at each</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.050" end="00:53:08.440" style="s2">other for the 5 percent to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.790" end="00:53:10.210" style="s2">even you know they mean like because we</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.440" end="00:53:10.750" style="s2">haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t explicitly stated</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.210" end="00:53:14.650" style="s2">what&#39;s import</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.750" end="00:53:16.330" style="s2">and what&#39;s not important yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.650" end="00:53:17.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this necessary applies to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">shopping carts but the argument would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.890" end="00:53:23.530" style="s2">that yeah it&#39;s only 5% not doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:25.120" style="s2">if it&#39;s easier to not do it than to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.530" end="00:53:26.980" style="s2">it and there&#39;s no consequences for not</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.120" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">doing it and people see people doing it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.980" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">not doing it and getting away with it</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:31.600" style="s2">then more and more people will start not</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:33.910" style="s2">doing it is the argument I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.600" end="00:53:39.100" style="s2">necessarily saying it holds up but that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.910" end="00:53:41.770" style="s2">would be the argument well what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.100" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">saying like I think it brings it back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.770" end="00:53:49.570" style="s2">like what are what are our assumed</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:51.340" style="s2">agreements that we it&#39;s like what what</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.570" end="00:53:54.670" style="s2">are what are the things that we assume</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.340" end="00:53:56.830" style="s2">that everyone else is doing that or that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.670" end="00:54:00.030" style="s2">everyone else thinks the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.830" end="00:54:03.130" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually a very easy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.030" end="00:54:05.140" style="s2">find out because it&#39;s ton of like a fish</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.130" end="00:54:07.960" style="s2">in water it&#39;s like well that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.140" end="00:54:09.250" style="s2">way you know like you grow up in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.960" end="00:54:10.360" style="s2">particular environment it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.250" end="00:54:12.700" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way people look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.360" end="00:54:16.870" style="s2">things not realizing that not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.700" end="00:54:17.800" style="s2">looks at things in that same way and my</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.870" end="00:54:19.480" style="s2">husband and I have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.800" end="00:54:23.260" style="s2">encountering that one recently because</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.480" end="00:54:25.780" style="s2">of some implicit assumptions that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.260" end="00:54:27.700" style="s2">each have we&#39;ve been having an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.780" end="00:54:31.720" style="s2">discussion about the Second Amendment</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.700" end="00:54:33.340" style="s2">because he&#39;s a strong he has a he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.720" end="00:54:36.030" style="s2">strong advocate for the Second Amendment</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.340" end="00:54:40.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not strong strongly opposed to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.030" end="00:54:43.810" style="s2">but I have my things of like I love your</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.360" end="00:54:48.850" style="s2">mommy which one the second firearms</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.810" end="00:54:52.990" style="s2">right okay but like there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.850" end="00:54:56.800" style="s2">these and you know we&#39;re getting down</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.990" end="00:55:00.730" style="s2">into some nitty-gritty like views about</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.800" end="00:55:03.010" style="s2">how we view each other it&#39;s like I have</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.730" end="00:55:05.740" style="s2">a particular model about the military</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.010" end="00:55:09.640" style="s2">and people in the military in my head</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.740" end="00:55:13.230" style="s2">and the fact that I have that model in</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.640" end="00:55:16.090" style="s2">my head is kind of horrifying to him and</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.230" end="00:55:19.390" style="s2">so like we&#39;re trying to where as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.090" end="00:55:21.310" style="s2">trying to navigate how do you like you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.390" end="00:55:23.140" style="s2">know there there&#39;s an input there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.310" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">said I keep wanting to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.140" end="00:55:28.210" style="s2">implicit but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:30.220" style="s2">the right word but there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.210" end="00:55:31.810" style="s2">there&#39;s an agreement you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.220" end="00:55:33.460" style="s2">has that you everyone looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.810" end="00:55:35.290" style="s2">military in this way and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.460" end="00:55:38.950" style="s2">like that there&#39;s a moral like it</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.290" end="00:55:42.610" style="s2">triggers a moral response and so like</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.950" end="00:55:44.830" style="s2">which you know and like that&#39;s the model</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.610" end="00:55:46.510" style="s2">I have in my head and I have you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.830" end="00:55:48.190" style="s2">and I there are other things where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.510" end="00:55:49.930" style="s2">know he has a model in his head and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.190" end="00:55:51.790" style="s2">like how could you possibly hold that</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.930" end="00:55:55.030" style="s2">model in your head mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.790" end="00:55:56.620" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s this idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.030" end="00:55:58.600" style="s2">supposed that that everyone&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.620" end="00:56:00.610" style="s2">to have this particular model and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.600" end="00:56:03.970" style="s2">don&#39;t realize oh wait a minute not</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.610" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">everyone has that concept in their head</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.970" end="00:56:11.110" style="s2">and like how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:13.450" style="s2">understand make an implicit agreement</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.110" end="00:56:19.120" style="s2">more explicit now I have to look up the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.450" end="00:56:20.800" style="s2">word implicit sorry the Second Amendment</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.120" end="00:56:22.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t apply to the military though</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.800" end="00:56:24.970" style="s2">does it I mean the second moment is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.150" end="00:56:28.810" style="s2">about the citizenry having a right to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.970" end="00:56:30.460" style="s2">our military really is it as I</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.810" end="00:56:32.620" style="s2">understand it anyway it&#39;s about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.460" end="00:56:34.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about retaining the right to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.620" end="00:56:35.830" style="s2">overthrow the government by by bearing</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.360" end="00:56:37.960" style="s2">arms right that&#39;s that&#39;s the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.830" end="00:56:43.210" style="s2">it as I understand it that&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.960" end="00:56:44.520" style="s2">of it and my it&#39;s not that I&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.210" end="00:56:47.050" style="s2">the Second Amendment I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.520" end="00:56:49.060" style="s2">understand it because the Second</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.050" end="00:56:50.890" style="s2">Amendment was written when the only</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.060" end="00:56:53.110" style="s2">thing that you you know it was written</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.890" end="00:56:54.490" style="s2">the the right to bear arms and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.110" end="00:56:56.170" style="s2">there reached a point at which the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.490" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">middle you know the the government the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.170" end="00:57:10.030" style="s2">military had no sense of it and so my</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:13.570" style="s2">the thinking in my head is like at that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.030" end="00:57:15.460" style="s2">point why does it matter and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.570" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">we&#39;re yeah I&#39;m getting definitely</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.460" end="00:57:19.060" style="s2">getting an education about why you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:20.980" style="s2">you know why for some people it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.060" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">matter and trying to like reconcile that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.980" end="00:57:28.420" style="s2">with my views of the world and so but</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:31.690" style="s2">yeah like how you know and going back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.420" end="00:57:36.280" style="s2">the marriage thing we have a reason to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.690" end="00:57:38.460" style="s2">not like say well screw you and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.280" end="00:57:41.130" style="s2">I&#39;m out of here like there&#39;s a commune</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.460" end="00:57:46.080" style="s2">there is a commitment between us and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.130" end="00:57:48.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason to sort of like on what</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.080" end="00:57:50.220" style="s2">you know for me a desire to want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.210" end="00:57:52.890" style="s2">understand his perspective because there</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.220" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">is a commitment there is a reason to</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.890" end="00:57:58.339" style="s2">want to understand you know the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:58:01.380" style="s2">difference between how we think and if</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.940" end="00:59:08.130" style="s2">game be like because how can you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.630" end="00:59:11.339" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re making those things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.130" end="00:59:15.390" style="s2">were implicit and just so implicit</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.339" end="00:59:17.250" style="s2">implied but not plainly expressed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.390" end="00:59:19.470" style="s2">the definition of that and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.250" end="00:59:21.060" style="s2">like yeah explicitly is implicit we want</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.470" end="00:59:22.470" style="s2">implicit become explicit because some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.060" end="00:59:24.690" style="s2">us don&#39;t get implicit we have very</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.470" end="00:59:26.400" style="s2">different implicit ideas yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.690" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">what was we&#39;re at the very ends of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.400" end="00:59:31.619" style="s2">hours do closing thoughts but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:33.330" style="s2">things as it came up for me we were talk</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.619" end="00:59:37.320" style="s2">about your husband and you was that like</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.330" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird underlining energy of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.320" end="00:59:40.859" style="s2">like you have to be willing to let</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:42.030" style="s2">something go to keep it like you don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.859" end="00:59:43.530" style="s2">mean you&#39;re married you&#39;re you&#39;re tied</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.030" end="00:59:45.300" style="s2">together and at the same time being able</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.530" end="00:59:46.500" style="s2">to freely say I don&#39;t know if I can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.300" end="00:59:48.630" style="s2">married to you if you feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.500" end="00:59:50.599" style="s2">about guns right like there are some</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.630" end="00:59:52.279" style="s2">marriages you can&#39;t say that in right</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.599" end="00:59:54.200" style="s2">even implying there&#39;s a possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.279" end="00:59:55.880" style="s2">divorce as grounds for divorce basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.200" end="00:59:57.470" style="s2">and then there&#39;s other where like listen</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.880" end="00:59:59.569" style="s2">I need to be able to say these things I</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.470" end="01:00:01.369" style="s2">need to be able to say this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.569" end="01:00:03.349" style="s2">deal-breaker even though it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.369" end="01:00:05.239" style="s2">right like I probably not actually get</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.349" end="01:00:07.729" style="s2">married I&#39;m divorced over this and at</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.239" end="01:00:10.249" style="s2">the same time like I need this to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.729" end="01:00:12.319" style="s2">processed it&#39;s like big emotion and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.249" end="01:00:13.970" style="s2">and whereas pushing it down breaks</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.319" end="01:00:16.630" style="s2">everything but it&#39;s like the polite</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.970" end="01:00:16.630" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.269" end="01:00:20.569" style="s2">I have a better sense of like if he</p>

<p begin="01:01:15.279" end="01:01:20.599" style="s2">you know and I guess ultimately it comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.049" end="01:01:24.469" style="s2">down to am I ready to let go of my</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.599" end="01:01:29.749" style="s2">implicit assumptions about yeah am I</p>
