<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">so maybe we could start with a little</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">i would like to know how you got</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">interested in iq research or</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">so let&#39;s start with that and then we can</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">dating diving into the nitty-gritty well</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">it started in graduate school um</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">at hopkins when i really</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:57.040" style="s2">became most interested in personality</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.040" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">and i started out studying individual</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">but just by happenstance the year i</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">started graduate school in 1971 was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">one of the professors there julian</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">was starting study of mathematically</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">and i was one of the proctors at the</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">talent search for mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">precocious kids</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">and i wrote my first couple of papers as</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">book chapters in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">in books that stanley uh was editing</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">and i saw these these kids aged 10 11 12</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">who were scoring higher on sat math</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">and the question was you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">this happen where does this come from so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">that was kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">earliest interest and in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">although i really completed my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">dissertation on</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">personality i</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">took my first job at the national</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">institute of mental health</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:09.879" style="s2">in the intramural research program in</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.879" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">psychopathology which at the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">the lab director was david rosenthal who</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">just finished the denmark adoption</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">studies of schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">right right and here is where i learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">genetics my office was next door</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">to a fella named monty buxbaum who was</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">doing both potential research</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">very interested in that and so my</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">my early interest in in individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">slowly morphed into an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">individual differences in intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">and at nimh they were just going through</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">a transition</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">from kind of a psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">orientation to a neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">orientation and i was kind of caught up</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the origin of my interest</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">and in technologies to make brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">measurements and relate that to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">differences okay right okay now you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">wrote a book too in the neuroscience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">campaign university press and so when</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">did that come out</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">that came out um really just about six</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">months ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">so it came out i think in december of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">2016 but they tell me for</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">publishing reasons they call it a 2017</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">publication</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">i see well part of the reason i was so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">excited to talk to you is that i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">a very large</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">amount of research especially not so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">practical lab research but investigation</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">into the structure of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">into its measurement we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">we designed back in 93 with a student of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">mine daniel higgins we designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">i think what was probably the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">battery purporting to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">cognitive abilities associated with</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">hypothetically the highest order</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">cognitive functions in the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">we found much to our chagrin i would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">and this was a very painful discovery</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:18.039" style="s2">a lot of what we had been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">as potentially separable</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.039" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">neuropsychological functions were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">easily collapsible and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">collapsible into good old general</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">intelligence you know that killer</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">central factor that seems to unite</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">cognitive abilities and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">it was quite a shock especially because</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">the neuropsychologists of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">they still do this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">uh are aren&#39;t as um</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">assiduous in investigators of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">psychometric intelligence literature as</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">they should be and tend to underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">the central power of that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">that initial factor so anyways i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">intelligence research partly from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">practical perspective too because the</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">literature is crystal clear for</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">complex jobs the best predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">long-term success is intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">a predictor that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">imagine you give it an r of 0.4 to 0.5</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">which is pretty decent so let&#39;s say 25</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">percent of the variance the next best</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">predictor is conscientiousness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">pushing its limit at mopping up 10 of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">the variability in long-term performance</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">so iq it&#39;s a killer man and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">we i make sure my students assess</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">intelligence with everything they do and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">it always</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">ends up being a major predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">things that you wouldn&#39;t even expect</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">like disgust sensitivity for example so</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">you disgust sensitivity is higher if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">have a lower iq</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">yeah the g factor is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">you just said something though that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">want to just make a distinction about</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the g factor and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">kind of called it iq this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">very common in everyday language to talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">about intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">iq and what we call the g factor</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">as one thing and it really isn&#39;t so an</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">iq score is a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">estimate of the g factor right it also</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">includes</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">other aspects of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">itself although it&#39;s a broad term</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">is only a part of the universe of mental</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">abilities</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">so if you&#39;re very good at say</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:25.240" style="s2">calculating</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">on what day january 5th was in the year</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.240" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">1520</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a mental ability that some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">have doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">right yes you see that with autistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">savants often that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">sent out often but sufficiently often</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">they have these amazing calculus like</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">calculation abilities for example that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to be manifest in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">spectacularly high</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">overall intelligence well so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">what do you want to tell us about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">want to start with the book</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">and and walk us through it well you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">book is kind of a culmination</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">of things i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">mostly from my neural imaging work on</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">and it kind of came as a surprise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">the first book i&#39;ve ever written i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">now retired actually from academia never</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">wrote a book while i was in academia i</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">was writing you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">journal papers uh but cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">university press called and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">have this series of fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">and they wanted to include intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">and i regarded that as a major step</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">because intelligence research really has</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">been relegated almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">to uh the peripheral of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">yeah yeah politically suspect to say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">yeah and you know the the switch</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">happened overnight</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">from may being in the mainstream to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">being really peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">in about 1969 before 1969</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">almost everyone who was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">was concerned about the achievement gaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">and they felt universally</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">that once you equalized educational</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">those achievement gaps would disappear</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">very fast yeah that was the head start</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">the head start yeah even before head</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">head start it came to head start</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">but even before head start there were</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">all these demonstration projects there</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">was one</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">the miracle in milwaukee and there were</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">all these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">that showed that if you you really</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:44.440" style="s2">intervened in early childhood education</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">yeah which at that time was called</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.440" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">compensatory education</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">the early childhood education term</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">came much later but this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">compensatory education</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">really took off and then in 1969 the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">harvard educational review</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">asked one of the foremost educational</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">psychologists arthur jensen</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">to write a review of the progress and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">article in 1969 has become infamous the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">opening sentence was</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">essentially we&#39;ve tried compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">and it has failed yeah and then he had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">hundred pages of detailed statistical</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">of why there were no inc you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">demonstrate an increase in iq score</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">in any of these programs now head start</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">had just begun so head start</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t included yeah but i you know i</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">reviewed the literature on head start</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">too extensively and basically what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">happened was that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">so that was for those of the viewers who</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know head start was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">nationwide attempt to to add additional</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">education to the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">dis disadvantaged kids especially you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">at the preschool level and basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">what happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">was that they actually did show</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">improvements in academic achievement</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">initially</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">so in grade one and grade two they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">performing above their peers but then</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">difference in improvement the difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">in performance started to decrease and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">then by</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">about the grade grade five or grade six</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">the differences had disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">so there was no evidence whatsoever of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">that of that either of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">stable one-time long-term gain in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">cognitive ability</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">or what people were really hoping was</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">that if you intervened early enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">you&#39;d get something that would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">would turn into a positive feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">and the gains would actually advance</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">across time and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">what ended up happening with the head</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">start research basically was</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">the conclusion that it produced no</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">cognitive improvements whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">more kids who went through head start</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">graduated from high school</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">fewer than were delinquent more of them</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">can tell you well not only that but when</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">jensen published his article</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">he also said that since</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">iq increases seem not to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">coming from these intense environmental</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">interventions we should consider the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:32.639" style="s2">possibility that these differences have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">a genetic component</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.639" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">and that really began the incendiary</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">descent of intelligence research to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">periphery</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">yeah the reaction against that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">universal</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">um because it implied a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">inferiority</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t have genes for iq it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">also something that&#39;s universally hated</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">on both sides of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">because on the liberal end</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">you know the idea fundamentally is is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s the same and that if</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">if you distribute education resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">properly then everyone can succeed and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">so that didn&#39;t work out so well for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">liberals and then on the conservative</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">side the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">well if you could just get off your lazy</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">asses and get a job there is a job for</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">you out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">and the truth of the matter is you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">you can tell me what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">this but this was a statistic that just</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">absolutely shocked and staggered me when</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">i went through the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">intelligence literature so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">is illegal in the united states to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">induct anybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">who has an iq of less than 83 and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">reason for that is you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">american armed forces have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">conducting intelligence research for</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">like more than 100 years and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">that was partly because they needed a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">way of sorting people rapidly during</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">times of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">military expansion during war time but</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">it was also because</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">iq tests and especially in the early</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">part of the 20th century were used to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">let&#39;s say the deserving poor who could</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">really benefit from additional</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">educational</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">attainment and advancement and the unit</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">and the military was hoping to identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">people from lower class strata that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">streamed into say officer training</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">programs and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">or even skills training programs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">to move people from the underclass into</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">at least the working class and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">above so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">they had a bloody stake in this man they</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">to find people they wanted to sort them</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">properly and they wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">social good when they weren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">trying to win a war let&#39;s say which</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">often also is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">a social good but what happened was that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember when this legislation</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">was introduced but it wasn&#39;t it was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">the later part of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">but their basic finding was that by say</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">they had determined that if you had an</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">iq of less than 83 there was not a damn</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">thing that the unit</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">that the army could do the armed forces</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">could do to transform you into someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">who could do something that was more</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">productive than</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">non-productive and the territorial thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">about that is that it&#39;s about 10</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">of the population and so you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">statistic like that and you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">oh my god you&#39;ve got this this this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">enterprise this massive enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s chronically hungry for people</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s always they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">looking for people they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">oriented towards taking people from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">underclass and lower working class and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">pushing them up the societal strata and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">during wartime they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">desperate to bring in recruits period</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">and their conclusion is that 10 of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">can&#39;t be trained to do anything anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">sufficiently useful to make them</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">militarily operable it&#39;s just i just</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">read that my jaw just dropped it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">well yeah you know in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">we have about 330 million</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">people and because of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">the relatively normal distribution of iq</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">scores</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">about 16 have iqs of 85</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">or less right right which means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">not going to graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">no it means that from from what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">read practically it means</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">the wonderlic company has actually done</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">a really they have a nice iq test from</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">the commercial perspective you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">actually psychometrically valid</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">and they&#39;ve linked iq levels to uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">to job specifically to job categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">you know yes i</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">yeah i know not and a lot i was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">say is they&#39;re not only not going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to find a a stable</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">job that pays a livable</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">wage yeah now especially even given that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">so many of the service jobs now require</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">a fair high degree of</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">because mcdonald&#39;s is actually very</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">enough to translate what you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">into action</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">so you can&#39;t actually read instructions</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">and follow them you don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">level of literacy</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">that&#39;s correct yeah so so i was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">say that in in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">this bottom 16</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">translates into 51 million people</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">right including 13 million children who</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">are in school</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">right this is a very difficult problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">now i knew earl hunt he passed away last</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">knew him pretty well he also would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">that there is this uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">cognitive segregation in society this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">a point that charles murray makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">yes well and earl would often ask uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">you know when&#39;s the last time you had</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">someone over for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">who wasn&#39;t a college graduate well that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">was something that murray and hernstein</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">wrote about in their book the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">which really struck me because i read</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">that book twice unlike most of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">people who criticized it</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">and you know one of the things that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">they pointed out in there was look</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">the the typically the typical educated</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">thinks that someone isn&#39;t very bright if</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">they have an iq of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">115. so we&#39;re talking about graduate</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">graduate level at phd level</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">research institutions right because 115</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s as many people at 115</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">above as there are at 85</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">and below and so it&#39;s a minority of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">population and that&#39;s the top 15 percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the dollar</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">right so how do you just people have see</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">i&#39;m a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">and i&#39;ve dealt with people who had i</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">ranges in the low 80s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">and tried to find them jobs and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">train them and i i have some real</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">the stunning gap between people at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">low end of the iq distribution in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">high end and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s no bloody wonder people hate iq</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">research and intelligence research</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">it reveals a set of seriously uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">dismal facts about the incredible range</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">of ability among human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">well yes um this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">is true and moreover i would add to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">that people in universities professors</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">and students uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">have a hard time understanding what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">what everyday life is like if you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">an iq of 80</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">right five and you&#39;re making your way</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">you&#39;re living independently you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">making your way in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">but it is a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">it is a real i mean uh just challenges</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">just barely begins to describe it i had</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">i had a client who he probably had an iq</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">of under</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">80 the non-verbal portion of it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">um he was indistinguishable in physical</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">appearance from from</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say i hate to use the frame normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">person but</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing more that marked him out</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">about particularly intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">impaired you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">and uh i tried at one point but this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">this was so so telling to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">i got him a uh an in uh volunteer job</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">which by the way is very difficult it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">harder to get a volunteer job than a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">real job because you have to do police</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">screening and all sorts of things and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">the selection process is just as extreme</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">i eventually ended up getting him a job</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">at a bike store</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">bike slash bookstore and at that place</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hold him once the subsidy</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">program had expired and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">i got him a job at a charity and his job</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">was to fold</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">letters into three so that they could be</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">put into envelopes</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">well that sounds easy except that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">had a bit of a motor trimmer and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">know it took me about 30 hours to train</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">to fold up a piece of paper with</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">sufficient precision so that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">put in an envelope rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">so that the envelope wasn&#39;t so mangled</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">that it would get stuck in the automatic</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">sorting machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">and you know there was high performance</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">demands on him too he had to whip</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">through those letters pretty quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">sometimes the letters would have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">photograph</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">appended to them that was stapled on and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">they weren&#39;t always stapled on in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">same place so then he had to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">how to fold the paper</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">over the photograph without bending the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">photograph in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">precise thirds so that would still fit</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">in the envelope and then he had to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">separate the french letters from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">english letters</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">and associate them with the proper</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">envelopes and like that level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">complexity just did him</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">in everyone so let me let me say two</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">things about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">one is i hope common sense and the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">is pretty provocative</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">the common sense thing is we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">very careful when we have these</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">discussions</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">not to devalue the human dignity of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">who aren&#39;t in the upper end of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">and if there&#39;s one criticism that i</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">think is fair is sometimes in these</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">conversations it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">we&#39;re devaluing people at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">lower end of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">we have to be very careful that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">do that uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">human life has dignity and iq is not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">that defines human yes and means</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not associated with wisdom it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">necessarily associated with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">truth or with courage or with many</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">virtues that that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">being right at all with being likeable</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">or honest yeah that&#39;s right how many of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">you know the psychometrics</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">the psychometric relationship between</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">taught at harvard for a while his name</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">was dean whitlow and he is a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">smart guy i really like dean</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">and you know he was let&#39;s say he was on</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">the right side of the human race and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">he was really trying to figure out how</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">so that it did the best for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">he had run an interesting series of</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">published and one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">um well let&#39;s say you segregate the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">harvard population into the relatively</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">low iq kids so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">maybe they only have an iq of 130 you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">and the relatively high iq kids who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.279" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">pushing up towards 260.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">so you got two competing hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">there one would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">that the lower iq kids</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">um come to harvard this remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">environment and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">and they and and they they thrive</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">because of the high educational quality</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">so well that they close the gap</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">between them and the 160 kids and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">that&#39;s just complete completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">what happens is you put both those</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">groups there both very very highly uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">selected but some you know in this in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">the sort of superman range</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">intellectually and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">what happens is the gap just gets bigger</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">and bigger as they progress through</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a dreaded example of that uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">matthew principle that the economists</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">talk about which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">you know to those who have more will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">given and from those who have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">everything will be taken</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very very it&#39;s no wonder people</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">dislike this research it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">it&#39;s so anti-egalitarian in its</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">in its essential structure well i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">to make a second point that i said would</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">be provocative</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">if you want to do something about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">and you know we tried a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">interventions earnest</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">well-funded long-term interventions</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">to work but neuroscience has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">excluded from discussions about what to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">do about this</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">and i believe that neuroscience the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">progress in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">research has the potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">to really dramatically increase</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">the g factor well that&#39;s an optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">statement so i&#39;m sure we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">forward to some support for that one</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">it&#39;s optimistic and controversial</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">and you know just as a thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">and i can tell you why i believe this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">well first before i tell you the thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">experiment the reason i i&#39;m optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">is that it is because of the high</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">heritability</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">of the g factor that means you know if</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">genes are involved genes work through</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">even if environment interacts with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">basically you have a neurobiological</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s complex but as you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">understand it you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">tweak it this is what all medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">doing now they&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">the neurobiology slash genetic basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">of our health and our diseases why</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">so they can fix it so they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">when you go to the doctor you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">because your biology is broken</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">and you want your biology fixed well</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">the brain now no one conceptualizes low</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">iq</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">as a disease and it&#39;s a little dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">but to the extent to which low iq</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">has a genetic input or a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">influence that&#39;s the extent to which you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">to find out how that works how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">what that system is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">and then figure out how to tweak that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">to increase iq it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">science fiction i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">plausible</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">sequence of events what</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">the the problem is it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">sequence</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">but i also think it&#39;s a finite set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">problems not an infinite set of problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">so you know physicists if physicists can</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">what happened during the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">nanoseconds of the big</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">bang we can certainly figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">what the neurobiology of intellect</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">is and and how to tweak it so i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">so now let&#39;s let&#39;s do a thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">and let&#39;s imagine there&#39;s an iq pill</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">and i mean that metaphorically not</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">literally a pill you could take</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">like putting uh you know a floor but</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">like having fluoridated water just</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">kind of raises the dental health of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">it would be nice if we had that for iq</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">but just imagine what it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">like if we shifted the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">iq</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">15 points into the high end</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">so that now the average iq and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">how iq is computed and norming and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">everything but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">that no one would have an iq less than a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">hundred</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">right what would the world be like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">could reason sufficiently to get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:22.399" style="s2">a reasonable job yeah well that&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">a good question i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.399" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">the the the what would you call the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">perverse part of me that&#39;s funny i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">just talking to one of my graduate</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">um we&#39;ve been looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">determinants of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">male attractiveness by the personality</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">of female</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">viewers okay okay and so what we found</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">there are some personality effects so um</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">extroverted enthusiastic women tend to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">rate men</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">generally speaking as more attractive</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">than introvert and introverted less</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">enthusiastic women and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">um and so so there are some just</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">straight personality effects but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">biggest effect by far we found was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">proclivity of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">of women in general to rape men as less</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">attractive as the women&#39;s iq</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">increased and so the other thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know is what price we pay for</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">for accelerated iq from uh from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">broader perspective you know because i</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">know that there is some evidence and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">can tell me what you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">because i know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">reasonable evidence that the average iq</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">of the ashkenazi jewish population is</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">about 15 points higher than</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">the standard population which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">makes it a thought experiment it&#39;s a or</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:36.159" style="s2">real life experiment that&#39;s equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">to the one that you laid out but</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.159" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">ashkenazi jews also tend to suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:42.039" style="s2">a host of neurological diseases that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">seem to be associated with increased</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.039" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:48.799" style="s2">and so to me it&#39;s often it&#39;s often hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">to gain on one front without losing on</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.799" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">another you know i mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">evolutionary conundrum obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">we call that the social justice theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">if you&#39;re not right</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">on one thing you have to be bad and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">everything else to kind of balance it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">yeah well generally speaking you do pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">a price for your for your exceptionalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s true because uh you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">know the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">the julian stanley studies of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">mathematically precocious kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">essentially found not only were they</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">smart but they were more mature than</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">their age peers</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">better looking they were taller they</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">were physically more fit</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">i mean it was kind of the antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">yeah no no i no that&#39;s true well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just that also might be true</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">that can interfere with iq is poor</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">and and poor nutritional quality and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">of that i mean it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">that easy to increase iq but it looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:44.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s pretty easy to decrease it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">yeah you know uh i think that those</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">those things have to be pretty extreme</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">yeah to have an effect and those effects</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">may not be permanent actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">studies of uh deprivation of people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">suffer</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">suffered deprivation during the second</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">world war</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">uh that suggests that those</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">uh really severe deprivations didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">have lasting effects on them</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">well you know well people are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">tough so i&#39;m inclined to agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">so have you seen any animal experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">experimental work that you regard as</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">compelling that shows</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">something like the transformation of of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">animal cognition into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">into something that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">that&#39;s higher order</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">that that you regard as compelling not</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">sure what you mean but there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">animal work uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">that shows you can extract a g factor</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">from cognitive tests given to various</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">animals right so so what i was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">is has there been</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">any evidence that you regard as credible</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">showing that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">that that say so-called animal g factor</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">extracted in the same we should tell our</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">readers too the way you extract the g</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">factor i&#39;m going to say it very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">rapidly is imagine you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">take a randomly set</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">a randomly selected set of 200 questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">that require abstraction of one form or</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">another to solve</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">and then you give those 200 questions to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">100 people and you sum the scores and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">you rank order them</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">you get something that&#39;s roughly</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:16.640" style="s2">equivalent there to a g factor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">roughly that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.640" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">so just i would say it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">differently just okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">so everyone&#39;s on the same page if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">think of all the different</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">mental abilities and you devised a test</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">for each one of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">and you gave this test to a a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">people across</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">the range of ability what you&#39;ll find is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">the scores on all those tests are</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">positively correlated with each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">all tests of mental ability have</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">something in common right</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">sure that&#39;s a great way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">common is this g factor this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">general ability to reason and some</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">tests have more g-loading than other</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">individual tests</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">right so and tests of abstract reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">tend to be highly g-loaded right said to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">you repeat the following numbers</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">back to me three seven</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">two one six five</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">that&#39;s the not a very highly g loaded</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">mental ability to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">but if i gave you a string like that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">said repeat them to me backwards</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">that becomes a g loaded ability because</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">you do a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">yes well the other thing to say about</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">that too is that the positive</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">relationship between that those multiple</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">assessments that you described is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">actually quite high</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">right right that&#39;s the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">that general factor not only exists</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">domains of cognitive ability but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">tends to account for a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">of the ability in each of those domains</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of like a g is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">a black hole for</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">intelligence research and everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">keeps falling into it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s an interesting way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">because now we have these uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">genome association studies that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">these bits of dna that are related</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">to a latent factor of intelligence which</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">is the g</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">factor or to what they call educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">attainment variables where educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">attainment is so highly correlated with</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">iq</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially the the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">moving when i when i was in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">the question was is there a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">component to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">intelligence or not</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">to this kind of dna analysis</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">trying to find bits of dna that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">going to be related to what we call</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">uh intelligence or iq testing or or the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">g</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">factor and they seem to exist there</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">hundreds of them a tiny effect</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">uh which will make the ultimate story</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">extremely uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">complicated but as i said before i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a finite set of problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">right right at the end of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">sequence of solving those problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a good chance we&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">how to increase iq</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s a good thing to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve said publicly that more</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">intelligence is better than</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">less sometimes i get criticized because</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">that implies that people with less</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t as worthwhile that&#39;s why i want</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">to be very careful that i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">but harder lives is more the accurate</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">and more lives in a narrower range of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">possibilities and opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s right and in my view my political</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">bias is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">therefore governments have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">responsibility to help those people</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">and and a lot of government programs</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">are aren&#39;t going to do it because you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">know job training requires a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">level of g</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">uh and so my low iq clients they used to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">go to the government agencies that were</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">designed to help people find employment</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">and you know the typical</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">response was well just go home and type</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">up your cv and distribute it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">yeah uh you just go like i can&#39;t use a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">i can&#39;t type i don&#39;t know what a cv is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s a non-starter in all</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">three counts</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s right so in the united</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">states there are 51 million people with</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">iqs</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">under 85 and there are about 43 million</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">people living in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">do you think those venn diagrams</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">intersect yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">well we should also be clear about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">because it is so politically suspect is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s self-evident that people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">cognitive capability are likely to end</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">up poor</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">because there are serious complex</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">problems in life that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">beset them that they have a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">time dealing with and they can&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">and so the relationship between poverty</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.079" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">intelligence is self-evident if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">willing to think it through for any</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">length of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">rich that is it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">who is rich is smart and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">that everyone who is</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">poor is stupid what it to to be blunt</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">but what it does mean is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">intelligent you&#39;re much more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">become financially successful and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">i think it was the hernstein hernstein</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">and murray i think did the calculations</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">back in the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">that indicated that if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">you were a fairy godmother and and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">your newborn grandchild in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">and you can grant them</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">three standard deviations above the mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">in terms of wealth at birth or you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">grant them three standard deviations</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">above the mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">in terms of iq at birth and then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">wanted to determine which would work</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">better for them by the time they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">40 and the answer to that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">clear is that iq</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">trump&#39;s wealth right if his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">predict a positive future</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">yeah and that that&#39;s why i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">interested in the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">increasing iq or increasing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">the the g factor not just the iq score</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">but really what under this reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">ability so you know some people have</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">tried to teach</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">college students critical thinking yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">thing it is you can smart and you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">think critically so much the better</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">exactly you know and you know it may</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">sound to your listeners i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">take a moment out here it may sound to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">your listeners like here are these two</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">guys pontificating about what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">to be smart what it&#39;s like to be not so</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">smart</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">i mean the point of this the point of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">neuroscience research on intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">and what i hoped to achieve by writing</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">the book</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">was to show that that the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:02.839" style="s2">aspects are not deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the opposite genes are</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.839" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.160" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">so the extent to which something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">genetic in my view is the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">which we&#39;ll learn how to change it for</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">for the better right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">definitely yeah because people do tend</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">to think about</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">biological factors as deterministic and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">that that&#39;s a mistake because they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">be shifted</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">so with regards to the animal studies so</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">you know you pointed out that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">you can come up with an iq like estimate</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">for say a rat</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">and have you seen anything that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">indicates</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t care how it&#39;s done through</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">training or or or neurochemically</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">or or or by by promoting brain function</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">in different ways however you might do</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">it that&#39;s actually indicated to you that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">there is a way of biologically enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">the general cognitive ability even of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">animal</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">has anything to come out credible just</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">by breeding mice who run a maze</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">faster than other mice together</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">you get mice that seem to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">learn how to run a maze faster but</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s work from the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">right so i review this in in the book</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">there are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">interesting uh technologies that have</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">been developed</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">where you can turn parts</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">of a rat brain on and off at will</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:26.319" style="s2">and see what happens this has not yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">been applied as far as i know</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.319" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">to learning but interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">there are human studies underway</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">with things like trans</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">cranial magnetic stimulation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">electrical ways to low voltage ways to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">stimulate parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">and there are some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">experiments now being done with humans</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">to see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">improve learning or reasoning ability</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">yeah as a matter of fact you know i edit</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:42:00.839" style="s2">this journal called intelligence which</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">is kind of a prime spot for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.839" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">researchers</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">to publish on all aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">and we&#39;re just starting to put together</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">a special issue</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">on human experiments to increase</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">reasoning ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">using these these techniques of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">stimulating the brain</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">are any of you seen you&#39;ve seen some</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">positive things with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">low-level electrical stimulation because</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s also been used</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s more it&#39;s more anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">but there&#39;s a bit of research</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">being used to treat depression for</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">example that&#39;s right and i do cover</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">in the book the the the studies that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">were published up until the time i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">the book and cautioned</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">people that they hadn&#39;t been replicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">right right right but we&#39;re on the way i</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">mean this is this is an evolving area</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be very exciting i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">if students are listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">and they&#39;re thinking about neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">or psychology</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">this kind of experiment is is is really</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">a new phase of intelligence research</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">where you can do experiments on human</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">beings that are completely ethical</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">um and relatively non-intrusive</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">and this is really going to change</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">everything now because it&#39;ll shift</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">intelligence research from basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">correlations yeah past what neuroimaging</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">done which which really moved it away</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">from just psychometrics</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">and then you know correlating</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">psychometric scores with</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">measurable aspects of the brain like</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">glucose metabolic function or the amount</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">of gray matter or white matter or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">white matter fibers i mean all these</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">fabulous connections</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">right right that was a new phase i i got</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">in early on that phase</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">but that phase is now moving into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">new phase</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">of actually stimulating the brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">to improve learning and memory and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">and reasoning and all the while doing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">with neuroimaging right see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">and adding dna to it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">come on now this is a great time to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">entering the research in this area right</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">right well there&#39;s some optimism on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">horizon i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">i looked for a while um because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">been very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">improving human performance measuring it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:31.040" style="s2">and improving it</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.359" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">and uh so i look and and doing that also</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.040" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">in conjunction with businesses because i</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">like things to have a practical end and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">you know i look to find out what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">research indicated with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">improvement of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">mostly what i found was not so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">improvement as conservation is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:49.920" style="s2">if you exercise both aerobically and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">and with weight lifting that that can</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.920" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">help you maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">uh fluid intelligence across for longer</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">across your lifespan because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">tends to decline rather precipitously as</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">you age which is one of the more dismal</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">things that you also discover with iq</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">research and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">it starts to decline when you&#39;re in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">early 20s and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">linear downhill all the way along but</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">exercise really helps</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s preservation which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">pretty important at my</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">age yeah preservation is a big deal man</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.280" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">but enhancement would be good</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">but you know this thing about an iq pill</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">coming up with a way you know to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:31.839" style="s2">manipulate your biology</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">the neurobiology of your brain regarding</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">intellect if there&#39;s a breakthrough in</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">it will come either from alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">or for formal aging research trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">prevent</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">the slow decline of your mental</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">you know as well an iq seems to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">tightly linked to well this is another</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">thing we could talk about because</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">so um i know that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">biological markers that iq</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">is loosely associated with so you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">it it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">fragments it predicts in a fragmentary</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">matter so i know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">even something as simple as simple</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">and um having a bigger head is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">correlated especially when you correct</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">for body size and so is brain mass and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">so is</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">thickness of um the myelin sheaths on</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">there are these there&#39;s these micro</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">markers of you might think about them as</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">neurological integrity that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">predict iq but</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing neuro imaging and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">not as up on that i haven&#39;t looked at</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">that for a couple years so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">what have the neuro imagers found about</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">brain structure and function in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">relationship to intelligence that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">think is compelling and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">glad you asked this because as</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.839" style="s2">i was finishing the manuscript for the</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">literally the day after i turned it in</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">i had to ask for it back because there</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">was this very interesting study</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:21.079" style="s2">published by a group at yale</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">that has uh that used a fairly uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.079" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">sophisticated way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">white matter connections functional</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">and determining how one brain area</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">is uh functionally or structurally</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">structurally related to all other brain</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">and you uh can put up a map of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">of a person&#39;s brain that shows from</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.559" style="s2">their brain is interconnected and this</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.559" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">said these interconnections are so</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">reliable within a person that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">like fingerprints</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">and not only that but the fingerprints</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">can predict</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">iq and so is it density of connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">density of interconnections or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">like that or is there more something</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">more specific going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">it can be the density of of connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">structurally how much</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">white matter connects this area to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">you know and there are certain brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">areas where you have a lot of white</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">matter coming in and a lot of white</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">matter going out to other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">they&#39;re called hubs and there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">nodes that have lesser connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">and so it makes kind of it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">makes sense that being able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">make measurements of brain connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">would be related to things like</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">do you remember what some of the major</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">hubs were like are they identifiable as</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">also as neural anatomical areas with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">specific functions</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">well they&#39;re definitely neural</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">anatomical</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">areas um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re what you might expect</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">but they what was exciting to me is they</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">mapped on to a a model of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">brain intelligence relationships that i</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">developed with my colleague rex young</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">and published in 2007</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s called the parietal frontal</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">integration theory or pfit</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">of intelligence and the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">connections between the parietal lobe</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.800" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">here and the frontal area</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">are the key connections for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">okay so tell us well tell us why you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">derived that particular theory because</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">you know people have suggested</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">say alternatively that the seat of of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:03.040" style="s2">higher order intelligence is basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say the dorsal lateral prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.040" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">cortex or something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">why specifically the connection the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">connection patterns between</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">frontal and and parietal areas well this</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:15.760" style="s2">article in 2007 was a review article</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">where we took</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.760" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">every single brain imaging study we</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">could find</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">that included a measure of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">and there were 37 such studies at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">time including some i had done as early</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">as 1988</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">and others had done with much larger</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">samples</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">and we just kind of qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">analyzed the results</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">to see what brain areas came up in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">common across these</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">studies using different measures</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.559" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">different imaging techniques</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">and we found that that there was not</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">that not all brain areas were equally</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">distributed they tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">concentrated in the front and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">parietal lobe</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">but also we found areas in the occipital</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">lobe and the temporal lobe</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">that were also related to intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">and so we developed this</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">model that we talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">information would be processed and how</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">would flow around this set of i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">there were 18</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">areas all and hypothesized that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">people scored high on intelligence tests</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">would have some combination of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">areas you didn&#39;t need all of them kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">of working together</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.359" style="s2">but some people would have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">combination some people would have that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">combination</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">and if you could make measurements of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">about the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">information was flowing around these</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">areas with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">technology like the magnetoencephalogram</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">which shows changes in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">millisecond by milliseconds</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.920" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">then you might be able to uh actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">estimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">iq from brain images 2007 people were</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">with multiple regression equations it</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">never really replicated independent</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">replications didn&#39;t go very far</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">yeah because the sample sizes were</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">relatively small you have enormous</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">individual differences</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">but these newer techniques these</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">data it seemed like there was</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">considerable overlap</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">when they wrote their papers noted that</p>

<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">we have yes there were there were more</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">there were also areas on the right as</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">and these areas tend to be areas that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">are also related</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">to uh language and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:13.839" style="s2">memory and attention so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">more fundamental cognitive processes of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.839" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">language and memory and attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">seem to be the the architecture on which</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">intelligence is great</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">right hey do you here&#39;s a question that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">i haven&#39;t been able to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve looked at the attention literature</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">a lot and the more</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">i look at the attention literature the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">more i find it difficult to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">it from the intelligence literature i</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">attention and intelligence seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">different things and we certainly use</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">the words in common parlance as</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">different but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">i haven&#39;t really been able to like</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">imagine you wanted to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">battery of attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">related tests that were independent of</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">uh cognitive abilities i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:57.040" style="s2">anybody manage that and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">do do you what do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.040" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">difference is between the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">which also seems to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">conscientiousness by the way which</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t associated with iq but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship between intent</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">attention and intelligence as far as</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">you&#39;re concerned those studies have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">done where they take</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">cognitive variables the elemental</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">tasks is what they call them the real</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">basic things that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">psychologists like to study</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">because they like to study reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">right you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">and they&#39;ll study learning and memory</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">but they don&#39;t want to address why some</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:33.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">learn faster than other people or why</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">some people can remember more than other</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a cognitive psychologist study</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">they study what&#39;s common to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">but if you look at these elemental</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">cognitive tasks you can extract</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">a g factor of cognition which is highly</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">correlated with a psychometric g</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">factor</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">more than attention memory aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">memory are more correlated to the g</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">factor uh processing speed is correlated</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">sure and the tension is also correlated</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">so you know i kind of have this uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">idea from being a parent watching</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">my kids grow up that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">people differ in their baseline</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">of attention when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:27.440" style="s2">specifically paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">this might be called consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">you know you have two kids walking</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">through a museum for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">and you come out and you say the kid one</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">so what did you see</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">and you get a whole long thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">ask the other kid well what did you see</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">there and you get a much</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">less rich explanation</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">yeah of what i&#39;ve always thought about</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">that as a difference in resolution of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">worlds well you&#39;ll call it what you will</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:54.720" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">there are these differences and uh you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.720" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">know we have that we&#39;ve actually studied</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:01.319" style="s2">consciousness with brain imaging uh with</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">my friend mike alkire who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.319" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">anesthesiologist we did the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">imaging studies</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">where we brought normal volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">in and mike gave them</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">anesthetic drugs to knock them out</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">completely while they underwent brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:19.359" style="s2">imaging</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">and we had different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.359" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">anesthesia we were trying to see what</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">part of the brain is the last part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">the brain to turn off when you lose</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re listening and did you find</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">anything that you could make sense out</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">of from that because that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">of course that&#39;s obviously an</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">i mean is it the collapse of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">networks is well</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">challenging i&#39;m just the real expert on</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">this he&#39;s published a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">papers and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">the the mechanism of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">still one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">nobel prize winning yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s my interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">literature too it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:56.559" style="s2">it it it&#39;s it&#39;s such a mystery that</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">it seems uncrackable in some sense well</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.559" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">what was good about</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">the imaging stuff here you could study</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">this experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">yep you know you could you could put</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">people in into different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">and bring them out at will and see what</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">how the the brain reacted so the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">thalamus seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">important a lot of people you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">thalamus connections</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">uh and each anesthetic there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">categories of anesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">and they work they have different</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:28.559" style="s2">mechanisms of action in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">yet they all produce the same uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.559" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">consequence when you lose consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">right that&#39;s an in that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">interesting thing too</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:37.200" style="s2">so that i know with the thalamic uh what</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">corticothalamic loops i mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">guy named</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">what&#39;s his name voldemire god it&#39;s close</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid it hasn&#39;t haven&#39;t got it</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">right he suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">um one of the one of the consequences of</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">cortical circuitry and and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">one of the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">whereby that expanded at least sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">consciousness emerges as a cons</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">you know as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">experimentation with this with</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">the psychedelic end of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">pharmaceutical universe yeah i have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">section in the in the book where i talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">consciousness and these studies and try</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.319" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">to relate</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">the concept that if you can turn</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">off you should be able to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">on we know anesthesiologists do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">at will yep even though they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.280" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">understand what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">right right you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">they can&#39;t tell you why it works but</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">then can you use if if anesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">drugs kind of dissociate the brain</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">and creativity seems to be related to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">dissociation of the frontal lobes</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">can low doses very</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">very low doses of anesthetic drugs</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">cause just enough dis inhibition</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">to increase your creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:14.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this experiment has ever</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">been done well i know you see something</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.960" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">similar in that sometimes reported with</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">people who developed frontotemporal</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">dementia</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right you know is that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange phenomenon where</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">as your brain deteriorates your</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:29.040" style="s2">creativity increases</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">because so much of brain function seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.040" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">to be inhibitory</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know of a comparable disease</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:38.480" style="s2">that produces increases in intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">right no no i&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">in that in oh yeah the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s been so you tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">think about this i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">i was curious for a while about these</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">companies like lumosity because</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">when we developed our original</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">prefrontal tasks they weren&#39;t tests they</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">were they kind of had a game-like</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">element you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">and we kind of thought well maybe if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:01.520" style="s2">had people practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">doing them they would obviously get</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">better at the specific task because that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">is what people do but then if you had</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:07.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">practice a whole bunch of them maybe</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.760" end="01:00:11.119" style="s2">they would get better at the whole</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">at the entirety of the tasks in a way</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">that would generalize to other</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">to other measures like like the ravens</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">progressive matrices which is a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:21.599" style="s2">measure of fluid intelligence but</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:23.119" style="s2">that never works and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.599" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">lumosity people</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.119" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">claimed that they were able to produce</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">enhancement general intelligence but</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">by all appearances appearances that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.359" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">been that&#39;s been a dismal failure as</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it it&#39;s very strange in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">that that general factor doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">be something that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">improve</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:43.280" style="s2">by practice right well you know what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">hell why</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.280" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">why i can&#39;t just i just don&#39;t get that</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:48.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense but</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">here&#39;s something you don&#39;t know about me</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.880" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">albert but i am in the guinness book of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">records the gamers edition because of my</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">study my brain imaging study of tetris</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">and i did a brain imaging study of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">tetris i think it was published in 1992.</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">i i really wanted to do a study of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">warning i wanted to see what happened in</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">before and after you learn something</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">back in 1991 when i was doing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">nobody had personal computers nobody had</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">ever heard of tetris</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">computer games were not what they are</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">right and i went to the egghead software</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">store when they had software stores that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">had just opened</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">and i was talking to the guys there</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">about i needed something</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">where i could study before and after</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">they learned</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">something relatively simple yep they</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.640" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">showed me this game tetris it had just</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">come in they just</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">opened the box they put it up on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">computer there and i thought boy this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">really perfect it&#39;s simple to learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.799" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">but there&#39;s an enormous learning curve</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">and we we brought in</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">uh college students a small number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:57.359" style="s2">college students</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">and we showed them how to play tetris</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.359" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">they practiced for a few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">we injected the radioactive glucose for</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">positron emission tomography</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">and we did pet scan studies of them that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">very first day they played tetris for</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">32 minutes they then practiced every day</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">they had to come to my office because</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:18.559" style="s2">nobody had a pc at home</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">they came to my office five days a week</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.559" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">for about four weeks</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">they practiced until they got so good at</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">tetris you know the game was moving</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s amazing how good people</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">can get at that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t even believe a human being</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">could do that yeah i know it&#39;s i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">watched people do that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just absolutely unbelievable how</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">good they can get at it</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">right and when they got really good we</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">scanned them a second time</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:44.319" style="s2">and we found that even though the game</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:46.319" style="s2">was faster and harder</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.319" end="01:02:48.160" style="s2">when they had learned how to do it they</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.319" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">used less glucose metabolic</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.160" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">rate okay so now was that also okay so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">knew that research i read that research</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">that what do you think about the now the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">problem is i can&#39;t remember where this</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">research came from because i also read</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">at approximately the same time studies</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">that appeared to</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">claim and i think this was reviewed by</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">el conan goldberg in his book on uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">on hemispheric specialization for</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:15.039" style="s2">routinization and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">and novelty respectively that as you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.039" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">when you first start to learn something</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">novel and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">i think this was demonstrated for</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">example in people who were listening</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">they were danish native speakers who</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.440" style="s2">were listening to danish in reverse</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">and they used very large part portions</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.440" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">of their brain when they were listening</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">to danish in reverse</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">but if they were listening to danish</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">properly spoken they used very small</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">specified parts of their brain that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">located in the latter or</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">in the back part of the of the left</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">hemisphere and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:44.319" style="s2">there was another group of researchers</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">who were demonstrating that as you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.319" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:50.000" style="s2">the degree of activation decreased and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">it shifted from the right to left and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.000" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">shifted from the front to the back and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">it got smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">and is that associated with that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:57.280" style="s2">decreased glucose utilization is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.280" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">phenomena i i think it is i think we</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">were the first to</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">to show it and we had done once one</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">imaging study before this tetris study</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:10.799" style="s2">where we just</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">correlated uh glucose metabolic rate</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.799" end="01:04:14.480" style="s2">with scores on a test of abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">reasoning the high g</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.480" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">loaded test ravens they had taken the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">during the imaging so we got to see what</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">brain areas were involved and we did</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">find some brain areas but the really</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:28.160" style="s2">interesting surprising thing was</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">the correlation between the scores and</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.160" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">glucose metabolic rate</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">was always negative better they did on</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">the test the lower their glucose</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">metabolic rate</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:39.359" style="s2">and that was the first inkling we had</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">about this idea of brain deficiency</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.359" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">right that there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">research on that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">uh and it turns out to be a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">thing because nothing about the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:52.559" style="s2">right but it does seem to make perfect</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">sense that expert skill is associated</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.559" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">with doing more with less</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">it makes sense now but i tell you nobody</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">predicted it and no no i</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">look i understand that&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">research that research stood out for me</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">in a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">in a very uh you know in in a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">striking manner</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">so it also gets at this thing about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">you raised about</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:15.039" style="s2">practicing on different kinds of tests</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:15.520" style="s2">because one of the attractive things</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.039" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.520" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">tetris is it&#39;s visual spatial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:26.000" style="s2">planning ahead it&#39;s a tension</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">there are a lot of elemental cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.000" end="01:05:28.319" style="s2">tasks</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">necessary you know it&#39;s fine motor</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.319" end="01:05:33.359" style="s2">control really necessary</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">to to do well on tetris and to learn it</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">really well</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.480" style="s2">and so the tetris company found my</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">some years later and asked if i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">willing to try to replicate it with more</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">modern imaging which of course i was</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.920" end="01:05:50.880" style="s2">willing to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">and so they funded this and</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.880" end="01:05:54.720" style="s2">we found now instead of pet scanning we</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">use functional mri</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.720" end="01:06:00.480" style="s2">and structural mri both and we did find</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:02.000" style="s2">like we found with the pet scanning</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.480" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">there were areas</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.000" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">where after teenage girls with very</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">limited gaming experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">learned tetris uh their</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">brain activity decreased</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">but we also found from</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">the structural mri that there were</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">increases in gray matter</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">and the really interesting thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">areas where there were increases in gray</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">did not overlap at all</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">with the areas that functionally</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:37.680" style="s2">decreased it would have been a terrific</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:39.119" style="s2">story wow</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.680" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s strange yeah well things are</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.119" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">always more complicated than you hope</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">them to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">not only that but i can tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">every time i did a brain imaging study</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:52.559" style="s2">we always found the exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">what we expected</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">was that that sounds to me like you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">you might actually be</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">uh be operating as a real scientist well</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">i mean things are so damn complicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s really difficult to guess</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">right to begin with well it led to one</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:11.039" style="s2">of my three laws that i</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">based the book on law number one is no</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.039" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">story about the brain is simple</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">law number two is no one study is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">definitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">and law number three is it takes a long</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">time to sort out</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">all the various studies to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">consistent and what establishes a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">reliable weight of evidence</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:30.160" style="s2">okay so let me put you on a different</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">track momentarily and maybe this won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.160" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">work but but</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">but you know i&#39;m always curious about uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:39.119" style="s2">let&#39;s say the practical implications of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">scientific research both at</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.119" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">a personal level familial level social</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">level all of those things you know so</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">i mean one of the things that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">planning to do in the near future is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">launch a website</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">that will enable people to assess</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">themselves with what we&#39;ve developed a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">scale called the big five aspect scale</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">that breaks the big five</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.640" end="01:07:59.520" style="s2">down into ten aspects each of which</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">which provides some additional high</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.520" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.079" style="s2">and useful descriptions of personality</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:05.760" style="s2">so you&#39;ll be able to go there and find</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.079" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">out what your personality is like</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.760" end="01:08:08.799" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to compare yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.119" end="01:08:10.480" style="s2">other people who you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.799" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">to find out where your similarities and</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">differences are but one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve been thinking about doing as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.480" end="01:08:19.440" style="s2">is putting up on the same site a real iq</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">test like nicely validated</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">probably focusing on fluid intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:26.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:26.880" style="s2">less linguistically complex to do so but</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.880" end="01:08:30.480" style="s2">measuring verbal intelligence and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">showing people</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.480" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">the strata of occupations in which</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">they&#39;re likely to find maximal success</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">because you know from for me given that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:42.480" style="s2">i know that that people vary in their</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:43.679" style="s2">cognitive abilities tremendously and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.480" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually an important</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.679" end="01:08:46.239" style="s2">determinant of their life outcome it</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.239" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">so let&#39;s say someone tests out in an iq</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">of around 115</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">and so you could say look you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty damn smart you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">up above 85 percent of the general</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">you you could you could probably do a</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:03.040" style="s2">pretty damn good job as an undergraduate</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">university if you&#39;re also disciplined</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.040" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">right if you were conscientious you hit</p>

<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not at a spectacularly successful</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">uh spectacularly selective university</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.679" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have a much more</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">difficult time as a master student and</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.679" end="01:09:23.040" style="s2">phd level stuff is going to be</p>

<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">but you know you could be here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:31.600" style="s2">here&#39;s a domain of</p>

<p begin="01:09:31.600" end="01:09:35.520" style="s2">industrial organizational activity where</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">you could really be in the top</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.520" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">10 percentile you know it&#39;s like so if</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">you have an iq of 115 like you might</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">make one bang-up plumber</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">and you could have a spectacularly</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.920" style="s2">successful career as a plumber and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">as a manager of other plumbers and all</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.920" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">of that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:52.640" style="s2">you know and i mean i actually happen to</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">be a real aficionado of the trade so i</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.640" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t think of that as</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:58.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a low quality or low status</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">occupation in the least</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.480" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">but we would we would like to tell</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:05.840" style="s2">people okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">here&#39;s an intellectual domain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">probably too high for you to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">successful without working</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:19.120" style="s2">insane hours to to to to close the gap</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">because you can do that with insane work</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.120" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">up to some some limited degree</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">but it seems to me that the logical</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.960" style="s2">thing to do at least in part is to</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">give people a sense of what their</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.960" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">advantages and limitations are</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:32.960" style="s2">and then say to them okay well given</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">that here is a place that you could go</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.960" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">where you could be optimally successful</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:40.400" style="s2">and so you know that&#39;s kind of my take</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">from a policy perspective let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:44.000" style="s2">like what have you thought about you</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:45.760" style="s2">know the massive diversity</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">and intellectual ability i mean what are</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.760" end="01:10:49.280" style="s2">the implications from a policy</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:51.199" style="s2">perspective as far as you&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.280" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">well i think vocational guidance is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:54.880" style="s2">clearly one i actually did some</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">consulting and some research for a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.880" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">non-profit</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">group called the johnson o&#39;connor</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">foundation which is uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:05.199" style="s2">vocational testing they&#39;re not that big</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:05.920" style="s2">on g but they have their own battery of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.199" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">tests</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.920" end="01:11:11.840" style="s2">they bring someone in um and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">do a full day of cognitive tests and</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.840" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:17.360" style="s2">they give some advice about what kinds</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">of professions</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.360" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">match their cognitive strengths and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">weaknesses</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">and i actually did some brain imaging on</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">their tests and was very you know very</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">um what do you think they do did you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:33.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard to do the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">psychometrics properly with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.600" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">vocational</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">guidance because we don&#39;t really know we</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have a good handle on how to</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">classify</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:43.600" style="s2">jobs into their various subtypes like</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:44.640" style="s2">john holland has done some good work</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:46.719" style="s2">doing that but</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.640" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s so many jobs and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.719" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:51.040" style="s2">well what makes two jobs the same or</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:53.040" style="s2">similar you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.040" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">well i was at hopkins when holland was</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.040" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">there and some of my</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:58.560" style="s2">friends were graduate students worked</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">for him and i learned all about that</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.560" end="01:12:01.920" style="s2">vocational testing it&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:05.280" style="s2">and as you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.920" end="01:12:08.159" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s more his his scales have</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.280" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">kind of morphed into more personality</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.159" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">like dimensions yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s it you want that well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:14.320" style="s2">exactly the nexus that we want to play</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.040" end="01:12:16.320" style="s2">at it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.320" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">because there is a reason i know people</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">have been mapping holland&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">holland&#39;s job categories onto the big</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:23.600" style="s2">five and with a fair bit of success</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">you know and we&#39;re hoping that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.600" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">differentiation down to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:28.880" style="s2">to ten levels of personality will</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.120" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">provide even more precision</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.880" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">but but with more general policy let</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">okay so fine so</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:36.719" style="s2">reasonable vocational counseling that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.719" end="01:12:39.920" style="s2">when does it start is starting junior</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.920" end="01:12:43.840" style="s2">like do you do what the europeans do and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">start to track people into trades and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.840" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">and and higher ed education at that kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:50.239" style="s2">of early age</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">europeans seem to have had great success</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.239" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s certainly the germans in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">particular yeah so it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:58.719" style="s2">look at but the problem in the united</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">states there are so many problems with</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.719" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">the way we</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">uh conceptualize education</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">and the whole idea of tracking i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">know how it is in canada but in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">united states this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:14.080" style="s2">tracking has a very negative balance to</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">you know segregating the smart kids into</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:20.320" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">one set of classes and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.320" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">the the less mark gives into others and</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">then there&#39;s remedial education</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s been a tendency a strong</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">tendency in the united states</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:33.440" style="s2">to feel that kids learn from each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.840" style="s2">so you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.440" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">homogeneous groups based on learning</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.840" end="01:13:39.280" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:39.760" style="s2">you want uh yeah it&#39;s so funny though</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.280" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.760" end="01:13:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so funny because the people say</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">that with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.440" end="01:13:47.679" style="s2">to let&#39;s say academic achievement but</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:49.520" style="s2">they play exactly the opposite stunt</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.679" end="01:13:52.000" style="s2">when it comes to such things as</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.520" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">as childhood sports you know so if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.000" end="01:13:54.640" style="s2">look at football for example it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">well hey</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.640" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">let&#39;s segregate likeability it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:13:59.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the people who stumble</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:00.159" style="s2">around on the field dropping the ball</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.600" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.159" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">playing with the top end quarterbacks</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">and nobody thinks there&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:06.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.239" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">they don&#39;t say well everyone learns from</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.000" end="01:14:11.280" style="s2">everyone else in that situation so</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:13.920" style="s2">to me it be speaks more of a refusal</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.280" end="01:14:15.520" style="s2">to admit to the stark reality that there</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.920" end="01:14:16.960" style="s2">are massive cognitive differences</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.520" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">between people and to try to</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.960" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">actually start to address that with some</p>

<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">and the seriousness should be something</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.840" end="01:14:24.159" style="s2">like okay well let&#39;s look at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">15</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.159" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">of the population cognitively speaking</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">what the hell can we do for those people</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:33.120" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be useful and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">you know like the guy that i was telling</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">you about i was trying to think of some</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:40.960" style="s2">way that he could find uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.040" end="01:14:42.960" style="s2">uh respectable and productive</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.960" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">and relatively stable position in</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.960" end="01:14:45.920" style="s2">society that would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:47.679" style="s2">useful and i thought there was a couple</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.920" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">of things he could do like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.679" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">things he could have done i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:55.840" style="s2">he could have been encouraged let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.320" end="01:14:57.679" style="s2">to to collect trash in the downtown</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.840" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">areas like he could have been assigned a</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.679" end="01:15:00.880" style="s2">city block</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">and and it could have been said to him</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.880" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">look your job is to keep this</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:08.159" style="s2">damn city block clean here&#39;s a bag</p>

<p begin="01:15:08.159" end="01:15:11.600" style="s2">you go do this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.520" end="01:15:13.520" style="s2">makes everybody&#39;s life more pleasant</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.600" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a valuable contribution</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.520" end="01:15:16.719" style="s2">it&#39;s something you could do with a</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:18.400" style="s2">certain degree of pride and it and</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.719" end="01:15:18.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a socially valuable end of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.400" end="01:15:20.480" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.719" end="01:15:22.159" style="s2">what happens in toronto is that people</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.480" end="01:15:25.280" style="s2">drive around these</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.159" end="01:15:26.480" style="s2">vacuum cleaner machines on sidewalks and</p>

<p begin="01:15:28.560" end="01:15:32.320" style="s2">actually turns out to be a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:34.000" style="s2">cognitively demanding job because</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.320" end="01:15:35.520" style="s2">well you have to pay careful attention</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.000" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t run over people you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">have decent social skills and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:40.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s complicated but it might</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:42.320" style="s2">be nice to see</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.400" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">but we but we&#39;re not mature enough to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.320" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">have a discussion like this as a society</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:47.679" style="s2">we might want to say it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.679" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">going to be able to compete</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.440" end="01:15:54.960" style="s2">in the in the cognitive</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.960" end="01:15:57.520" style="s2">do it and there&#39;s actually lots of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:15:58.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.520" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to say they&#39;re lazy and</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.960" end="01:16:01.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to say they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:03.280" style="s2">looking for work we&#39;re not going to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.280" end="01:16:06.640" style="s2">any of that we&#39;re going to say look</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">we need to find occupations</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.640" end="01:16:11.440" style="s2">that have public utility that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.360" end="01:16:14.480" style="s2">just make work projects that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.440" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">people of that level of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.480" end="01:16:19.440" style="s2">abstract capacity could actually perform</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:21.360" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think we have the maturity</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.440" end="01:16:23.679" style="s2">to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.360" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the economics and so i i</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.679" end="01:16:26.719" style="s2">would go even a little to the left of</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:30.080" style="s2">you and i would say there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:33.040" style="s2">wrong with make work programs</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.080" end="01:16:34.400" style="s2">you know to to to allow people i mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.040" end="01:16:36.480" style="s2">you have you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.400" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">to work with dignity so you have that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.480" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">option but you also have this</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:43.199" style="s2">uh experiment being proposed of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">minimum annual income</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.199" end="01:16:46.719" style="s2">yeah well that one worries me because</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">see there&#39;s a couple of things about</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.719" end="01:16:50.320" style="s2">that one that concerns me</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">because you know so we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:55.840" style="s2">conversation here where we&#39;re taking uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.360" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">differences in iq seriously but the</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.840" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">guaranteed annual income issue i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:03.440" style="s2">one of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:05.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m not denying its potential</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.440" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">utility it&#39;s something i think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.040" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">would have to be experimentally</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:09.600" style="s2">determined you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">and all of that and maybe it could</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.600" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">replace a plethora of less efficient</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:17.120" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:20.320" style="s2">welfare programs but you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.120" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious to me it&#39;s obvious to</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.320" end="01:17:23.679" style="s2">me that there&#39;s a substantial proportion</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">of the population and i would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.679" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">probably five percent</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">that would destroy themselves instantly</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.760" end="01:17:31.600" style="s2">if you gave them a guaranteed</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">annual income and they would do it</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.600" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re very low in</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:37.120" style="s2">conscientiousness for example</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.480" style="s2">and very impulsive and like i&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.120" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">with many guys</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.480" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">often ex-cocaine addicts who were often</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:42.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:44.800" style="s2">all that high on the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.800" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">cognitive distribution but very very low</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:49.120" style="s2">conscientiousness high in impulsivity</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:51.360" style="s2">and those guys were absolutely fine as</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.120" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">long as they were flat broke</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.360" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">but man i tell you as soon as they had</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:57.040" style="s2">money they were done</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">it was like three days in the bar</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.040" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">cocaine binge</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">face down in a ditch and then they were</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:05.120" style="s2">fine until they got money again</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.120" end="01:18:09.600" style="s2">guaranteed annual</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:11.679" style="s2">income solution is that you know man</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.600" end="01:18:12.400" style="s2">does not live by bread alone let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.679" end="01:18:14.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.400" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">that if you have money and you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.880" end="01:18:18.080" style="s2">things to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:19.280" style="s2">then you have a life but if you just</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.080" end="01:18:21.920" style="s2">have money</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.280" end="01:18:23.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a life well you know i</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.920" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.040" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">you know i have a very narrow lens on</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">this what do i know about the big social</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:30.480" style="s2">policies and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.480" end="01:18:33.600" style="s2">that more than anybody else i have</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:36.840" style="s2">opinions like everybody</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.600" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">but my narrow lens is through</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.840" end="01:18:42.480" style="s2">intelligence yep i think more is</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:44.000" style="s2">better than less yeah more doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.480" end="01:18:45.760" style="s2">you a better person</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make you honest doesn&#39;t make you</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.760" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">likeable doesn&#39;t make you conscient does</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:50.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.920" end="01:18:54.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t solve the problems of the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.960" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">but if we can do something to increase</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.239" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">intelligence generally i think that</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:01.520" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:02.560" style="s2">go in some measure toward alleviating a</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.520" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.560" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">these uh very complex problems</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">so imagine the homelessness problem some</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:13.880" style="s2">proportion of chronically homeless</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">people have schizophrenia yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.880" end="01:19:19.040" style="s2">schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">is a genetic disorder nobody knows what</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.040" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">the genes are</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">or how they work but it&#39;s pretty clear</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:27.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a genetic component</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.480" end="01:19:28.719" style="s2">if you can find the genes figure out</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:31.600" style="s2">what they do</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.719" end="01:19:31.920" style="s2">and come up with real good treatments if</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.600" end="01:19:34.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.920" end="01:19:37.040" style="s2">cures for schizophrenia and possibly</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.800" end="01:19:38.800" style="s2">preventions for schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.040" end="01:19:41.040" style="s2">that indirectly is going to help</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.800" end="01:19:42.640" style="s2">alleviate the homeless problem right</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.040" end="01:19:44.719" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know what to do about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.640" end="01:19:45.800" style="s2">homeless but if you can figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.719" end="01:19:48.719" style="s2">to do about</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.800" end="01:19:51.199" style="s2">schizophrenia that&#39;s going to have some</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.719" end="01:19:52.800" style="s2">impact on that yes it&#39;s basically yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.199" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">well use you know your claim</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.800" end="01:19:56.400" style="s2">to some degree is that these more</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:58.800" style="s2">complex social problems should be</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.400" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">decomposed into isolatable micro</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:02.080" style="s2">problems and that specific solution</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">should be sought for them and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.080" end="01:20:05.760" style="s2">that certainly strikes me as an</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:07.360" style="s2">appropriate approach because everybody</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.760" end="01:20:09.679" style="s2">is different not everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.360" end="01:20:10.960" style="s2">for the same reason no no well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.679" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">for sure that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.960" end="01:20:14.400" style="s2">not everyone&#39;s poor for the same for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:15.840" style="s2">same reason by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.400" end="01:20:18.159" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.840" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s right poverty is doesn&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.159" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">cause no</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.520" end="01:20:25.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s not merely caused by lack of</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.520" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">money either because that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.120" end="01:20:29.280" style="s2">much easier problem to solve</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:30.560" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s not so simple so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.280" end="01:20:31.840" style="s2">one thing that we&#39;re probably getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.560" end="01:20:34.000" style="s2">toward the end the one thing i would</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.840" end="01:20:37.199" style="s2">like to leave your listeners with</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.000" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">is really optimism these are not dismal</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.199" end="01:20:42.000" style="s2">problems in perpetuity because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:45.199" style="s2">genetic approach</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.000" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">i think and i&#39;m kind of out you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.199" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">kind of out there</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:49.679" style="s2">on this this is not a mainstream view</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:51.440" style="s2">but i think the more something is</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.679" end="01:20:53.280" style="s2">genetic the more likely it is we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:55.520" style="s2">change it for the good</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.280" end="01:20:56.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we just should study the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.520" end="01:20:59.520" style="s2">genetics of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.400" end="01:21:02.719" style="s2">intelligence that&#39;s why i hope genes</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.520" end="01:21:05.040" style="s2">have more to do with it that environment</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.719" end="01:21:06.639" style="s2">not you know not yet because i i want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.040" end="01:21:09.199" style="s2">do something nefarious with</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.639" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">genes and i understand the history of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.199" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">this very</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">yes yes because i think in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:17.679" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s optimism and to guard</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:19.840" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.679" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">the negative aspects the potential</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.840" end="01:21:23.280" style="s2">negative aspects of this</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">the only solution is to have public</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.280" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">conversation about this</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:29.040" style="s2">and to get people to understand iq</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.840" end="01:21:31.360" style="s2">intelligence g</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.040" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">factor these are not all the same things</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.360" end="01:21:34.480" style="s2">they have different relationships to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.480" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">to the genetic data particularly so we</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:41.679" style="s2">have to understand these things</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:42.159" style="s2">and once we have some sense of this and</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:44.719" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">paint people who believe in that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.719" end="01:21:50.159" style="s2">a genetic component as</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:53.199" style="s2">as our as a priori racist or malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.159" end="01:21:55.520" style="s2">people um i think we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.199" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">we can come to a common understanding</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.520" end="01:22:00.000" style="s2">about how genes and environment</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:00.800" style="s2">interact and figure out how all that</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.000" end="01:22:05.600" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.800" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">and begin to think how in the year 2050</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.600" end="01:22:11.360" style="s2">or 2060 we&#39;re going to have to resolve</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:12.960" style="s2">people have resolved some of these</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.360" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.960" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">to practical benefit well that is a good</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:18.719" style="s2">place to leave it i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:20.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a very productive discussion</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.719" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.320" end="01:22:25.280" style="s2">nice place to to to bring everything to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">a close i&#39;ve been speaking with dr</p>

<p begin="01:22:51.120" end="01:22:56.719" style="s2">the undeniable primacy of intelligence</p>

<p begin="01:23:10.960" end="01:23:14.800" style="s2">to you perhaps about consciousness at</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.400" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">some point that might be entertaining</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.800" end="01:23:18.960" style="s2">well listen i&#39;ve really enjoyed it i</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:20.800" style="s2">appreciate the chance of having more</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:30.960" style="s2">uh i just want to say one thing about</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.440" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">the book it is written</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:34.719" style="s2">for the way public as well oh okay well</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.360" end="01:23:36.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to know</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:37.760" style="s2">cambridge wouldn&#39;t let me call it the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:39.840" style="s2">neuroscience of</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.760" end="01:23:42.159" style="s2">intelligence calling what every parent</p>

<p begin="01:23:42.159" end="01:23:46.719" style="s2">about neuroscience but because they</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.120" end="01:23:47.920" style="s2">wanted to market it as a strictly</p>

<p begin="01:23:47.920" end="01:23:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s getting quite a bit of attention</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.760" end="01:23:53.679" style="s2">just among uh non-academic groups okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.000" end="01:23:54.000" style="s2">well excellent well i&#39;ll i&#39;ll make sure</p>

<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:00.719" style="s2">i&#39;ll post a link to the book probably on</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.280" end="01:24:02.080" style="s2">amazon</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.719" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">that&#39;s usually the most straightforward</p>
