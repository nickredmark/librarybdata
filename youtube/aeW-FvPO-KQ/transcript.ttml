<p begin="00:00:09.679" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">those lines and she posted a video a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">week ago that she&#39;s going through an</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">and watching that video of her talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:21.760" style="s2">about it was eye-opening</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:23.119" style="s2">in why again influence our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.760" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">not who we want to be looking to for</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.119" end="00:00:27.920" style="s2">this particular crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">because they are new to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.920" end="00:00:31.359" style="s2">an existential crisis is a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:33.040" style="s2">phenomenon to them</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:34.880" style="s2">the people i know who are in game b the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">people i know who are saving the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.880" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">are people who are the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:40.480" style="s2">influencers who have had</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">the happen to them health-wise</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.480" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">family-wise</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">trauma-wise their whole life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">strangely that doesn&#39;t lead to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">wanting to be on youtube and wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">share that and broadcast that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.480" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">and so um but it does lead to having</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.480" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">gone through an existential crisis your</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">whole life</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">and so the people who are better</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">prepared for this crisis are the very</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">ones who will not be the influencers</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">and the influencers are going through</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">the existential crisis just like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">but they&#39;re babies at it they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a brand new feeling to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">and that i was like oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.280" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">existential crisis i&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">since i was a child</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">especially since i was a teenager when</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">christianity evaporated from my life and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">was like oh what do you mean the church</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">and god aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">real what&#39;s real um</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.520" style="s2">she talks about in the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">video she&#39;s mentioned some backhand com</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">comments about how she&#39;s she&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">depressed right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">but how she&#39;s not like one of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">people who wears it as like part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.840" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">their personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">and i&#39;m like right because it&#39;s not part</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">of your personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">your baseline is pretty happy my</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">baseline is pretty happy</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">to feel and yet when i get down for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">day or two it sucks it sucks for</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to this darkness i know</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">there&#39;s an end it ends in two days</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">always every time i can&#39;t do it for</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">three or four days like it can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">i have to have that light my body gives</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">it to me my mind gives it to me because</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not your normal</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s not my normal but if it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">your normal getting down on those people</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s part of their personality</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">yeah strangely strangely it is part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">their personality</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">they&#39;re not and she talks about how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">know that the content she makes that she</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">wants to make isn&#39;t necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s watched the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">and so she has to tweak her stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s part of being an influencer</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">influencer culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">is that it&#39;s you it&#39;s not your authentic</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">self putting out authentic content that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">gets the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">engagement that gets some engagement but</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">then you&#39;re so you start tweaking that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">message so you get even more engagement</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">even more engagement and then you become</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">the thing that gets engagement as</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">opposed to what you were there to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">present in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">so the people who&#39;ve been going through</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">existential crisis as their whole life</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">who&#39;ve been going through trauma</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">who&#39;ve had chronic illness people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">had mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">people who have you know family trauma</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">and abuse</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">generally even the influencers who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">that stuff they&#39;ll have their one-off</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">videos where they talk about it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">definitely not it&#39;s like oh yeah i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">want that to define me</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a very different space to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">than being that depressed person</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">than being that person in an existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">crisis all of the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to give them the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">influence at all yet they&#39;re exactly who</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">we need to be influencers right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">like the very people who look like they</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">don&#39;t have their together</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">kiki looks like she has her kylie looks</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">like she has her together</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">and she does to them for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">except when the world falls apart and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">because the world&#39;s falling apart and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">the very people who got to the positions</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">in political power and corporate power</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">all the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.439" style="s2">who were influencers in their generation</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">the people who were charismatic the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.439" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">who didn&#39;t go through trauma the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">who had</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">went through less and less trauma and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">then they&#39;re at the top because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">could fake it till they make it they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">there and they&#39;re like look i&#39;m the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">at being the best to be on the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s like great pandemic what do we</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">like right so maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">we should stop maybe we should stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">looking to the people in power like they</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">know what they&#39;re doing because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">they all got there by faking it till</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">on anything if i feel the opposite way</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">and those people who pretend they know</p>
