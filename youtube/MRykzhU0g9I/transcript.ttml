<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">actually without even knowing it over</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">the last number of years when I first</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">discovered you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">I was pretty late to the game I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">certainly known of Dilbert but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">really relate into it too much because</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have the corporate America</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">experience but my friend our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">friend Mike Tsarevich a while back I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">want to say it was 2016 one day he did a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">book review of your book I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">a how to fail and to keep winning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">not the right exact title but we know it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">how to fail and how to fail almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">everything I think right and I&#39;m failing</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">at that title too so and I noticed Mike</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">did a review of yours and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">just sort of start with that because</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">from my perspective as somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">been operating in the sort of right side</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">Twitter sphere that was the first time</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">that I really became aware of your work</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">outside of Dilbert and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">if if you could just sort of recap the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">way that you and Mike came together</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">because I think that that did lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">number of productive projects and things</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering what sort of influence</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">you saw that that had on on you and your</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:03.689" style="s2">experience of transforming yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">a cartoonist into a political pundit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.689" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">somebody that does commentary every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">that&#39;s viewed and watched by pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">everybody in media well I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">specific memory of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:18.599" style="s2">first contact I had with Mike Tsarevitch</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">but there are a number of people and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.599" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">would be chief among them who I&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.970" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">in the process of being on Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:30.510" style="s2">talking about you know various political</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">things so I think if I can recall I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.510" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">think he was boosting my signal in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">words he was retweeting me and talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:41.819" style="s2">about some of the some of the my tweets</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">before I had much of a following so he</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.819" end="00:02:47.459" style="s2">was one of the the biggest boosters of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">my early influence just by giving me a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.459" end="00:02:52.049" style="s2">bigger signal that I could have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.269" style="s2">on my own and and since then we&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.049" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">know I appeared in his movie hoaxed as</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.269" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">one of the interviewers and we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">lots of conversations including this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">morning on you know on Twitter so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">have a pretty much a continuous loose</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">communication even if we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">directly to each other or we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2">reading each other&#39;s tweets yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">know what was interesting to me about</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.110" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">that connection was that Mike was at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2">time writing a lot about mindset and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:21.630" style="s2">continues to do so and if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">general theme I can take away from at</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.630" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">least two of the books that I&#39;ve read of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:28.590" style="s2">yours how to fail and then also I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">read looser think a lot of it is about</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.590" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">mindset and it&#39;s about controlling your</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:34.859" style="s2">the way that you think in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">you see the world and I was wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.859" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">you have sensed an increased amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">attention or interest around this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:46.590" style="s2">particular subject matter and if so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:47.810" style="s2">may you attribute that to and if not</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:51.090" style="s2">tell me why I&#39;m crazy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.810" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">well I think part of it is that Mike&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">book is it reminded me guerrilla mindset</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">that doing well with the titles today I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">mean I think he sold over a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">thousand of those and it&#39;s it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">influential and then my book had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">failed almost everything in still when</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">big had sort of compatible you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">related stuff I didn&#39;t know it at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:18.350" style="s2">time but they they don&#39;t overlap so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">as they are compatible I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.350" end="00:04:24.770" style="s2">my book sold you know I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:26.870" style="s2">give you numbers but it sold a lot II</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.770" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">sold plenty</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.870" end="00:04:32.150" style="s2">and there both of these ideas you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:33.830" style="s2">the stuff Mike does and stuff I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.150" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">they&#39;re the kind of things that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.830" end="00:04:39.530" style="s2">have to experience by practice in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.530" style="s2">words if you if you first hear anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.530" end="00:04:43.970" style="s2">that we talk about it doesn&#39;t maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.530" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not as powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.970" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">until you observe it what working so</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of thing you can try and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">then if it works you&#39;d do more of it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:57.380" style="s2">so a few years after my book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">actually starting to crest in popularity</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.380" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">years after I came out because it takes</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">a while for people to try this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">then report on it and then other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">say what are you talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">in fact exactly like people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">listen to us today they&#39;re gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">those things and so it takes a while for</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.580" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">it to catch on did you do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">your book in Mike&#39;s book in general sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.770" style="s2">of created a market for this because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">was beginning to think that there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.770" end="00:05:25.940" style="s2">something going on with our society and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:28.430" style="s2">our culture that makes this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.940" end="00:05:30.979" style="s2">to us right now maybe identifies a need</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.430" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">that we weren&#39;t aware of or there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.979" end="00:05:36.889" style="s2">sort of you know mixed-up jumble in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">brain disconnect with reality some sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.889" end="00:05:40.669" style="s2">of dissonance that is leading people</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:43.849" style="s2">towards an interest in figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.669" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">to control the way we think and control</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.849" end="00:05:47.720" style="s2">the way that we frame information so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:49.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s more beneficial to us rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.720" end="00:05:51.050" style="s2">than negative so do you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.610" end="00:05:52.849" style="s2">creating the market and the market was</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.050" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">there is there a societal need for this</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.849" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">right now oh it&#39;s probably a little both</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:59.060" style="s2">you know the the market has to be ready</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:01.490" style="s2">for the message or else it just dies on</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.060" end="00:06:03.740" style="s2">arrival so the market was clearly ready</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.490" end="00:06:05.240" style="s2">and then on top of that you know I think</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.240" end="00:06:10.010" style="s2">very accessible you know if the average</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.789" end="00:06:12.260" style="s2">person can breeze through the making a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.010" end="00:06:14.060" style="s2">lot out of them without a lot of work so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.260" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">I think that&#39;s part of it but the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.060" end="00:06:18.260" style="s2">thing that&#39;s happening on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:21.139" style="s2">larger society societal level that may</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.260" end="00:06:24.229" style="s2">play into this is I think it is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.139" end="00:06:27.979" style="s2">obvious than it has ever been that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.229" end="00:06:29.510" style="s2">live in subjective realities and Trump</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.979" end="00:06:31.639" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t want to talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.510" end="00:06:35.659" style="s2">about drunk but he&#39;s he&#39;s clearly the</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.490" end="00:06:45.500" style="s2">living in completely different realities</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:46.460" style="s2">some people are living in a some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.500" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">a horror movie</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.460" end="00:06:50.750" style="s2">in which everything&#39;s gonna blow up any</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.789" end="00:06:56.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just because it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">for some people it&#39;s worse for others</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.270" end="00:07:00.349" style="s2">it&#39;s really the same kind of people they</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:03.080" style="s2">just happen to have different political</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.349" end="00:07:05.000" style="s2">views some see it as a tragedy and some</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.080" end="00:07:09.530" style="s2">see it as a comedy but they can both</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.000" end="00:07:11.389" style="s2">survive and reproduce and work so one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.530" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">the things where we&#39;re all learning at</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.389" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">the same time and that&#39;s what I write</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:18.470" style="s2">about is that you&#39;re not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:20.389" style="s2">world the way other people are you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.470" end="00:07:22.009" style="s2">just not experiencing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.389" end="00:07:24.139" style="s2">they are and for all practical purposes</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.009" end="00:07:27.080" style="s2">you live in your own subjective world</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.139" end="00:07:30.409" style="s2">now that&#39;s independent of whether there</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.080" end="00:07:31.729" style="s2">is a is a truth below that we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.409" end="00:07:33.889" style="s2">we don&#39;t even have to get to that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.729" end="00:07:37.340" style="s2">only thing we we know for sure is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.889" end="00:07:40.099" style="s2">we don&#39;t have access to it as humans so</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.340" end="00:07:41.810" style="s2">that that&#39;s an interesting point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.099" end="00:07:44.509" style="s2">sort of headed off my next question at</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.810" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">the pass a little bit my last recording</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.509" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">I did was with an artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">intelligence expert PhD from MIT he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.070" style="s2">worked in the field for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:54.320" style="s2">years his name is Nick cause Madison</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.070" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna be I&#39;ll probably release his</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.320" end="00:07:59.150" style="s2">a little bit before this one and I asked</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:02.090" style="s2">him a question about you know computers</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.150" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">and their ability to you know perceived</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.090" end="00:08:06.830" style="s2">the world visually and whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:09.050" style="s2">that was going to lead us to conclude</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.830" end="00:08:12.650" style="s2">that there was an actual concrete</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.050" end="00:08:14.389" style="s2">objective reality that you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.650" end="00:08:15.889" style="s2">point to and say yeah that rock is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.389" end="00:08:17.300" style="s2">rock and that&#39;s all the things to it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.889" end="00:08:18.440" style="s2">look these computers from my very</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.300" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">different angle are seeing it the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.440" end="00:08:22.460" style="s2">way too would that at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.650" style="s2">to you know sort of definitively show us</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.460" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">that there is an objective reality so</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.650" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">that&#39;s my question to you on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.870" style="s2">subject and then I guess I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:33.229" style="s2">already told me that it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.870" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">but well it might be true that all</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.229" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">robots have the same subjective reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.620" style="s2">I mean I can see that because you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">program them they&#39;d act they&#39;d act in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.620" end="00:08:44.270" style="s2">predictable way but if you said okay now</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">let&#39;s take my robot my artificial</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.270" end="00:08:49.010" style="s2">intelligence and have it talk to the two</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">of us who disagree on the reality it</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.010" end="00:08:53.209" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work you know even even if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:54.140" style="s2">totally trusted that the robot was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.209" end="00:08:56.570" style="s2">seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.140" end="00:08:59.660" style="s2">realistically you&#39;d still think this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.570" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">robot was broken if it disagreed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.660" end="00:09:04.010" style="s2">like well I see what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.780" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure this robots defective</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.010" end="00:09:08.360" style="s2">because that&#39;s not what I&#39;m seeing so</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.780" end="00:09:11.180" style="s2">bee people don&#39;t really easily change</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.360" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">their minds about reality itself but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.180" end="00:09:15.860" style="s2">really I&#39;m talking about interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:17.720" style="s2">of reality not not the question of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.860" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">whether a rock is there or not there we</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.720" end="00:09:23.660" style="s2">we generally agree on what the rock is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:25.820" style="s2">there or not there right do you how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.660" end="00:09:27.860" style="s2">do you think our perceptions of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.820" end="00:09:31.160" style="s2">objective reality and our own subjective</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.860" end="00:09:34.060" style="s2">reality then is influenced by our sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.160" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">of our DNA and sort of a biological</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.060" end="00:09:39.560" style="s2">determinism because in your writing I</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:41.660" style="s2">definitely get the sense that you I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:43.310" style="s2">very explicitly say that the information</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.660" end="00:09:45.860" style="s2">that we absorb in the language that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.310" end="00:09:49.730" style="s2">use the language that we&#39;re given help</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.860" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">shape our own reality but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.730" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">time I also struggle with the notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.730" style="s2">that you know for example you know can</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">men and women just switch their genders</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.730" end="00:09:58.790" style="s2">and their sexuality is on a whim I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:00.650" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.790" end="00:10:02.780" style="s2">do believe that there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.650" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">our gender expression masculinity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">tied to our biology and to who we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:11.090" style="s2">chemically you know etc and so to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">extent are those forces working together</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.090" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">in opposition which one is stronger what</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:20.090" style="s2">do I need to rely on more do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:22.250" style="s2">rely on I&#39;m changing the inputs that go</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.090" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">into my head or maximizing the outputs</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.250" end="00:10:26.870" style="s2">that come out of my DNA what do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:29.750" style="s2">think about that well in my how to fail</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.870" end="00:10:34.340" style="s2">book I talk about humans as being moist</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.750" end="00:10:36.500" style="s2">robots in other words the the common way</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.340" end="00:10:38.180" style="s2">that people imagine themselves and other</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.500" end="00:10:40.610" style="s2">people is that you have thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.180" end="00:10:43.430" style="s2">then those thoughts translate into your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.610" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">actions and and certainly that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.430" end="00:10:49.100" style="s2">know true ish that that does happen but</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:50.750" style="s2">the hypnotist view and I&#39;m a trained</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.100" end="00:10:53.630" style="s2">hypnotist and when you learn the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.750" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">hypnosis you you learn that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.630" end="00:10:59.270" style="s2">backwards or upside down if you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">and that what really happens is our body</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.270" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">is informing our brain what to think so</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:06.620" style="s2">you can see that easily if you&#39;re let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:08.190" style="s2">say you have kids and your kids are</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.620" end="00:11:10.020" style="s2">tired or hung</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.190" end="00:11:12.180" style="s2">you know they start fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.020" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">complaining and yelling and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">get him to do anything and then you feed</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:18.900" style="s2">him a hot dog and then suddenly they</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:20.850" style="s2">stop complaining they clean up their</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.900" end="00:11:22.470" style="s2">room and the first time somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.850" end="00:11:24.090" style="s2">explained that to his it was my ex-wife</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">she said no they&#39;re just hungry</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.090" end="00:11:27.750" style="s2">and I would look at them and say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:30.090" style="s2">not just hungry there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.750" end="00:11:32.490" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.090" end="00:11:33.870" style="s2">deeply disturbing with these children</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.490" end="00:11:36.180" style="s2">and then you feed them and then they</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.870" end="00:11:37.980" style="s2">become normal immediately now of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.180" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">as an adult you&#39;ve had that experience a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.980" end="00:11:41.970" style="s2">million times</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:44.370" style="s2">you know that if depending on your state</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.970" end="00:11:47.430" style="s2">of mind the world can look like a horror</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.370" end="00:11:50.220" style="s2">or a delight and and once you learn that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.430" end="00:11:52.440" style="s2">if you get your body right if you take</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.220" end="00:11:55.290" style="s2">care of your health your your stress</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.440" end="00:11:56.670" style="s2">especially you know get to sleep diet</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.290" end="00:11:58.860" style="s2">exercise if you get that stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.670" end="00:12:01.410" style="s2">then your brain starts working the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.860" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">you think you should have before but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.410" end="00:12:05.160" style="s2">but if you just start with the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:07.710" style="s2">said let me let me think my way out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.160" end="00:12:10.830" style="s2">these bad thoughts that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.710" end="00:12:12.570" style="s2">tough one yeah interesting so if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.830" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">took two people who are watching them</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.570" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">the screen and seeing two different</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:18.360" style="s2">movies and you feed them properly train</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">them properly exercise them give them</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.360" end="00:12:21.240" style="s2">enough sleep make them as comfortable as</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.240" end="00:12:24.600" style="s2">is that gonna get them closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">same movie or are they still gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.600" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">seeing two different movies if you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:29.670" style="s2">optimize yourself you&#39;re still going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:31.320" style="s2">have those differences yeah you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.670" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">look at have those differences the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.320" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">difference in that example you gave me</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:37.800" style="s2">is it&#39;s people watching the scary movie</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:40.460" style="s2">it might be less scared yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.800" end="00:12:43.320" style="s2">yeah because if your body is physically</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.460" end="00:12:46.910" style="s2">in good shape you can handle stress</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.320" end="00:12:50.130" style="s2">better so so that would only be a minor</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:51.900" style="s2">correlation there is it possible to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.130" end="00:12:55.950" style="s2">people to watch a different movie</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.900" end="00:13:01.380" style="s2">I hear people who say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.950" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">changed them so I asked after the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.380" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:07.740" style="s2">I did a tweet and which I asked people</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2">if anything I had done had changed their</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.740" end="00:13:13.470" style="s2">vote or their opinion about Trump as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.500" end="00:13:16.350" style="s2">candidate and I think something like if</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.470" end="00:13:18.600" style="s2">I recall 1500 people told me that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.350" end="00:13:21.030" style="s2">changed their entire political view</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.600" end="00:13:21.870" style="s2">because of watching me now that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.030" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">how many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.870" end="00:13:27.779" style="s2">fondant brain so you can usually you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:29.820" style="s2">know ten times that at the minimum okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.779" end="00:13:31.320" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know maybe maybe fifty</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.820" end="00:13:34.020" style="s2">hundred thousand people changed their</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.320" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">views after watching me but there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.020" end="00:13:38.670" style="s2">probably people who did not have</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.710" style="s2">super-hardened views so the people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.670" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">said you know let&#39;s say they were</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.710" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">conservative to begin with and their</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">first impression of Trump was negative</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">well they were still conservatives and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:53.250" style="s2">he was still promoting conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:55.890" style="s2">views so it wasn&#39;t that big of a leap to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.250" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">go from you know being conservative to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.890" end="00:13:59.910" style="s2">embracing Trump it would be really hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:03.960" style="s2">to change somebody from Democrat to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.910" end="00:14:04.770" style="s2">Republican or vice versa ain&#39;t changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.960" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">demo</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.770" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">hey everybody that&#39;s my dog Rosie hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.470" end="00:14:12.900" style="s2">Rosie my podcast listeners an audience</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">deaf whoa Rosie and just so happens the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.900" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">mailman decided to come right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:19.110" style="s2">we&#39;re recording so Rosie thank you honey</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:20.460" style="s2">I&#39;ll probably edit this part out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.110" end="00:14:23.310" style="s2">usually I did anything but maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.460" end="00:14:25.620" style="s2">part so that brings me to another</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.310" end="00:14:27.959" style="s2">question is so if people well first of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.620" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">all Democrats a deplorable is kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.959" end="00:14:32.850" style="s2">whole shtick so if that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:35.100" style="s2">my main focus has been on on myself I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.850" end="00:14:37.290" style="s2">went through a process of abandoning the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.100" end="00:14:39.720" style="s2">Democratic Party I voted for Obama two</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.290" end="00:14:41.910" style="s2">times I probably voted for Clinton if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.720" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">can remember I never ever voted</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.910" end="00:14:46.620" style="s2">Republican knowing my family ever voted</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">Republican but 2016 was was a time in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.620" end="00:14:49.500" style="s2">which I realized that the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:52.589" style="s2">Party had definitely moved away from me</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.500" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">and that the the the new Republican</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.589" end="00:14:56.640" style="s2">Party as embodied by Trump and some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">other elements to it were appealing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.640" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">me and so maybe you know maybe I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:02.550" style="s2">really change the party has changed I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:06.209" style="s2">think that that&#39;s one one reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.550" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">example but if we are destined to watch</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.209" end="00:15:11.100" style="s2">two different movies and in doing so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:14.070" style="s2">watching those two different movies</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.100" end="00:15:17.610" style="s2">leads us to conflict or when I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.070" end="00:15:19.740" style="s2">what what are the consequences of having</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.610" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">a nation that can observe the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.740" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">and come away with to almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">terrifyingly different conclusions well</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s not new so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">if you if you look at the super big</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">picture or the course of evolution over</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:35.850" style="s2">the the life of the earth look at all</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:38.100" style="s2">the animals who</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.850" end="00:15:40.470" style="s2">don&#39;t understand their reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.100" end="00:15:42.509" style="s2">does a clam understand this reality does</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.470" end="00:15:43.889" style="s2">your dog understand its reality really I</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.509" end="00:15:46.440" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t know that the mailman is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.889" end="00:15:48.389" style="s2">delivering mail just just thinks it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.440" end="00:15:51.569" style="s2">intruder or something right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.389" end="00:15:52.769" style="s2">apparently and and I think we can say</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.569" end="00:15:55.589" style="s2">this safely because they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.769" end="00:15:58.529" style="s2">literally what tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.589" end="00:15:59.819" style="s2">examples and no counter examples we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.529" end="00:16:01.380" style="s2">see all these creatures who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.819" end="00:16:03.000" style="s2">understand their reality they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.380" end="00:16:06.269" style="s2">humans but they don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.000" end="00:16:07.709" style="s2">and yet they could reproduce they they</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.269" end="00:16:09.329" style="s2">have everything they need there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.709" end="00:16:09.810" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing lacking if they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.329" end="00:16:12.360" style="s2">reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.810" end="00:16:15.630" style="s2">that&#39;s all evolution demands of you so</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.360" end="00:16:17.579" style="s2">what are the odds that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.630" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">evolved to finally get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.579" end="00:16:21.779" style="s2">where they understand their reality and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">you were lucky enough to be here for it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.779" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">I mean 15 billion years of since the Big</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:32.339" style="s2">Bang and how lucky that this little you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:34.350" style="s2">know hundred year period you just happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.339" end="00:16:36.899" style="s2">to be born when we figured it all out so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.350" end="00:16:40.620" style="s2">I take it as given that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.899" end="00:16:43.709" style="s2">understand a reality but the the the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.620" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">moviepro thing is not that different</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.709" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">from a lot of things we see that work</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:51.149" style="s2">for example capitalism is you know buyer</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:53.880" style="s2">and a seller each you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.149" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">it over on the other one it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.880" end="00:16:58.230" style="s2">they&#39;re probably nine entertain ten</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:17:00.540" style="s2">things fail in capitalism and yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.230" end="00:17:04.350" style="s2">capitalism works even though it&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.540" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">built around primarily failing nine and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.350" end="00:17:09.030" style="s2">ten businesses that&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2">failure rate and if you look at voting</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.030" end="00:17:15.449" style="s2">and cap and democracy you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:19.350" style="s2">democratic systems republic etc it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.449" end="00:17:22.890" style="s2">full of conflict and lying and and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.350" end="00:17:26.220" style="s2">fake news and it seems like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.890" end="00:17:28.679" style="s2">this big cauldron of violent and evil</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.220" end="00:17:31.049" style="s2">and then we wake up in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.679" end="00:17:33.990" style="s2">we have the strongest economy you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.049" end="00:17:38.510" style="s2">super capable military we&#39;re safer than</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.990" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever been and i&#39;d have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.510" end="00:17:45.320" style="s2">the the conflict that we see is largely</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:48.630" style="s2">a theatrical construct meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.320" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">because politics is now our new form of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.630" end="00:17:52.380" style="s2">entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">and the whole world is watching you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.380" end="00:17:58.919" style="s2">essentially the exaggerated a hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.640" end="00:18:00.870" style="s2">theatrical version of reality and people</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.919" end="00:18:02.970" style="s2">you know as a lifestyle they buy into</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.870" end="00:18:04.740" style="s2">one version or another but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.970" end="00:18:07.020" style="s2">something about the way the system is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.740" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">designed let&#39;s give all credit to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.020" end="00:18:10.950" style="s2">founders who came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:13.890" style="s2">Constitution and yeah we&#39;ve tweaked it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.950" end="00:18:16.049" style="s2">over time but if somehow handles all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:18.330" style="s2">that conflict all of that stupidity all</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.049" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">of that selfishness all of that fake</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.330" end="00:18:24.870" style="s2">news all about lying and produces the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">Golden Age and we&#39;re at a point where</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.870" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">humans have never looked at a better</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">situation than we&#39;re looking at right</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:34.860" style="s2">now absolutely so apparently it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:37.289" style="s2">problem that needs to be solved because</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.860" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">think them at the the big picture is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.289" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">things improve basically every year yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:46.740" style="s2">you know that is a perspective I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:49.740" style="s2">that comes with age when I have these</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.740" end="00:18:51.960" style="s2">conversations with my mother no I&#39;m 44</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.740" end="00:18:53.789" style="s2">so I&#39;m not young but when I have these</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.960" end="00:18:56.549" style="s2">questions with my mom she always takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.789" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">those like 10 steps back and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.549" end="00:18:59.429" style="s2">I has just been like that forever and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:01.020" style="s2">look where we are now everything&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.429" end="00:19:03.750" style="s2">be just fine don&#39;t you worry about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.020" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2">but then you know you get focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.750" end="00:19:08.549" style="s2">minutia and you and you experience like</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:11.130" style="s2">for example I went to the Richmond</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.549" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">Second Amendment gun rally on January</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.130" end="00:19:16.260" style="s2">20th and while I was there</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:18.570" style="s2">everyone was super nice there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.260" end="00:19:20.280" style="s2">variety of different people diverse</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.570" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">groups of people were there everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.280" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">had their guns out it was like it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">like one one-hundredth of rowdy as any</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:29.010" style="s2">NFL football game you&#39;ve ever been to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.950" style="s2">and it was just like a really lovely</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.010" end="00:19:33.630" style="s2">pleasant day and then the news reports</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.950" end="00:19:35.460" style="s2">that came out of it were just like look</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.630" end="00:19:37.020" style="s2">at all these racists with their guns</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.460" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">what if there were black people there</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.020" end="00:19:39.750" style="s2">with guns what would happen then well</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:41.490" style="s2">guess what there were and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:43.530" style="s2">and they took pictures with them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.490" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">everybody was super cool and nice and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.530" end="00:19:48.750" style="s2">I left that experience which I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">number of times my own personal life</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.750" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">being called a Nazi and getting fired</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:54.900" style="s2">for it even though I was and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:58.169" style="s2">obviously and each of these times they</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.900" end="00:20:00.100" style="s2">still it still managed to cause us</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.169" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">really severe</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.100" end="00:20:05.799" style="s2">just I get incensed though a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">it really agitated because I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.799" end="00:20:10.570" style="s2">there&#39;s something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">resolved we need to be able to see facts</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.570" end="00:20:15.400" style="s2">and and things the same way so that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.630" style="s2">can come together we can do happy but</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.400" end="00:20:19.179" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.630" end="00:20:21.730" style="s2">I&#39;m saying yeah you&#39;re saying no no I</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.179" end="00:20:24.190" style="s2">they&#39;re all evidence suggests that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.730" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">don&#39;t need to agree on reality because</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.190" end="00:20:29.140" style="s2">we have you know thousands of years of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:31.330" style="s2">civilization in which we haven&#39;t and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.140" end="00:20:33.549" style="s2">got this far I mean we made it this far</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.330" end="00:20:35.260" style="s2">with all of those flaws and it made no</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.549" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">difference at all now do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.260" end="00:20:39.460" style="s2">perhaps these circumstances are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:41.620" style="s2">different given the prevalence of social</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.460" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">media and technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.620" end="00:20:48.610" style="s2">I read her Aires or Harvey sapiens book</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:50.830" style="s2">and in there he talks about how our</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.610" end="00:20:53.590" style="s2">societies coalesced around him shared</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.830" end="00:20:55.750" style="s2">imagined orders and then I read a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">of technologists and and and media</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.750" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">specialists today that talk about how in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:02.890" style="s2">the old days we had a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:04.539" style="s2">information distribution system where</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.890" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">Walter Cronkite would tell us all what</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.539" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">to think and feel at night and we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.070" end="00:21:10.690" style="s2">all unified and we had cohesion today</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:13.210" style="s2">now because of the liberation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:14.950" style="s2">communication via technology we are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.210" end="00:21:16.539" style="s2">talking one-to-many we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.950" end="00:21:19.000" style="s2">many-to-many and therefore there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.539" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">million different imagine orders and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.000" end="00:21:22.270" style="s2">we don&#39;t share in those imagined orders</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:23.980" style="s2">in the way that we did and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.270" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">we&#39;re now seeing a breakdown in social</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.980" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">cohesion well any weight to that well I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:32.919" style="s2">would modify that by saying that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">two dominant at least political views</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.919" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:39.570" style="s2">and I&#39;ve always said that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:42.250" style="s2">form political opinions on their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.570" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">opinions are assigned to them by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.250" end="00:21:47.770" style="s2">dominant media now if you ask somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:50.440" style="s2">they say well it&#39;s my opinion but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.770" end="00:21:54.010" style="s2">the tell it always matches their</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.440" end="00:21:56.110" style="s2">preferred news source always so you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.010" end="00:21:59.289" style="s2">you could take almost any negative story</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.110" end="00:22:01.809" style="s2">about Trump and say okay let&#39;s just try</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.289" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">to imagine that this had been reported</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.809" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">as just the facts with no opinion</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:06.789" style="s2">layered on what would you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">and you would find that almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.789" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">everything that&#39;s alarming and scary and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:13.890" style="s2">you know completely inappropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">everything else about</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.890" end="00:22:17.790" style="s2">whatever whatever complaint they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:20.220" style="s2">bringing today you would find that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.790" end="00:22:22.190" style="s2">almost all of it would just go away if</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.220" end="00:22:24.330" style="s2">all you did is describe what he did</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.190" end="00:22:27.030" style="s2">instead of having the pundits come on</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.330" end="00:22:29.730" style="s2">say well what he was thinking or or</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.030" end="00:22:32.550" style="s2">where this will lead us to or what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.730" end="00:22:34.530" style="s2">really means but didn&#39;t say it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.550" end="00:22:36.990" style="s2">that stuff they divides us it&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.530" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">he actually does right but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.990" end="00:22:41.640" style="s2">this in this argument people were</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:43.590" style="s2">talking about how it&#39;s not even dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.640" end="00:22:46.680" style="s2">news media that are creating new</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.590" end="00:22:47.970" style="s2">narratives for us for example our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.680" end="00:22:49.620" style="s2">friend Mike Serna Mitch he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.970" end="00:22:51.030" style="s2">successful at creating made media</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.620" end="00:22:52.920" style="s2">narratives and they of course spread</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.030" end="00:22:55.020" style="s2">into larger institutions and then people</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.920" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">get it from there but there is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.020" end="00:22:59.000" style="s2">element now I think of a you know we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">were sort of like in a unipolar</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.000" end="00:23:02.820" style="s2">communication world and now we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:04.530" style="s2">this multipolar world where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.820" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">talking and there&#39;s nodes everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.530" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">I I just wonder if it&#39;s not so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:12.660" style="s2">dismiss this notion that failing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:15.750" style="s2">maintain a shared imagined world order</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.660" end="00:23:17.460" style="s2">or shared ideas of who we are in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.750" end="00:23:19.260" style="s2">head because in America at least we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.460" end="00:23:22.200" style="s2">very much our identity is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.260" end="00:23:24.900" style="s2">shared idea rather than shared genetics</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.200" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">or shared bloodlines that in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.900" end="00:23:29.460" style="s2">particular case especially since our</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:33.030" style="s2">nation is one of ideas that if these</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.460" end="00:23:34.860" style="s2">ideas are now multiple and diverse and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.030" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">coming at you from all directions and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.860" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">able to recruit you into smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:41.370" style="s2">smaller teams that they met that may</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">have a long-term negative effect on</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.370" end="00:23:46.350" style="s2">social cohesion that we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.790" style="s2">been seen before or or positive because</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.350" end="00:23:51.690" style="s2">all this stuff is completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.790" end="00:23:55.050" style="s2">unpredictable but what I say what I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.690" end="00:23:56.970" style="s2">is it seems like it used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.050" end="00:24:00.180" style="s2">question of you know you got your</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.970" end="00:24:01.800" style="s2">Democrats against your Republicans then</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.180" end="00:24:04.680" style="s2">of course you had the media that was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.800" end="00:24:07.560" style="s2">big player but I think things because of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.680" end="00:24:10.050" style="s2">social media we now see a battle that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.560" end="00:24:12.780" style="s2">seems to be shaping up between two sides</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.050" end="00:24:15.960" style="s2">one that has money and the other has</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.780" end="00:24:17.940" style="s2">influence now now that you know both</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.960" end="00:24:20.760" style="s2">sides have both some money and some</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.940" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">influence etc but people who were</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.760" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">skilled at influence you know they</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:27.160" style="s2">actually have the tools to influence and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:31.270" style="s2">make sort of itches one I&#39;m another</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.160" end="00:24:33.789" style="s2">if we have a big enough audience we</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.270" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2">become the people who create that shared</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.789" end="00:24:37.660" style="s2">imagination you know I I don&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:39.700" style="s2">me personally but people were</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.660" end="00:24:42.309" style="s2">influential enough to have big audiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.700" end="00:24:43.900" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re good with words and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.309" end="00:24:46.360" style="s2">they understand persuasion so they can</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">one of the finest gentlemen that I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.740" end="00:25:45.880" style="s2">met period in life and I have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:47.799" style="s2">but great things to say about Jack he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.880" end="00:25:49.419" style="s2">just a good man a family man his wife is</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.210" end="00:25:59.770" style="s2">you&#39;re right he can fire things out at</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.159" end="00:26:01.690" style="s2">will and generate massive interest and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.770" end="00:26:05.260" style="s2">spread stories and create narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.690" end="00:26:07.659" style="s2">actually control the legacy media as if</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.260" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">they were on the end of a string and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.659" end="00:26:12.309" style="s2">wonder to what extent that that reads</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:15.309" style="s2">that I mean they had the the legacy</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.309" end="00:26:18.940" style="s2">media hates you guys and and and and how</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.309" end="00:26:21.490" style="s2">much of that is out of jealousy or fear</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.940" end="00:26:23.140" style="s2">and and I want to circle back later to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.490" end="00:26:24.610" style="s2">this idea of fear I feel like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.140" end="00:26:27.490" style="s2">us are motivated we&#39;re all motivated</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.610" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">seemingly by fear and so to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.490" end="00:26:34.390" style="s2">is there backlash based on fear or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:35.620" style="s2">jealousy and if so and talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.390" end="00:26:39.070" style="s2">about making predictions this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.620" end="00:26:41.110" style="s2">be fun but so how does that play out</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.070" end="00:26:43.450" style="s2">over five or ten years if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.110" end="00:26:46.990" style="s2">continue on a trajectory slippery slope</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.450" end="00:26:49.210" style="s2">just kidding a trajectory like this what</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.990" end="00:26:52.179" style="s2">is that what what could happen when</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.210" end="00:26:54.940" style="s2">people with money see their influence</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.179" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">slipping they don&#39;t like that well</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.940" end="00:26:58.150" style="s2">they&#39;ll probably try to hire that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:26:59.920" style="s2">who have influence so I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.150" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re gonna try to buy whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.920" end="00:27:04.540" style="s2">is working for the other team because</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.200" end="00:27:07.179" style="s2">they can but they&#39;re gonna have to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.540" end="00:27:09.340" style="s2">people who were not as independent as</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.179" end="00:27:10.809" style="s2">the three people you just mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.340" end="00:27:13.720" style="s2">know what one of the things that gives</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.809" end="00:27:15.940" style="s2">me a superpower if you will and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.720" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2">itch as well is that we&#39;re gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.940" end="00:27:21.250" style="s2">things that we think are true even if</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.150" end="00:27:22.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t like them and we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:25.030" style="s2">worry too much about what that does to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.600" end="00:27:27.160" style="s2">our career in my case you know my career</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.030" end="00:27:30.429" style="s2">earnings when you know down about 30 or</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.160" end="00:27:32.650" style="s2">40 percent just by talking about Trump I</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.429" end="00:27:34.750" style="s2">can&#39;t do speeches anymore that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.650" end="00:27:36.130" style="s2">huge part of my revenue I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.750" end="00:27:38.140" style="s2">licensing any more it would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.130" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">impossible to do a Dilbert movie if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.140" end="00:27:41.380" style="s2">tried to do that today because it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">there would be too many people would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.380" end="00:27:45.190" style="s2">hey that guy said something good about</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.980" style="s2">Trump that one time now I&#39;ve also said</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.190" end="00:27:51.130" style="s2">lots of criticisms but but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.980" end="00:27:55.780" style="s2">remember that they&#39;ll always see me as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.130" end="00:27:58.030" style="s2">team so it&#39;s expensive and only the only</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.780" end="00:28:00.340" style="s2">people can do it are the people who work</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.030" end="00:28:04.630" style="s2">for themselves or find some way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.340" end="00:28:07.390" style="s2">monetize the the danger right right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.630" end="00:28:09.880" style="s2">if you can&#39;t monetize the danger which I</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.390" end="00:28:11.650" style="s2">have learned to to some degree given my</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.880" end="00:28:13.090" style="s2">experience with the boxing I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.650" end="00:28:15.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know - they sent that you know but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.090" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">I was totally doxxed I had a pen name</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.400" end="00:28:19.510" style="s2">totally docks my aunt Eva called me of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.530" end="00:28:20.980" style="s2">Nazi got me fired from my job banned</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.510" end="00:28:22.900" style="s2">from coaching Little League basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:24.970" style="s2">stripped away my entire life and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.900" end="00:28:26.830" style="s2">identity my whole resume grad school</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.970" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">career everything up and smoked total</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">ashes you said your revenue went down</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">saw mine went to zero went completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:37.090" style="s2">zero and I had this sort of jujitsu it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">all into something productive and and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.090" end="00:28:41.320" style="s2">have been able to do that but not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">people who are gonna be best at that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:47.890" style="s2">game aren&#39;t gonna aren&#39;t gonna sell out</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">so I wonder to what extent if you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.890" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">or the independent sort of pirate outlaw</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:28:56.679" style="s2">in the Bronze Age pervert lingo</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:58.630" style="s2">continues to gather strength you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.679" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">power plays that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.630" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">history is all about right big big power</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:05.860" style="s2">plays and struggle for power I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">how it plays out five to ten years the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.860" end="00:29:10.330" style="s2">interesting same well there&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:12.850" style="s2">said there&#39;s a new player in the past</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.330" end="00:29:15.669" style="s2">you could be a really influential person</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.850" end="00:29:17.049" style="s2">but if you didn&#39;t have a platform nobody</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.669" end="00:29:19.240" style="s2">cared because you couldn&#39;t get your</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.049" end="00:29:21.610" style="s2">message him or in the past you might</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.240" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">have a big platform but you didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.610" end="00:29:25.179" style="s2">that the skill of persuasion you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.669" style="s2">know it was something you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.179" end="00:29:31.179" style="s2">learn and get better at but now you got</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.669" end="00:29:34.330" style="s2">both so so it&#39;s almost like a warlord</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.179" end="00:29:36.130" style="s2">situation where people are bringing you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.330" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">know a million people with them on</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.130" end="00:29:40.899" style="s2">whatever ride they want to take them and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:44.620" style="s2">if they&#39;re good at giving rides that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.899" end="00:29:47.110" style="s2">that numbers gonna grow yeah fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.620" end="00:29:49.690" style="s2">yeah it warlord is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.110" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">language to use Bronze Age pervert uses</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.690" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">like outlaws and pirates and he uses</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.649" style="s2">imagery of you know like marauding</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:59.350" style="s2">pirates you know traveling the globe</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.649" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">taking over things and it&#39;s all image or</p>

<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:06.789" style="s2">mine better because the warlord assumes</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.990" end="00:30:08.529" style="s2">that it&#39;s one person who&#39;s collected an</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.789" end="00:30:10.149" style="s2">army yeah and that and that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.060" end="00:31:08.110" style="s2">and it&#39;s there where the real influence</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.310" end="00:31:09.460" style="s2">is happening the real impacts happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.110" end="00:31:10.840" style="s2">because those guys are actually changing</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.460" end="00:31:12.250" style="s2">their lives and taking steps and</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.820" end="00:31:19.810" style="s2">you build sort of a long-term response</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.010" end="00:31:22.630" style="s2">to whatever cultural problems you may</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.810" end="00:31:26.010" style="s2">see out there but it is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.630" end="00:31:29.710" style="s2">interesting to see what happens you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.010" end="00:31:32.440" style="s2">an environment full of warlords is in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.710" end="00:31:33.580" style="s2">steady state right like that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.440" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">last forever</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.580" end="00:31:39.160" style="s2">or or is it because like I said in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:41.380" style="s2">earlier examples you know capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.160" end="00:31:44.050" style="s2">a bunch of robber barons and selfish</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.380" end="00:31:46.870" style="s2">people many jerks and you know Crooks</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.050" end="00:31:48.670" style="s2">and Liars and yeah just the worst people</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.870" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">in the world but if your system is built</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.670" end="00:31:55.870" style="s2">right it produces gold so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:57.970" style="s2">they&#39;re having all these these warlords</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.870" end="00:32:00.550" style="s2">with different you know idea sets I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.970" end="00:32:03.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that&#39;s bad because good</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.550" end="00:32:07.300" style="s2">ideas tend to win now if I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.820" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">myself a warlord in this in this context</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.300" end="00:32:12.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean it the bad way because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.680" style="s2">know I wake up every day I already made</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.790" end="00:32:18.430" style="s2">my money and tried to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.680" end="00:32:20.260" style="s2">something to to society and I work very</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.430" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">hard and making sure that what I do has</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.260" end="00:32:26.920" style="s2">a you know a real world you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:30.100" style="s2">individual and collective benefit and as</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.920" end="00:32:31.720" style="s2">we talked earlier a lot of my ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.100" end="00:32:34.270" style="s2">bubbled up and become part of society</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.720" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">you know the the idea of talent stacks</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.270" end="00:32:40.030" style="s2">the idea of systems being better than</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:43.300" style="s2">goals those have always existed in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.030" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">form but by by capturing them in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.300" end="00:32:50.020" style="s2">really digestible approachable</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:51.790" style="s2">accessible form I was able to popularize</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.020" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">them in a way that maybe somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.790" end="00:32:56.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t have persuasion and writing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:58.570" style="s2">skills could not have so that those</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.050" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">those are two examples of ideas that go</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.570" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">you know they leave me and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:05.170" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting in the world of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:08.170" style="s2">and if they win it&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.170" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">deserved it yeah well those two ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.170" end="00:33:13.540" style="s2">particular really had an influence on me</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:15.210" style="s2">and it makes metalitz a king in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.540" end="00:33:17.669" style="s2">particular makes a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.210" end="00:33:19.979" style="s2">the sort of innate desire I have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.669" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">learning things seem more productive</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.979" end="00:33:25.249" style="s2">than it may have been before and it also</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:28.259" style="s2">makes learning things which seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.249" end="00:33:30.299" style="s2">inconsequential or manual or slightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.259" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">technical or detailed makes them all</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.299" end="00:33:34.019" style="s2">seem much more important too because the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:35.549" style="s2">more you continue to add as you know to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.019" end="00:33:37.769" style="s2">the stack the more opportunities you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.549" end="00:33:40.889" style="s2">have like for example for me I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.769" end="00:33:42.719" style="s2">I&#39;m rising out of the din of people on</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.889" end="00:33:44.639" style="s2">social media because I actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.719" end="00:33:46.919" style="s2">background that involves economics and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.639" end="00:33:48.809" style="s2">Finance and public policy and I&#39;ve run</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.919" end="00:33:50.759" style="s2">companies and I&#39;ve developed real estate</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.809" end="00:33:51.749" style="s2">and I&#39;ve written books I&#39;ve done podcast</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.759" end="00:33:54.299" style="s2">you just start to add them all up</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.749" end="00:33:56.369" style="s2">together and then you have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.299" end="00:33:57.719" style="s2">perspective that other people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.369" end="00:33:59.729" style="s2">like I can&#39;t tell you the number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.719" end="00:34:02.249" style="s2">times I&#39;ve had to engage when I worked</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.729" end="00:34:04.259" style="s2">in public policy I ran charter schools</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.249" end="00:34:06.539" style="s2">so I ran charter schools for ten years</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.259" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">as executive director but I came to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.539" end="00:34:09.809" style="s2">from real estate perspective an</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:11.549" style="s2">entrepreneurial background I just cannot</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.809" end="00:34:13.710" style="s2">tell you the number of times that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.549" end="00:34:15.299" style="s2">would be sitting there talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.710" end="00:34:17.010" style="s2">who are running multi-million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.299" end="00:34:20.129" style="s2">organizations that have absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.010" end="00:34:21.419" style="s2">idea how to run multi core organizations</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.129" end="00:34:22.980" style="s2">because all they ever did was work in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.419" end="00:34:24.389" style="s2">education all they ever did was work in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.980" end="00:34:25.649" style="s2">education they just moved over in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.389" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">education and all of a sudden they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.649" end="00:34:30.089" style="s2">trying to run these businesses and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:31.319" style="s2">really can&#39;t but the talent stack made</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.089" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">it something a little bit more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.319" end="00:34:34.740" style="s2">for me and it&#39;s also something that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:37.260" style="s2">know a lot of guys are really grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.740" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">on to and just continuing to enhance and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.260" end="00:34:41.220" style="s2">and further it&#39;s sort of the being an</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">autodidact and teaching yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.220" end="00:34:44.490" style="s2">expanding your capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:46.679" style="s2">eventually they all just line up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.490" end="00:34:49.579" style="s2">cross up into something that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.679" end="00:34:51.720" style="s2">unique and and in this world and in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.579" end="00:34:54.539" style="s2">information environment being unique is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.720" end="00:34:56.730" style="s2">is key and also key is getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.539" end="00:34:59.849" style="s2">discovered I was having this</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.730" end="00:35:02.819" style="s2">conversation the other day and people</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.849" end="00:35:04.559" style="s2">ask me all the time how can I get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.819" end="00:35:07.470" style="s2">where you are or how can I write or how</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.559" end="00:35:10.250" style="s2">can I do this and and I tell them like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.470" end="00:35:14.609" style="s2">being discovered is the hardest part</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.250" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">everybody has a platform now but you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.609" end="00:35:18.059" style="s2">even have great content but getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:20.250" style="s2">discovered is very difficult and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.059" end="00:35:22.799" style="s2">explained my idea was you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.250" end="00:35:24.599" style="s2">sort of high variance in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.799" end="00:35:26.039" style="s2">discovered what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.599" end="00:35:28.710" style="s2">what advice would you give to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.039" end="00:35:31.349" style="s2">who&#39;s got talent and a platform</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:33.930" style="s2">but nobody&#39;s listening well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.349" end="00:35:36.990" style="s2">get to give you an opposing viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.930" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">here yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.990" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">I once asked a table full of high-end</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:45.450" style="s2">publishers and editors so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:47.160" style="s2">best in New York City of the high-end</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.450" end="00:35:48.510" style="s2">publishing company and I asked this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.160" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">question of all the people there</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.510" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">collectively they probably had several</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:57.150" style="s2">hundreds of years of experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:36:00.539" style="s2">publishing and I said do there exist</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.150" end="00:36:03.089" style="s2">great writers who can&#39;t get published</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.539" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">and every one of them said at the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.089" end="00:36:08.250" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:10.650" style="s2">no doesn&#39;t exist because and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.250" end="00:36:12.150" style="s2">something that that I&#39;ve discovered you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.650" end="00:36:15.299" style="s2">know anecdotally through my own life</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.150" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">that there is so much hunger for a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.299" end="00:36:21.960" style="s2">content that if you produce it your odds</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:25.980" style="s2">of finding a place for or closer to 100%</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.960" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">than zero and I have an implication of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.980" end="00:36:31.349" style="s2">your statement as pretty much well hold</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:33.690" style="s2">on yeah hold on now it doesn&#39;t but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.349" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it happens right away all</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.690" end="00:36:38.369" style="s2">right so certainly it takes a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:41.039" style="s2">of luck just like everything else but</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.369" end="00:36:43.289" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you some concrete examples it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.039" end="00:36:46.470" style="s2">was at a co-worker back when I worked in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.289" end="00:36:48.599" style="s2">my cubicle forum at Pacific Bell who</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.470" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">decided to write a book had never read</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.599" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">in the book you know didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:55.289" style="s2">background that was suggested he could</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:56.819" style="s2">but he saw me write a book and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.289" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">thought well if this guy could write a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.819" end="00:37:01.740" style="s2">book how hard is it to write a book so</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:04.559" style="s2">he just he sets his sight on writing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.740" end="00:37:07.349" style="s2">book comes up with this great story you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.559" end="00:37:09.480" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t matter what it is gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.349" end="00:37:12.329" style="s2">published and they asked him to write</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.480" end="00:37:14.250" style="s2">another book now of course they edited</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.329" end="00:37:15.869" style="s2">all of his writing to you know fix it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.250" end="00:37:18.869" style="s2">and everything but they they liked his</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.869" end="00:37:22.980" style="s2">on writing than they always recommend</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.700" end="00:37:25.260" style="s2">paper and what he recommends is that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.980" end="00:37:27.270" style="s2">start writing for anybody who will you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.260" end="00:37:29.339" style="s2">know take it and that gives you a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.270" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">bit of a resume for the you know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.339" end="00:37:33.690" style="s2">the the person who doesn&#39;t pay much but</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:35.579" style="s2">they&#39;re hungry for content and then that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.690" end="00:37:38.819" style="s2">gives you another resume to to ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.579" end="00:37:40.950" style="s2">up very good advice but it but basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.819" end="00:37:42.410" style="s2">if you can create content that people</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.950" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.410" end="00:37:49.380" style="s2">the the market is actually surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.930" end="00:37:51.390" style="s2">easy to get published at least now to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.380" end="00:37:53.789" style="s2">your example is here but you&#39;re biting</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.390" end="00:37:56.099" style="s2">your tongue here because it would</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.789" end="00:37:57.329" style="s2">suggest that you know you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.099" end="00:37:59.789" style="s2">well why don&#39;t I have a million</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.329" end="00:38:01.410" style="s2">followers already because my content is</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.789" end="00:38:05.150" style="s2">great people tell me oh I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.410" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">thinking about me I&#39;m fine but but but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.150" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">you in fact are succeeding so you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:13.349" style="s2">I would say that the evidence suggests</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:16.049" style="s2">that your content is excellent because</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.349" end="00:38:16.619" style="s2">the evidence yeah you got me on your</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.049" end="00:38:18.599" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.619" end="00:38:20.819" style="s2">you got you got thirty thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.599" end="00:38:25.349" style="s2">following you on Twitter and these</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.819" end="00:38:28.410" style="s2">things were likely to increase so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.349" end="00:38:29.880" style="s2">that and and by the way cartooning let</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.410" end="00:38:33.000" style="s2">me tell you how hard it was to become a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.880" end="00:38:35.460" style="s2">cartoonist I think at least at the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.000" end="00:38:38.279" style="s2">two thousand people or so would try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.460" end="00:38:40.200" style="s2">submit comics to become syndicated</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.279" end="00:38:43.470" style="s2">cartoonist meaning being in newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.200" end="00:38:46.710" style="s2">and Anna there was two thousand they</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.470" end="00:38:48.779" style="s2">might pick five and they would work with</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.710" end="00:38:50.819" style="s2">them for a year and maybe only one or</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.779" end="00:38:52.710" style="s2">two of them they&#39;ll decide to go go</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.819" end="00:38:54.690" style="s2">ahead with so you&#39;d say to yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.710" end="00:38:57.270" style="s2">the odds of becoming a cartoonist or</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.690" end="00:38:59.819" style="s2">just so bad it&#39;s like you know one in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.270" end="00:39:02.130" style="s2">five hundred one in a thousand but then</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.819" end="00:39:04.559" style="s2">you talk to the editor who has to pick</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.130" end="00:39:08.099" style="s2">cartoonists and you say how many of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.559" end="00:39:10.410" style="s2">those two thousand are actually good and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.099" end="00:39:13.140" style="s2">you find out well a thousand of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.410" end="00:39:16.680" style="s2">come from the elderly and people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.140" end="00:39:19.079" style="s2">prison I&#39;m not even making that up maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.680" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">even right and then you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.079" end="00:39:23.730" style="s2">another several hundred of them that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:25.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have any talent at all and those</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.730" end="00:39:27.960" style="s2">can be rejected in moments</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.470" end="00:39:30.690" style="s2">so finding anybody who could actually do</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.960" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2">the work of being a cartoonist is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.690" end="00:39:36.119" style="s2">unusual that if you can do it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">probably going to be a cartoonist and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.119" end="00:39:41.339" style="s2">you&#39;re probably going to get paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:43.910" style="s2">so if you have talent people are going</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.339" end="00:39:48.569" style="s2">to find you if you don&#39;t have talent</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.910" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem but but but if you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.569" end="00:39:51.960" style="s2">have talent you&#39;re still gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:53.690" style="s2">put yourself out there right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.960" end="00:39:58.280" style="s2">gonna have to get noticed right</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.690" end="00:40:00.260" style="s2">okay so my discoverability notion is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.280" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">little bit still in play but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.260" end="00:40:04.790" style="s2">saying that that talent will rise and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">you&#39;re consistent and you take what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.790" end="00:40:09.170" style="s2">think you wrote about you call them</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:11.750" style="s2">micro steps that you will then be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.170" end="00:40:14.420" style="s2">to stack up some success and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.750" end="00:40:16.220" style="s2">that I have found that to be true too</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.420" end="00:40:19.490" style="s2">you know when I first started out nobody</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.220" end="00:40:20.930" style="s2">was listening nobody not anybody you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.490" end="00:40:22.850" style="s2">know I would write a blog post and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.930" end="00:40:24.590" style="s2">be happy if I got 25 views on it I</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.850" end="00:40:26.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know how many of those were</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.590" end="00:40:28.670" style="s2">just you know BOTS or crawlers or</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.210" end="00:40:29.810" style="s2">whatever and you know now I can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.670" end="00:40:31.250" style="s2">pretty sure that like thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.810" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">people are gonna see it and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.250" end="00:40:34.550" style="s2">people buy the book and come see me</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:37.250" style="s2">speak and whatever so it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.550" end="00:40:38.840" style="s2">interesting to see it all happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.250" end="00:40:40.490" style="s2">love to see your description of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.840" end="00:40:43.550" style="s2">system which you also just referenced</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.490" end="00:40:46.280" style="s2">with Stephen King in micro steps and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.550" end="00:40:48.170" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I try to get my</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.280" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">guys to do and I know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.170" end="00:40:52.190" style="s2">people in sort of the self-help Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:53.600" style="s2">world that will say and hammer you over</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.190" end="00:40:56.090" style="s2">the head is just get started all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.600" end="00:40:57.320" style="s2">just get started make some mistakes I</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.090" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">think I just read in your book that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.320" end="00:41:00.200" style="s2">know you do it you make mistakes you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.080" style="s2">the most valuable feedback you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.200" end="00:41:05.420" style="s2">get people will tell you exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.080" end="00:41:07.580" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with it the the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.420" end="00:41:09.350" style="s2">difference between a professional writer</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.580" end="00:41:11.570" style="s2">who&#39;s getting paid for their work and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.350" end="00:41:14.270" style="s2">someone who wants to be a professional</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.570" end="00:41:17.360" style="s2">writer is that the professional writer</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.270" end="00:41:19.400" style="s2">who does get paid wrote stuff that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.360" end="00:41:21.050" style="s2">biggest difference yeah I can&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.400" end="00:41:22.700" style="s2">how many people want to be an author but</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.050" end="00:41:24.830" style="s2">they don&#39;t write anything if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.700" end="00:41:26.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re not writing anything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.830" end="00:41:29.750" style="s2">not really moving in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.360" end="00:41:31.130" style="s2">right right yeah and so in a realistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.750" end="00:41:32.450" style="s2">world today I mean if you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.130" end="00:41:34.190" style="s2">writer you could start you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.450" end="00:41:35.750" style="s2">obviously you start your own blog you</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.190" end="00:41:37.160" style="s2">could then submit there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.750" end="00:41:39.110" style="s2">websites that are looking for content</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.160" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">probably free at that point at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.110" end="00:41:42.950" style="s2">point and you&#39;re right you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:45.020" style="s2">building it over time so but there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.950" end="00:41:47.450" style="s2">other element that&#39;s right time time is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.020" end="00:41:50.420" style="s2">that other element there how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:53.600" style="s2">would you suggest people you know find</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.420" end="00:41:55.850" style="s2">the strength or the the stamina to keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.600" end="00:41:57.380" style="s2">going until that moment that to turn</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.850" end="00:42:00.170" style="s2">that was those 10 years into an</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.380" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">overnight success as a where well a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.170" end="00:42:04.730" style="s2">couple of things and I would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.500" style="s2">Stephen King here I think he recommends</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.730" end="00:42:07.109" style="s2">that you keep your day job while your</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.500" end="00:42:08.519" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.109" end="00:42:10.619" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this other thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.519" end="00:42:12.690" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be starving while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.619" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">getting your other thing off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.690" end="00:42:18.749" style="s2">but one of the things I discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:21.259" style="s2">it seems to be just a universal truth is</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.749" end="00:42:24.029" style="s2">there things which will eventually work</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.259" end="00:42:24.599" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a product or you&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.029" end="00:42:27.299" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.599" end="00:42:29.849" style="s2">things that will eventually work work</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.299" end="00:42:31.980" style="s2">right away and they work in a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.849" end="00:42:33.210" style="s2">forum and I&#39;ll give you some examples do</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.980" end="00:42:35.519" style="s2">you remember the first cell phones</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.210" end="00:42:38.029" style="s2">they&#39;re like this big brick and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.519" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">dropped your calls and it was expensive</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.029" end="00:42:42.359" style="s2">basically everything that could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">with the product was wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.359" end="00:42:48.599" style="s2">first cell phones but people wanted them</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:50.309" style="s2">faster than they could be built so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.599" end="00:42:52.680" style="s2">told you that that was going to be huge</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.309" end="00:42:54.630" style="s2">the first computers were just a mess</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.680" end="00:42:56.999" style="s2">they were crashing they were slow they</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.630" end="00:42:58.799" style="s2">needed floppy disks but everybody wanted</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.999" end="00:43:02.069" style="s2">them and you could tell that that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.799" end="00:43:04.650" style="s2">good to stop so and in Dilbert - when</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.069" end="00:43:06.989" style="s2">Dilbert was first published even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.650" end="00:43:08.369" style="s2">it was a failure for the first several</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.989" end="00:43:11.400" style="s2">years because didn&#39;t grow an audience</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.369" end="00:43:14.910" style="s2">the audience that it did get were just</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.400" end="00:43:18.390" style="s2">over the over the moon so it had a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.910" end="00:43:20.849" style="s2">intense cult following which I said AHA</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.390" end="00:43:21.749" style="s2">you don&#39;t get that unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.849" end="00:43:25.710" style="s2">something there</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.749" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">so I still had to improve my talent to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.710" end="00:43:29.999" style="s2">take it to the next level I was very bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:32.190" style="s2">when I first started because didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.999" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">practice being a cartoonist but once I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.190" end="00:43:36.380" style="s2">had done it for a while</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:38.549" style="s2">I just ratcheted up the quality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.380" end="00:43:40.019" style="s2">eventually it caught on I mean it takes</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.549" end="00:43:44.039" style="s2">a little luck and you have to hang</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.019" end="00:43:46.410" style="s2">around a while but people found me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.039" end="00:43:48.539" style="s2">I guess if the moment for me where I</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.410" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">realized that I could actually do make</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.539" end="00:43:52.920" style="s2">something of the writing is when people</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:55.349" style="s2">that didn&#39;t know me who weren&#39;t my mom</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.920" end="00:43:57.269" style="s2">and weren&#39;t my girlfriend and weren&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.349" end="00:43:59.910" style="s2">friends were like oh I read this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.269" end="00:44:02.730" style="s2">really good oh man somebody who had no</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.910" end="00:44:04.470" style="s2">invested interest in their opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.730" end="00:44:06.380" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t gonna impact me in any way or</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.470" end="00:44:08.210" style="s2">at least their opinion was gonna impact</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.380" end="00:44:09.890" style="s2">came out with something positive and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.210" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">that you know for somebody that&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.890" end="00:44:15.940" style="s2">wanting to develop a creative career and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:18.080" style="s2">to move forward that those little pieces</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.940" end="00:44:19.850" style="s2">little pieces of gold</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.080" end="00:44:21.320" style="s2">you really gotta hang on to them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.850" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">like a little Fleck and they just hang</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.320" end="00:44:24.950" style="s2">on to it in your palm of your hand and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:27.230" style="s2">you get one more like yeah one more</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.950" end="00:44:29.030" style="s2">Fleck and you add it up and before you</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.230" end="00:44:31.100" style="s2">know it things start taking off and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.030" end="00:44:33.260" style="s2">think that that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.100" end="00:44:37.220" style="s2">at where I am right now I&#39;ve finally</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.260" end="00:44:39.530" style="s2">accepted finally because you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.220" end="00:44:41.330" style="s2">issues like a lot of people where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.530" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">just can&#39;t even believe good things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.330" end="00:44:43.970" style="s2">are happening like it&#39;s so much easier</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:45.610" style="s2">to believe the bad things that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.970" end="00:44:47.930" style="s2">happening to you then the good things</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.610" end="00:44:49.310" style="s2">but I finally come to the point I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.930" end="00:44:50.840" style="s2">now where I feel confident that I can</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.310" end="00:44:55.730" style="s2">put out good content and people are into</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.840" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">it but in your case you said that it you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.730" end="00:44:59.600" style="s2">Dilbert was a failure for the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:01.850" style="s2">couple of years now that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.600" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">interesting statement because I think a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.850" end="00:45:06.530" style="s2">lot of people would say oh it was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.510" style="s2">syndicated cartoon that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.530" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">success you&#39;re getting paid right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.510" end="00:45:12.830" style="s2">getting paid probably every time it gets</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:14.930" style="s2">published and so a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.830" end="00:45:18.740" style="s2">scream success but to you that&#39;s said</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.930" end="00:45:20.630" style="s2">failure how why how was that failure so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:23.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the exact number but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.630" end="00:45:26.540" style="s2">something like 405 comics they get</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.540" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">launched don&#39;t ever pick up an audience</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.540" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">and then they just slowly go away and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.740" style="s2">get cancelled so I was in fewer than a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:35.720" style="s2">hundred newspapers and they weren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.740" end="00:45:37.640" style="s2">big ones the big ones pay more than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.720" end="00:45:40.940" style="s2">small ones so it wasn&#39;t enough to earn a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.640" end="00:45:43.250" style="s2">living I had to keep my day job and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.940" end="00:45:46.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t growing so the the sales team</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.250" end="00:45:47.810" style="s2">they they will sell it when it&#39;s new but</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.040" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t sell on its own after that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.810" end="00:45:52.190" style="s2">they they just move on to the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:53.690" style="s2">to try to get a hit because it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.190" end="00:45:57.950" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of about hits right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.690" end="00:45:59.990" style="s2">about the average cartoon so once my</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.950" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">cycle had ended and they weren&#39;t selling</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.990" end="00:46:03.980" style="s2">it actively and it was just the number</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">of newspapers they were just canceling</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.980" end="00:46:09.620" style="s2">and nobody was buying I looked for</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:11.900" style="s2">something to get attention and I started</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.620" end="00:46:14.060" style="s2">putting my email address in the panel of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.900" end="00:46:16.280" style="s2">this trip thousands of people would</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.060" end="00:46:18.260" style="s2">write to me every day because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.280" end="00:46:20.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t have and they would say we like</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.260" end="00:46:21.930" style="s2">it when Dilbert&#39;s in the office</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.250" end="00:46:24.119" style="s2">doing work stuff we don&#39;t like it when</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.930" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">he&#39;s at home and at the time he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.119" end="00:46:29.070" style="s2">always at home and only rarely in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">office so I said well my background is</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.070" end="00:46:33.480" style="s2">not art my background is economics and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:36.090" style="s2">Business School and I just heard</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.480" end="00:46:39.510" style="s2">thousands of my customers ask for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.090" end="00:46:41.970" style="s2">same thing all right if you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.510" end="00:46:44.430" style="s2">better indicator of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.970" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">gonna work it&#39;s all of your customers</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.430" end="00:46:49.950" style="s2">spontaneously ask for an identical thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">yeah and then so because I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.950" end="00:46:53.880" style="s2">artist so I don&#39;t have the you know they</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:56.460" style="s2">are you sure are you sure you can still</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.880" end="00:47:01.160" style="s2">say that&#39;s guy come on well not not me</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.460" end="00:47:05.490" style="s2">not the sense of artistic integrity</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.160" end="00:47:06.359" style="s2">meaning that I look at my work as I I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.490" end="00:47:08.700" style="s2">guess I</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.359" end="00:47:10.710" style="s2">degrade the quality of my own work to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.700" end="00:47:12.810" style="s2">say it&#39;s not special it&#39;s a product</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.710" end="00:47:14.340" style="s2">people like my product or they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.810" end="00:47:17.070" style="s2">like my product but it&#39;s just a product</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.340" end="00:47:20.310" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not like some amazing part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.070" end="00:47:22.320" style="s2">my body or something so you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.310" end="00:47:23.820" style="s2">just took the business persons approach</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.320" end="00:47:26.130" style="s2">and said well if that&#39;s what they want</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.820" end="00:47:27.869" style="s2">I&#39;ll make it a business cartoon and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.130" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">immediately allowed people to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.869" end="00:47:33.270" style="s2">it as the business cartoon it became the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:35.130" style="s2">the face of downsizing in the 90s it</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.270" end="00:47:38.250" style="s2">became the you know the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.130" end="00:47:40.980" style="s2">dot-com thing so just lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.250" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">happened after that one change so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.980" end="00:47:47.099" style="s2">brings me to another question too</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:49.500" style="s2">knowing that you are an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.099" end="00:47:52.560" style="s2">persuasion you know how to use words and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.500" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">ideas and concepts to your advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.560" end="00:48:00.060" style="s2">you just explained that your art I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:02.910" style="s2">joking has no integrity has no integrity</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.060" end="00:48:06.140" style="s2">but but it&#39;s a product responding a kid</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.910" end="00:48:09.030" style="s2">responding to a specific market demand</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.140" end="00:48:11.180" style="s2">to what extent are all those forces at</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.030" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">play with your Twitter persona and your</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.180" end="00:48:18.119" style="s2">periscope persona is that an authentic</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:21.570" style="s2">expression of your artistic self or are</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.119" end="00:48:24.510" style="s2">you meeting a market demand oh I love</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.570" end="00:48:25.800" style="s2">that question it&#39;s so rare to get it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.510" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">like a question you&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.800" end="00:48:31.800" style="s2">before when you&#39;re when you have my</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:33.720" style="s2">career I would say that everybody crafts</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.800" end="00:48:36.420" style="s2">their personality for the medium</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.720" end="00:48:38.040" style="s2">so if I&#39;m writing a blog post I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:40.290" style="s2">slightly different person than when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.040" end="00:48:42.330" style="s2">giving a live periscope slightly</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.290" end="00:48:44.010" style="s2">different than my interview personality</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.330" end="00:48:44.790" style="s2">and slightly different from my periscope</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.010" end="00:48:48.420" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.790" end="00:48:51.540" style="s2">so yes I do craft them but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.420" end="00:48:53.640" style="s2">they&#39;re all me I mean none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.540" end="00:48:55.950" style="s2">none of them are I would consider them</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.640" end="00:48:58.320" style="s2">inauthentic because they&#39;re they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.950" end="00:49:00.990" style="s2">just an aspect of me that I either</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.320" end="00:49:03.150" style="s2">emphasize or de-emphasize yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.990" end="00:49:07.560" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting part about Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.150" end="00:49:10.050" style="s2">in that people still have this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.560" end="00:49:11.670" style="s2">Twitter is like your personal Canon or</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.050" end="00:49:13.560" style="s2">like the ultimate statement of who you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.670" end="00:49:16.109" style="s2">are and your ideas and your beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.560" end="00:49:18.180" style="s2">your morals and such but and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.109" end="00:49:20.250" style="s2">understand that in order to have some</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.180" end="00:49:21.930" style="s2">sort of Twitter momentum or success it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.250" end="00:49:24.119" style="s2">has to be some element of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.930" end="00:49:28.859" style="s2">performance and it&#39;s not inauthentic as</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.119" end="00:49:30.810" style="s2">you say but it is it is exaggerated</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.859" end="00:49:33.030" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t know some areas are over</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.810" end="00:49:35.790" style="s2">emphasized or others and some things are</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:03.750" style="s2">think code-switching is another way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.590" end="00:51:06.210" style="s2">saying that it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.750" end="00:51:08.250" style="s2">specific to linguistics and and just</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.210" end="00:51:10.770" style="s2">your your overall communication style</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.250" end="00:51:14.180" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is by for me</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.180" end="00:51:18.870" style="s2">african-american and so in the classes</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.010" end="00:51:21.000" style="s2">there you&#39;ve got the kids speaking sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.870" end="00:51:22.770" style="s2">of colloquial you know I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.000" end="00:51:24.090" style="s2">Ebonics isn&#39;t the right word I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.770" end="00:51:25.980" style="s2">even know what they call it black black</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.090" end="00:51:28.080" style="s2">English or something but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.980" end="00:51:29.910" style="s2">colloquial version and so actually the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.080" end="00:51:31.110" style="s2">teacher specifically say listen when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.910" end="00:51:33.300" style="s2">when you&#39;re in school or with your</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.110" end="00:51:34.440" style="s2">friends you can speak like this but when</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.300" end="00:51:36.120" style="s2">you give a presentation you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.440" end="00:51:37.320" style="s2">speak like this and when you go and meet</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.120" end="00:51:38.430" style="s2">somebody professionally you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.320" end="00:51:41.640" style="s2">speak like this so they&#39;re very well</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.430" end="00:51:44.370" style="s2">versed in this code-switching idea so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.640" end="00:51:45.510" style="s2">remember when a OC core test she went</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.370" end="00:51:46.980" style="s2">and spoke it like an all black</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.510" end="00:51:49.230" style="s2">congregation or something and like</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.980" end="00:51:51.150" style="s2">dipped into some colloquial sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.230" end="00:51:53.310" style="s2">African American style communication and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.150" end="00:51:55.470" style="s2">she just got completely slammed for that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.310" end="00:51:57.480" style="s2">and to me I&#39;m thinking no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.470" end="00:51:58.950" style="s2">perfectly natural you meet and match and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.480" end="00:52:00.950" style="s2">mirror the people that you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.950" end="00:52:04.530" style="s2">so that you can grin cat ability and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.950" end="00:52:07.590" style="s2">persuasiveness and that&#39;s not an enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.530" end="00:52:09.240" style="s2">inauthentic thing to do so this ties all</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.590" end="00:52:11.550" style="s2">together with an another question which</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.240" end="00:52:13.710" style="s2">is I have learned and studied all of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.550" end="00:52:15.690" style="s2">know CLD me and all the persuasion stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.710" end="00:52:16.350" style="s2">and Dan Kennedy and copywriting and</p>

<p begin="00:52:16.350" end="00:52:22.890" style="s2">am I being inauthentic when I utilize</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.980" end="00:52:25.950" style="s2">those techniques is it just me</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:28.590" style="s2">is there a shadiness to them is there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.950" end="00:52:29.820" style="s2">there are these weapons that can be used</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.590" end="00:52:31.800" style="s2">in the wrong hands is there</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.800" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">persuasion morally and ethically well</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.490" end="00:52:38.700" style="s2">the first thing I&#39;d say is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:39.870" style="s2">all persuading all the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.700" end="00:52:42.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.870" end="00:52:44.910" style="s2">good at it so when you dress a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.360" end="00:52:47.100" style="s2">way you know hold your posture a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.910" end="00:52:49.710" style="s2">way use certain words with people</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.100" end="00:52:51.300" style="s2">everybody is trying to persuade even if</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.710" end="00:52:53.700" style="s2">all they&#39;re trying to do is persuade</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.300" end="00:52:55.470" style="s2">people that they&#39;re cool persuade people</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.700" end="00:52:57.900" style="s2">that they&#39;re covenant to persuade people</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.470" end="00:52:59.490" style="s2">that they&#39;re capable so we&#39;re persuading</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.900" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">all the time it&#39;s just some people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.490" end="00:53:04.560" style="s2">better at it so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:06.270" style="s2">if there&#39;s any kind of moral line we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.560" end="00:53:08.069" style="s2">simply being good at what everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.270" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">doing and everybody knows they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.069" end="00:53:12.650" style="s2">it there&#39;s no it&#39;s not really hidden in</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:15.750" style="s2">any way I don&#39;t see that as being</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.650" end="00:53:17.190" style="s2">ethically or morally inappropriate to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.750" end="00:53:20.849" style="s2">better at the thing that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.190" end="00:53:23.490" style="s2">doing and accepts as as normal fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.849" end="00:53:27.660" style="s2">the world right right but that makes</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.490" end="00:53:29.700" style="s2">sense how often do you ever just put</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.660" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">something out there just to see if the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.700" end="00:53:38.910" style="s2">tools work rather than if the content is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:42.210" style="s2">meaningful fairly often yeah so fairly</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.910" end="00:53:45.089" style="s2">often I mean it&#39;s fun for you right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.210" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">I mean Twitter is entertainment I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.089" end="00:53:50.460" style="s2">as much as information so but the way I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:53.250" style="s2">would frame it is to say it&#39;s a AP</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.460" end="00:53:55.380" style="s2">testing so I mean it&#39;s basically just</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.250" end="00:53:57.660" style="s2">another word for what you said but I do</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.380" end="00:53:59.970" style="s2">put things out and say oh I have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.660" end="00:54:02.730" style="s2">theory about this one that I think this</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.970" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">one will go back Niq or we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.730" end="00:54:07.950" style="s2">about content well they&#39;re inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:10.920" style="s2">because your content is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.950" end="00:54:12.300" style="s2">technique okay right but if I put</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.920" end="00:54:15.810" style="s2">something out there that&#39;s got all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.300" end="00:54:20.280" style="s2">of technique I do watch it to see if I</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.810" end="00:54:23.310" style="s2">was right and so for example a typical</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.280" end="00:54:25.619" style="s2">viral tweet would be something that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.310" end="00:54:27.390" style="s2">the news that day something that people</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.619" end="00:54:28.710" style="s2">are really talking about so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.390" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">something about it that makes people</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.710" end="00:54:35.010" style="s2">talk and then you you make a clever</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.569" style="s2">connection or a joke sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.010" end="00:54:39.089" style="s2">connecting it to something else they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.569" end="00:54:40.859" style="s2">talking about like if you could tie you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.089" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">know impeachment to the State of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.859" end="00:54:45.420" style="s2">Union in a clever way or anything the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:47.910" style="s2">people just recognize that is humor and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.420" end="00:54:49.470" style="s2">they laugh so when I put those kinds out</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.910" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">they&#39;re very formulaic</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.470" end="00:54:54.569" style="s2">and those are the ones I watched the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.819" style="s2">most because I&#39;m seeing if the formula</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.569" end="00:54:59.210" style="s2">still works interesting and it does and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.819" end="00:55:02.190" style="s2">it still works it&#39;s very consistent</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.210" end="00:55:04.740" style="s2">Americans yeah and by the way we met you</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.410" end="00:55:12.530" style="s2">technique in his tweets it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.660" end="00:55:14.800" style="s2">coincidence that they do well yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.530" end="00:55:18.280" style="s2">I&#39;m saying Jack has been</p>

<p begin="00:55:51.790" end="00:55:56.770" style="s2">him and really happy to see that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.580" end="00:55:59.590" style="s2">there was there a formula or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.770" end="00:56:04.510" style="s2">that did work for you before that has</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.590" end="00:56:05.590" style="s2">died is there is there like a hmm if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.510" end="00:56:07.180" style="s2">know if you come to market with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.590" end="00:56:08.530" style="s2">product and everybody comes to mark with</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.180" end="00:56:10.120" style="s2">the same product that kind of dilutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.530" end="00:56:12.670" style="s2">the value is there has there been a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.120" end="00:56:14.080" style="s2">technique that that worked that has been</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.670" end="00:56:16.450" style="s2">extinguished because it just been</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.080" end="00:56:19.870" style="s2">trampled by other people or well there</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.450" end="00:56:21.910" style="s2">are some things to get overused the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.870" end="00:56:23.290" style="s2">one that I&#39;m watching now is and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.910" end="00:56:25.750" style="s2">used it a number of times because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.290" end="00:56:28.570" style="s2">always funny narrator voice if you do a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.750" end="00:56:30.970" style="s2">tweet and you just say narrator :</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.570" end="00:56:32.680" style="s2">whatever you say after narrator is</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.970" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">almost always going to be funny</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.680" end="00:56:36.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s one of those formulas</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:39.700" style="s2">that almost always works</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.130" end="00:56:43.480" style="s2">yeah how I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.700" end="00:56:46.630" style="s2">get funnier Scott and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.480" end="00:56:49.390" style="s2">working for me I&#39;ve even read books on</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.630" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">how to be funny and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.390" end="00:56:54.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s there are formulas there</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:56.170" style="s2">is a technique to it and there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.010" end="00:56:57.910" style="s2">structures that that work time and time</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.170" end="00:57:00.670" style="s2">and time again and one of them is using</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.910" end="00:57:02.500" style="s2">the character right as if you present a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.670" end="00:57:05.650" style="s2">character saying something and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.500" end="00:57:07.720" style="s2">character has one or two characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.650" end="00:57:09.460" style="s2">and they just whatever they say or do</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.720" end="00:57:10.990" style="s2">matches with those characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.460" end="00:57:13.540" style="s2">people tend to think that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.990" end="00:57:15.340" style="s2">funny it&#39;s just like a program that hits</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.540" end="00:57:17.470" style="s2">in people&#39;s brains</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.340" end="00:57:19.060" style="s2">do you have formal training and humor</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.470" end="00:57:21.820" style="s2">writing is that something you&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.060" end="00:57:23.950" style="s2">or do you evolved through this through a</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.820" end="00:57:26.650" style="s2">and B testing or how did you get to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.950" end="00:57:28.779" style="s2">to that point you think so in my early</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.650" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">days it was just trial there</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.779" end="00:57:33.009" style="s2">but I&#39;ve developed the formula a</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">thinking way to sneeze in a minute so</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.009" end="00:57:44.519" style="s2">just warning you I&#39;ll get Rosie to mark</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:48.339" style="s2">right then listen</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.519" end="00:57:50.259" style="s2">so I&#39;ve you could Google this to see the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.339" end="00:57:52.749" style="s2">details but I wrote what I call the six</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.259" end="00:57:54.699" style="s2">dimensions of humor and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.749" end="00:57:57.130" style="s2">you have to use at least two of the six</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.699" end="00:58:00.519" style="s2">dimensions or people who will not even</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.130" end="00:58:02.949" style="s2">recognize it as humor hmm now I always I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.519" end="00:58:04.719" style="s2">always falter when I&#39;m trying to mention</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.949" end="00:58:08.170" style="s2">the six well I&#39;ll mention as many as I</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.719" end="00:58:14.619" style="s2">can remember for example man so clever</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.170" end="00:58:18.069" style="s2">bizarre naughty I&#39;ll think of the others</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.619" end="00:58:19.869" style="s2">but the point is recognizable is another</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.069" end="00:58:21.849" style="s2">one so recognizable is probably the one</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.869" end="00:58:24.219" style="s2">you were talking about so recognizable</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.849" end="00:58:26.140" style="s2">is if I take Dilbert and I put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.219" end="00:58:28.599" style="s2">situation which other people have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.140" end="00:58:30.789" style="s2">in they say oh my boss does that to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.599" end="00:58:33.189" style="s2">all the time I have one dimension but</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.789" end="00:58:34.929" style="s2">then I&#39;ve got to do something clever or</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.189" end="00:58:37.449" style="s2">naughty so in other words the punchline</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.929" end="00:58:39.459" style="s2">is something you know something heard</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.449" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">him in his butt or there was you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.459" end="00:58:43.929" style="s2">some vague you know sexual problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:45.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not specified because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.929" end="00:58:48.729" style="s2">comic but you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.160" end="00:58:51.339" style="s2">there or it&#39;s a clever almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.729" end="00:58:52.749" style="s2">engineering solution in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.339" end="00:58:55.299" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have normally worked but does</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.749" end="00:58:58.299" style="s2">so if you put together two out of three</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.299" end="00:59:00.789" style="s2">you&#39;ve got something the best the best</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.299" end="00:59:03.729" style="s2">cartoonists in the world would start</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.789" end="00:59:05.949" style="s2">with two so if you look at carve Calvin</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.729" end="00:59:09.549" style="s2">and Hobbes two of the dimensions are</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.949" end="00:59:13.719" style="s2">acute and bizarre Calvin and Hobbes had</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.549" end="00:59:15.339" style="s2">a cute little kid and a tiger but the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.719" end="00:59:17.829" style="s2">tiger was sometimes a tiger and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.339" end="00:59:19.779" style="s2">sometimes you know stuffed so that was</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.829" end="00:59:21.819" style="s2">bizarre plus there was kid who sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.779" end="00:59:24.069" style="s2">talk like an adult that was bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.819" end="00:59:26.609" style="s2">so Watterson would start with two</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.069" end="00:59:29.349" style="s2">dimensions before he even wrote a joke</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.609" end="00:59:32.439" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a coincidence that he had</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.349" end="00:59:34.839" style="s2">the most you know probably the best most</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.439" end="00:59:37.259" style="s2">people would say comic of all time</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.839" end="00:59:39.560" style="s2">and the farside did would had the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.259" end="00:59:42.420" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.560" end="00:59:43.620" style="s2">people at people I did a little tweet a</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.420" end="00:59:45.150" style="s2">little tweets that I&#39;m gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.620" end="00:59:46.410" style="s2">Scott any questions for him and one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.150" end="00:59:51.060" style="s2">the questions that came up the most was</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.410" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">have you ever met Watterson and now he</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.060" end="00:59:56.100" style="s2">is famous as a recluse and neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:57.570" style="s2">have ever made an attempt to meet the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.100" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">other got it got it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.570" end="01:00:03.480" style="s2">um I have this thing this my kids they</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:05.370" style="s2">tell me oh I send memes back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.480" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">we have this whole collection of memes</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.370" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">while we do all day send each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:11.550" style="s2">memes memes memes memes names names how</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:13.170" style="s2">I understand memes to be an idea but it</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.550" end="01:00:15.750" style="s2">seems to me memes</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.170" end="01:00:19.650" style="s2">it being changed for the word comic now</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.750" end="01:00:22.110" style="s2">they&#39;re like one panel comics is there a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.650" end="01:00:26.250" style="s2">relationship there or am I am I missing</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.110" end="01:00:29.460" style="s2">that well the memes usually have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.250" end="01:00:30.750" style="s2">message yeah whereas comics sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.460" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">are just trying to be funny</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.750" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">I think the meme is usually has a</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:38.790" style="s2">utility or a function so you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:41.250" style="s2">to mock somebody you don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.790" end="01:00:42.390" style="s2">reduce their power so there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.250" end="01:00:44.970" style="s2">something you&#39;re trying to accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.390" end="01:00:48.210" style="s2">with a meme that a comic is just</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.970" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">entertain interesting are the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.210" end="01:00:51.840" style="s2">interesting entertaining comics ones</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:56.310" style="s2">that do have a message in them though</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.840" end="01:00:58.590" style="s2">like something or now well it depends</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.310" end="01:01:00.630" style="s2">you know in Dilbert comics I oh the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.590" end="01:01:02.550" style="s2">message that&#39;s sort of embedded in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.630" end="01:01:05.160" style="s2">of it is that management is silly and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.550" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">people are irrational and you know we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.160" end="01:01:08.730" style="s2">things for the wrong reasons we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.950" style="s2">know why were doing it but that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.730" end="01:01:12.990" style="s2">much a social message yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.950" end="01:01:14.520" style="s2">if you tried to put tried to be too</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.990" end="01:01:17.430" style="s2">preachy in a comic I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.520" end="01:01:19.650" style="s2">would work so the you bring a subtext is</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.430" end="01:01:21.810" style="s2">really important in humor right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.650" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">message that gets transmitted that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.810" end="01:01:26.220" style="s2">over and the messaging do you think</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.530" style="s2">about subtext when you&#39;re crafting your</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.220" end="01:01:30.750" style="s2">tweets and such or do you just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.530" end="01:01:32.340" style="s2">you have like I imagine you&#39;re just so</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.750" end="01:01:34.710" style="s2">experienced now that you can just fire</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.340" end="01:01:36.900" style="s2">them off the subtext comes out on its</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.710" end="01:01:38.280" style="s2">own or do you ever give a system or a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.900" end="01:01:40.560" style="s2">process for that do you ever think</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.280" end="01:01:43.860" style="s2">subtext first and then how do i how do i</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.560" end="01:01:45.900" style="s2">express that or I&#39;ve done it in every</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.860" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">direction but the most common direction</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.900" end="01:01:52.250" style="s2">that&#39;s 95% of the time I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:54.140" style="s2">that I start with a situation so</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.250" end="01:01:55.609" style="s2">something happens usually it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.140" end="01:01:57.470" style="s2">in the real world that could happen to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.609" end="01:01:59.630" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s so I get one dimension</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.470" end="01:02:01.550" style="s2">so I want to nail the first dimension</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.630" end="01:02:04.099" style="s2">this like oh you had that happen to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.550" end="01:02:06.230" style="s2">and the second dimension could be</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.099" end="01:02:07.730" style="s2">anything and if I and if I can add a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.230" end="01:02:11.000" style="s2">third dimension then it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.730" end="01:02:13.880" style="s2">home run so it&#39;s usually I just built it</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.150" end="01:02:29.570" style="s2">good ones are so good at it it feels</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.310" end="01:02:31.099" style="s2">like also when you&#39;re reading a book</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.570" end="01:02:33.980" style="s2">feels like they&#39;re just sitting there</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.099" end="01:02:36.200" style="s2">talking to you they&#39;re just riffing and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.980" end="01:02:38.710" style="s2">but really it&#39;s such an asymmetric</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.200" end="01:02:40.970" style="s2">experience right I read your book and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.710" end="01:02:43.609" style="s2">frankly I find your writing to just be</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.970" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">so accessible it&#39;s so clear it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.609" end="01:02:47.750" style="s2">fantastic and it&#39;s not caught up and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.440" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">trying to sound fancy or anything which</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.750" end="01:02:52.070" style="s2">in and of itself is a fanciness that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:55.369" style="s2">most people can&#39;t grasp clarity is very</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.070" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">difficult but it&#39;s such an asymmetric</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.369" end="01:02:59.480" style="s2">experience your book was written in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:00.800" style="s2">draft and ran out on and then a draft</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.480" end="01:03:02.270" style="s2">and then a draft another draft it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.800" end="01:03:04.099" style="s2">edited and revised I&#39;ve done it a ton</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.270" end="01:03:06.230" style="s2">for every paragraph you know there&#39;s 50</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.099" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">paragraphs that went before it and but</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.230" end="01:03:11.980" style="s2">when you&#39;re reading it it&#39;s like it just</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:15.109" style="s2">an instantaneous flow</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.980" end="01:03:17.540" style="s2">have you ever reflected upon that and is</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.109" end="01:03:19.099" style="s2">there any sort of relevance in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.540" end="01:03:20.210" style="s2">the way I don&#39;t really know where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.099" end="01:03:23.420" style="s2">going that so they&#39;re just to make this</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.210" end="01:03:25.550" style="s2">observation is that the best sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.420" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">writing and communication seems simple</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.550" end="01:03:30.830" style="s2">and clear but yet there&#39;s like an army</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">of work that went behind it</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.830" end="01:03:35.900" style="s2">yeah very interesting relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:37.790" style="s2">between creator and consumer very</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.900" end="01:03:40.070" style="s2">asymmetric and it&#39;s the effort that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.790" end="01:03:42.830" style="s2">have to put in so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.070" end="01:03:45.260" style="s2">that I added persuasion to my Talas</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.830" end="01:03:47.330" style="s2">stack is that as a writer it makes all</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.260" end="01:03:49.339" style="s2">of your writing more accessible so</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.330" end="01:03:51.380" style="s2">learning to write simple direct</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.339" end="01:03:54.109" style="s2">sentences is really about understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.380" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">how the brain works and the cleanest</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.109" end="01:03:58.339" style="s2">example that is if I said you have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:01.270" style="s2">choice of these two sentences you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.339" end="01:04:04.610" style="s2">gonna write about and the first one is</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.270" end="01:04:06.380" style="s2">the the ball was hit by the boy</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.610" end="01:04:08.420" style="s2">and then the second sentence which means</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.380" end="01:04:10.970" style="s2">exactly the same thing the boy the boy</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.420" end="01:04:12.950" style="s2">hit the ball yeah now if I say to a non</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.970" end="01:04:15.050" style="s2">writer which of those is the right way</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.950" end="01:04:16.790" style="s2">they might say well I&#39;ve heard that a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.050" end="01:04:17.810" style="s2">direct sentence is better but basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.790" end="01:04:20.420" style="s2">they say the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.810" end="01:04:22.910" style="s2">so I&#39;d say they&#39;re about equal yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.420" end="01:04:25.130" style="s2">here&#39;s what the persuader knows that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.910" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">your brain is wired to want to hear this</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.130" end="01:04:30.710" style="s2">the person first the boy now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:33.380" style="s2">imagined a boy now tell me what the boy</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.710" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">is doing he&#39;s hitting a ball if you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.380" end="01:04:37.490" style="s2">it the other way the brain has to work</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:39.860" style="s2">harder the ball was hit by what what</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.490" end="01:04:41.990" style="s2">okay the boy now I have to play it in</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.860" end="01:04:44.300" style="s2">Reverse because now I know who started</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.990" end="01:04:46.940" style="s2">it and then I can replay it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.300" end="01:04:48.470" style="s2">twice as much work to process the ball</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.940" end="01:04:50.720" style="s2">was hit by the boy compared to the boy</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.470" end="01:04:53.840" style="s2">at the ball once you learn all of those</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.720" end="01:04:56.180" style="s2">simple little wiring truths about a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.840" end="01:04:59.960" style="s2">brain you learn things like we only</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.180" end="01:05:02.630" style="s2">remember 10% of what we experience you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.960" end="01:05:05.180" style="s2">know I could go on but and and if you if</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.630" end="01:05:06.680" style="s2">you make a long sentence people are just</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.180" end="01:05:08.120" style="s2">gonna get bored and tired and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.680" end="01:05:11.540" style="s2">gonna wonder why it was so long so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.120" end="01:05:15.620" style="s2">just don&#39;t and it also people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.540" end="01:05:17.840" style="s2">process adjectives and adverbs so if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.620" end="01:05:20.690" style="s2">were gonna write something let&#39;s say in</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.840" end="01:05:23.030" style="s2">a business context and you wrote it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.690" end="01:05:24.740" style="s2">very hot yesterday well when you write</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.030" end="01:05:26.870" style="s2">it you say to yourself I need to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.740" end="01:05:30.020" style="s2">very hot because I want them to know</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.870" end="01:05:33.170" style="s2">like it&#39;s not just 80 degrees it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.020" end="01:05:35.390" style="s2">hot well but what the persuader and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.170" end="01:05:37.040" style="s2">and a good writer knows is that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.390" end="01:05:39.980" style="s2">person&#39;s doctor remember the word very</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.040" end="01:05:41.480" style="s2">right there remember it was hot so you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.980" end="01:05:42.500" style="s2">can you can just get rid of all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.480" end="01:05:44.510" style="s2">words that people aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.500" end="01:05:47.000" style="s2">remember after they&#39;ve read it and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.510" end="01:05:48.590" style="s2">then it becomes clean and simple yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.000" end="01:05:50.030" style="s2">and as a reader you can tell when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.590" end="01:05:52.250" style="s2">hit a passage that isn&#39;t hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.030" end="01:05:54.230" style="s2">well done because your eyes start to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.250" end="01:05:55.700" style="s2">skip over the words a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.230" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">then you&#39;re like you start think about</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.700" end="01:05:58.610" style="s2">something else and you&#39;re like oh why</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:00.800" style="s2">did I just write a paragraph I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.610" end="01:06:03.560" style="s2">even I don&#39;t even know what I read the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.800" end="01:06:06.440" style="s2">this the best advice I ever got was just</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.560" end="01:06:08.360" style="s2">strong nouns strong verbs and if you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.440" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">just remember that it sounds so simple</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.360" end="01:06:12.440" style="s2">but yet people screw it up all the time</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:14.120" style="s2">everywhere you go there&#39;s so much trash</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.440" end="01:06:15.890" style="s2">writing out there that you would think</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.120" end="01:06:17.270" style="s2">that nobody had ever heard that simple</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.890" end="01:06:18.230" style="s2">principle ever and their whole life why</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.270" end="01:06:21.800" style="s2">is it so hard</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.230" end="01:06:24.770" style="s2">- right so simply Scott well I think if</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.800" end="01:06:27.050" style="s2">you take a writing class in college they</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.770" end="01:06:28.790" style="s2">teach you to write complicated yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.050" end="01:06:30.500" style="s2">there&#39;s some sense that it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.790" end="01:06:33.560" style="s2">sort of academic and a certain</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.500" end="01:06:34.910" style="s2">vocabulary etc but the the genius of</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.560" end="01:06:38.540" style="s2">writing is to write it so everybody</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.910" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">knows what the words mean you know but</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.540" end="01:06:42.800" style="s2">you you and I are a professional writers</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.780" style="s2">of a certain age I would say that my</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.800" end="01:06:46.369" style="s2">vocabulary if you were to you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.780" end="01:06:48.590" style="s2">compare to let&#39;s say just the average</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.369" end="01:06:51.020" style="s2">public probably in the top one percent</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.590" end="01:06:52.550" style="s2">just because I do this for a living you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.020" end="01:06:55.550" style="s2">know words or words or what I do and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.550" end="01:06:58.280" style="s2">still I could be reading something on</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.550" end="01:07:00.410" style="s2">CNN website not so much CNN but just</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.280" end="01:07:03.500" style="s2">some some article and I&#39;ll run into a</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.410" end="01:07:06.380" style="s2">word I don&#39;t know and I think that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.500" end="01:07:09.470" style="s2">my fault yeah it&#39;s not my fault right</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.380" end="01:07:11.960" style="s2">right so somebody&#39;s at fault it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.470" end="01:07:13.400" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s it just think the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.960" end="01:07:15.080" style="s2">bigger the vocabulary or have you</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.400" end="01:07:16.580" style="s2">realized the less useful it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.080" end="01:07:19.040" style="s2">time sink because you can&#39;t really drop</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.580" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">those words in there one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.040" end="01:07:24.140" style="s2">that your influence on me has one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:25.970" style="s2">you have influenced me tremendously I</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.140" end="01:07:29.990" style="s2">may use some strong strong noun strong</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.970" end="01:07:33.530" style="s2">verbs and one of them was systems before</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.990" end="01:07:36.230" style="s2">goals and another one all of them sort</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.530" end="01:07:38.480" style="s2">of just fit around a mindset and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.230" end="01:07:40.609" style="s2">the final one was really about thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.480" end="01:07:42.530" style="s2">of mental models of the world and and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.609" end="01:07:44.030" style="s2">can&#39;t remember I think you might have</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.530" end="01:07:45.890" style="s2">been the one to introduce me to this</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.030" end="01:07:47.270" style="s2">just that phrase mental model of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.890" end="01:07:49.970" style="s2">world mental model of the world meant</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.270" end="01:07:52.640" style="s2">amount of the world being broken and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.970" end="01:07:55.460" style="s2">had sort of taken that to heart that my</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.640" end="01:07:57.260" style="s2">perceptive tools this the the ideas I</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.460" end="01:08:00.290" style="s2">were I was given the frame of reference</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.260" end="01:08:02.660" style="s2">I had none of that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.290" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">producing anything that made any sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.660" end="01:08:06.380" style="s2">to me anymore like I&#39;m having trouble or</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:10.030" style="s2">has having trouble making sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.380" end="01:08:12.859" style="s2">world do you think our mental models</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.030" end="01:08:13.820" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had up until now are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.859" end="01:08:15.980" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.820" end="01:08:20.720" style="s2">do they need updating desire does our</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.980" end="01:08:22.730" style="s2">operating software need updating well I</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.720" end="01:08:25.460" style="s2">have said it in the last few years that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.730" end="01:08:27.980" style="s2">our whole understanding of reality is</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.460" end="01:08:29.810" style="s2">going to change and I think politics</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.980" end="01:08:31.459" style="s2">have changed that because we understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.810" end="01:08:33.889" style="s2">the facts don&#39;t matter anymore</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.459" end="01:08:36.019" style="s2">yeah we just keep seeing one example</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.889" end="01:08:38.239" style="s2">after another where somebody can just</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.019" end="01:08:40.909" style="s2">make up facts and it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.239" end="01:08:42.829" style="s2">change anything and and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.909" end="01:08:44.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the biggest understanding is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.829" end="01:08:46.459" style="s2">we&#39;re all living in some kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.150" end="01:08:48.829" style="s2">subjective world now on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.459" end="01:08:51.799" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing a big movement toward the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.829" end="01:08:54.859" style="s2">psychedelics so people using mushrooms</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.799" end="01:08:59.439" style="s2">and micro dosing LSD and this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.859" end="01:09:02.630" style="s2">thing and I think that that&#39;s further</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.439" end="01:09:04.639" style="s2">emphasizing that reality is subjective</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.630" end="01:09:06.259" style="s2">because if you do mushrooms for example</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.639" end="01:09:08.059" style="s2">I&#39;m not recommending it I&#39;m just telling</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.259" end="01:09:10.189" style="s2">you what it what it feels like it feels</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.059" end="01:09:12.920" style="s2">like you&#39;ve entered a whole different</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.189" end="01:09:14.569" style="s2">world but yet it works you still can</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.920" end="01:09:16.309" style="s2">take a drink of water or you could still</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.569" end="01:09:18.170" style="s2">you know where the bathroom is</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.309" end="01:09:20.539" style="s2">everything works but it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.170" end="01:09:22.759" style="s2">seeing it for the first time yeah once</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.539" end="01:09:25.009" style="s2">you have that experience even once you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.759" end="01:09:28.420" style="s2">realize that the other experience is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.009" end="01:09:30.619" style="s2">an interpretation and not and not a</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.420" end="01:09:33.109" style="s2">infinitely accurate view of the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.619" end="01:09:34.339" style="s2">and where are you getting evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.109" end="01:09:36.079" style="s2">people are more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.339" end="01:09:37.969" style="s2">psychedelics than they were before I</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.079" end="01:09:39.859" style="s2">mean my first thought was like 60s and</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.969" end="01:09:42.170" style="s2">and the electric kool-aid acid test that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.859" end="01:09:43.939" style="s2">seemed like a real phenomenon is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.170" end="01:09:45.229" style="s2">really is this is this just like among</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.939" end="01:09:46.699" style="s2">your friends out there in the West Coast</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.229" end="01:09:48.979" style="s2">out here in DC I don&#39;t hear anybody</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.699" end="01:09:50.889" style="s2">talking about that oh yeah in Silicon</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.979" end="01:09:53.179" style="s2">Valley</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.889" end="01:09:55.610" style="s2">probably everybody beyond a certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.179" end="01:09:58.010" style="s2">level successes has done some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.610" end="01:10:00.619" style="s2">psychedelics and it probably does about</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.010" end="01:10:05.090" style="s2">a regular basis it says it&#39;s as common</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.619" end="01:10:06.499" style="s2">as as drinking probably and so it might</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.090" end="01:10:08.019" style="s2">be different here but what I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.499" end="01:10:11.030" style="s2">about actually was the medical</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.019" end="01:10:14.959" style="s2">therapeutic uses because there there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.030" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">people who are experiencing breaking you</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.959" end="01:10:20.570" style="s2">know alcohol and opioid addictions after</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:23.449" style="s2">one dose of low dose of like psilocybin</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.570" end="01:10:25.550" style="s2">or of LSD or something yeah and several</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.449" end="01:10:28.670" style="s2">of those psychedelics not the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.550" end="01:10:31.099" style="s2">therapy utak value apparently so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.670" end="01:10:33.079" style="s2">seeing you know the laws are loosening</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.099" end="01:10:35.659" style="s2">up in some places you see more talk of</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.079" end="01:10:38.780" style="s2">legalizing more talk of testing more</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.659" end="01:10:40.150" style="s2">studies coming out I would say in five</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.780" end="01:10:42.160" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.150" end="01:10:44.740" style="s2">now here&#39;s my prediction in five years</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.160" end="01:10:47.650" style="s2">the the most common treatment for</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.740" end="01:10:50.500" style="s2">alcoholism and addiction will be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.650" end="01:10:52.660" style="s2">psychedelic in five years that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.500" end="01:10:53.860" style="s2">interesting I have a lot of personal</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.660" end="01:10:56.470" style="s2">experience with psychedelics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.860" end="01:10:59.230" style="s2">experimented with mushrooms and MDMA but</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.470" end="01:11:01.630" style="s2">especially back in the 90s for sure and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.230" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">I will say without any doubt my</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.630" end="01:11:05.110" style="s2">experience with MDMA or ecstasy or Molly</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:07.990" style="s2">or whatever the kids are calling it</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.110" end="01:11:11.050" style="s2">these days completely transform my ideas</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.990" end="01:11:14.200" style="s2">of reality and enhance my senses of</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.050" end="01:11:16.540" style="s2">empathy made me feel connected to other</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.200" end="01:11:18.790" style="s2">people in a way that I hadn&#39;t ordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.540" end="01:11:21.250" style="s2">and interestingly enough it was those</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.790" end="01:11:23.500" style="s2">experiences that really solidified me to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.250" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">think I was on the left to think that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.500" end="01:11:27.990" style="s2">was liberal and loved everybody and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:31.330" style="s2">became much more accepting of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.990" end="01:11:32.470" style="s2">and have just a variety of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.330" end="01:11:34.630" style="s2">you know of course we&#39;re hanging out</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.470" end="01:11:36.670" style="s2">with people from the fringes at that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.630" end="01:11:38.800" style="s2">time of society so it was sort of like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.670" end="01:11:41.350" style="s2">twilight space of culture you know like</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.800" end="01:11:44.290" style="s2">the right before sunset and that weird</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.350" end="01:11:46.030" style="s2">glow and it was just a I would highly</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.290" end="01:11:47.530" style="s2">recommend it but I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.030" end="01:11:50.650" style="s2">recommend it I can&#39;t recommend you do</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.530" end="01:11:54.040" style="s2">drugs on this podcast but it was hugely</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.650" end="01:11:56.740" style="s2">influential on me and I know it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.040" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">influential on you and even in your your</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.740" end="01:12:02.380" style="s2">persuasion book list where I think there</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:03.850" style="s2">were references to people that like</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.380" end="01:12:05.650" style="s2">maples Timothy Leary on there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.850" end="01:12:07.270" style="s2">know it&#39;s just sort of the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.650" end="01:12:09.790" style="s2">opening your mind using drugs to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.270" end="01:12:12.610" style="s2">alternate realities would you prescribe</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.790" end="01:12:13.930" style="s2">no you&#39;re not going to prescribe do you</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.610" end="01:12:18.190" style="s2">think that those types of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.930" end="01:12:19.900" style="s2">are essential to understanding just sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.190" end="01:12:21.100" style="s2">of the environment that we live in and</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.900" end="01:12:23.710" style="s2">this the the experience that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.100" end="01:12:25.900" style="s2">having in this universe well almost</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.710" end="01:12:28.270" style="s2">everybody who goes to these experiences</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.900" end="01:12:30.580" style="s2">says the same thing which is okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.270" end="01:12:33.340" style="s2">I&#39;m forever different now that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.580" end="01:12:35.020" style="s2">not like having a drink yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.340" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">can get pretty drunk and you&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.020" end="01:12:40.600" style="s2">person after you&#39;re sober but you loosen</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:42.700" style="s2">again you do a hallucinogen once and</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.600" end="01:12:45.250" style="s2">your whole worldview will change and it</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.700" end="01:12:47.080" style="s2">won&#39;t go back so that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.250" end="01:12:50.650" style="s2">difference yeah that&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.080" end="01:12:52.850" style="s2">doubt that our nation or maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.650" end="01:12:56.030" style="s2">ever have widely accepted this No</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.850" end="01:12:58.790" style="s2">everybody needs to take a trip into its</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.030" end="01:13:00.500" style="s2">corner to come yeah let me just for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.790" end="01:13:02.180" style="s2">purpose of safety yeah there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.500" end="01:13:04.430" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve mentioned that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.180" end="01:13:06.740" style="s2">think is a good idea without medical</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.430" end="01:13:08.660" style="s2">supervision and see if you have some</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.740" end="01:13:11.300" style="s2">underlying mental issues or you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.660" end="01:13:14.360" style="s2">other kinds of drugs it&#39;s some dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.300" end="01:13:16.040" style="s2">stuff so don&#39;t do this lightly but I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.360" end="01:13:19.160" style="s2">think the medical world will embrace</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.040" end="01:13:21.050" style="s2">this within five years you know it we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.420" end="01:16:44.990" style="s2">a while and mostly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.680" end="01:16:47.000" style="s2">inconvenience I don&#39;t like taking all</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.990" end="01:16:49.370" style="s2">the time to block them all so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.000" end="01:16:51.140" style="s2">taking my time but for some reason most</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.370" end="01:16:52.640" style="s2">of the professional trolls let have left</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.140" end="01:16:55.340" style="s2">me alone for the last month and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.640" end="01:16:57.010" style="s2">know why but they all just disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.340" end="01:16:59.630" style="s2">which also tells you they&#39;re organized</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.010" end="01:17:01.490" style="s2">there are organized if anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.630" end="01:17:03.530" style="s2">listening to this who doesn&#39;t know both</p>

<p begin="01:17:06.110" end="01:17:10.190" style="s2">controlling them but you know when they</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.730" end="01:17:11.750" style="s2">arrive because they all they all say the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.190" end="01:17:14.570" style="s2">same thing and they arrive at the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.750" end="01:17:16.250" style="s2">time so those are all bad days the best</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.570" end="01:17:17.570" style="s2">day by far and I think</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.770" end="01:19:09.650" style="s2">and an advice so I thought well I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.340" end="01:19:12.680" style="s2">author why don&#39;t I put this in a book</p>

<p begin="01:19:18.110" end="01:19:22.280" style="s2">I wrote I had a fail I mean it was just</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.670" end="01:19:24.530" style="s2">wildly successful and people still talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.280" end="01:19:27.050" style="s2">to me everyday people say I lost 80</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.530" end="01:19:29.780" style="s2">pounds I got off of drugs I got a job I</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.050" end="01:19:30.110" style="s2">got a promotion based on stuff in the</p>

<p begin="01:19:30.110" end="01:19:36.020" style="s2">so that that kind of encourages you to</p>

<p begin="01:19:36.020" end="01:19:41.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make that much difference to me</p>

<p begin="01:19:48.739" end="01:19:51.619" style="s2">really is and you should be commended</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.119" end="01:19:53.480" style="s2">for that and I wish the people that gave</p>
