<p begin="00:00:03.040" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.600" end="00:00:07.839" style="s2">we&#39;re good to go well welcome back john</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very nice to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a very good it&#39;s very good to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">back i thought our last conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">just great</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">so i&#39;m very pleased to be here yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:18.160" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve built a i was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve built a good foundation to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:22.160" style="s2">kind of take some next steps on</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">so honestly just right off the bat i</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.160" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">think the easiest place to start this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:26.720" style="s2">if you have not seen</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">the first conversation that we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.720" end="00:00:31.119" style="s2">together uh that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:32.559" style="s2">required reading for this because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.119" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">going to kind of just take it with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.559" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">running start but</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">i might do a two-minute summary for</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:41.200" style="s2">just to give a sense of kind of where</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">we&#39;re at because i think we came to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.200" end="00:00:44.320" style="s2">really nice end point with our last</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.320" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">so the kind of arc we took was</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">by nature of being human you know a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:54.879" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">thing in a body you are always</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.879" end="00:01:01.760" style="s2">confronted with perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">these are always there always lurking</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.760" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">they adapt to you as you adapt to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">left unattended either one or many</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">these can actually be a highly</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">detrimental force to an individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">a community a culture at large they can</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">actually be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">on the level of an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">for the long-term viability of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">and you know as they get left unattended</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">as the kind of weeds grow</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">you end up with something like a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">right something where there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">rampant confusion</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">isolation all these things that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">stem from this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">and so okay you know humans are highly</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">adaptable machines you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">going to stand there and just take the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">punches</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">and so to address these things we</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">actually do have some responses</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">we have psychotechnologies ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:50.799" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">you know spiritual and religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.799" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">activities communities that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">you know much like the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">problems can be adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">grow with us scale in size and number so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">that we can actually do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">dance with chaos right and actually you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">know stay functional stay healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">stay smart and another thing that&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">think important with them</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">is all of those things are non-physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">in nature right they&#39;re not an actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">tool that you hold they&#39;re a mental tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">all of the problems that we have are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">non-physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">in nature or at least the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">problems that we were highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">you know things that come on a on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">spiritual level on a communal level</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">and so then you know we we basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">spoke about well when a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">group of people come together to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">cultivate those things and put them into</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">it looks very much like a religion yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">and uh so cool so that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">we need right now because we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">you know gave light to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">we&#39;re probably in the middle of one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">these right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">there are a number of things coming up</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">that are becoming increasingly untenable</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">uh if left alone and so you know some</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">work needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">and why does it need to be done because</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">the culture as it stands right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">arguably is generating a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">things and if it continues on this path</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not a way we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">so we actually want this thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">and want to create this thing to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">bottom up usurp and steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">back in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">actually prioritizes the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">they&#39;re flourishing and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">you know collective well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">whole well said</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">very well said and we kind of topped it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">off with a little cherry of well how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">we do that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">some avenues we have the logos flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">states circling communities at large the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">serious play</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">actually architecting the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">we want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">and so then that leads us here today you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">the the way i was just bringing it up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">you is a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">a lot of that first conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">making the case for the what and the why</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">right what is actually going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">a why should we care</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">and again i think if you care about</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">yourself others in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">you should actually have some skin in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">the game here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">it&#39;s on that level of importance but</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">what i notice both in myself and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">others in this space is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">you know there can be this showing up</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">where you have this motivation</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re like yes i want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">do this like let&#39;s go do this you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">tell me what to do and that that almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">becomes the problem is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">show up here and there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">gaping void of well</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to do you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know what tools i have i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">know where the other people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s this kind of yawning opening</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">spawns up so i hope that and again this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">is a little more</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">uncharted territory here but i hope that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">like fumble our way into yeah here are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">some of the tools you have here are some</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">of the ways you can think about doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">this here&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">scaffolding you have and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">start filling that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">you know you might and through some</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">iterations we might actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">have something that looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">cohesive coherent answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">great that sounds fantastic so one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">that i think will be important that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">kind of just brushed over last</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">time so we did the whole ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">practices psychotechnologies what they</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">how they can be used why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">important but you and jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">have also been covering some really</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">interesting ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">on the metacyca technology and i&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">if you could just</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">delineate that a little more explore</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">that because i think</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">uh nora bateson in a warm data lab</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">a ton of people okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be there&#39;s a resource</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">that&#39;s being generated right now and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">uh done soon that will basically do two</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">to this whole area and this topic</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">introduce you to the main players their</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">main ideas uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">so you can pursue them individually and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">see how they could be put together so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:28.560" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try and speak</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">to sort of at that level uh i&#39;ll of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.560" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">course i have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">i have to give emphasis to my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">particular thing because that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">more intimately but i do want it</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">understood that when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">and how it affords via logos i i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">making an exclusive claim here</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">in fact i see it as belonging to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">family that&#39;s exemplified</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">in this anthology now and another thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">there&#39;s one sense in which i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">appropriate to start here</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">but so the order of intelligibility in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">the order of explanation is not the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">pedagogical order</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">at all right uh the or in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">the order of training</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">so you don&#39;t start with dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">as as your training that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">how i see it there&#39;s a pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">program you would engage in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">in order to undertake it so we&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">we can come back to that but i want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">yes i think this is a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">start the discussion i don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">understood that this is the place where</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">you would</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">start to answer the question you asked</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">me how do i get started</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s be clear that we&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">is a good place to start the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">but this is not the the the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">the initial answer to how do i get</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">started so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">and i do and you&#39;re right i do owe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">emergence of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">this idea uh appropriately enough to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">dialogue i was having with jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">um two and i have become good friends</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">and uh jordan was talking about the need</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">for a meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">and the idea here is what a metacycle</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">technology is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a technology it&#39;s a a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">that whose main function is to help you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">collect and curate practices and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">coordinate them</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">and we talked a bit about you know how</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">to coordinate the practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">within an ecology of practices and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">idea is it&#39;s going to help you collect</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">curate coordinate vet particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">so that you get a viable ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">viable in two directions viable for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">individually</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">and viable so that you can share it with</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that everybody will have</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">the same ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be right very</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a pluralistic model not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">relativistic model</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">a pluralistic model in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">going to have shared principles</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">shared sort of vocabulary and grammar</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">for how they put the ecologies together</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll have different i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">share this set but with you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">this set with her and youtube like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">like the way families</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">right when you look at a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t all look the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">they share overlapping features and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">all belong together</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the model i want</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">for people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">this so the idea here is why would it be</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">a meta psychotechnology well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">metacycle technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be the place where</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">we can most directly</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">cultivate in a mutually sustaining and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">mutually affording fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">both individual wisdom and collective</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to try and coordinate how</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">we bootstrap individual intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">into individual wisdom and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">to be coordinated with how we bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">collective intelligence the collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">intelligence within distributed</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">up into collective wisdom and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">is that&#39;s kind of the best we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the best place we can turn to in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">order to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">guidance in order to get well wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">in how we can choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">and you know collect curate</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">coordinate various practices into what</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">ecology practice so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">um that uh dialectic is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">practice and then deal logos is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">process it ensues</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">so the idea is that dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">insofar as it regularly reliably affords</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">uh getting into the logos is going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">give you things that will</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">help to counteract all the negative</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">effects of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">the autodidactic religion of me that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">fall into uh so which tends to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">exacerbate</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">patterns it it can</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">enhance narcissism which is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">dangerous it contributes to a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">fragmentation and isolation</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">i understand why people do it the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">reasons we talked about at length</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">last time but the idea is it will help</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">uh counteract that it will also be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">place in which people can practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">and also deeply experience those</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">enhanced connections</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">that enhanced religio we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">last time</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">you know the enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">connectedness to themselves teaching to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">and the world what&#39;s amazing when people</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">get into these practices is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">they discover a kind of intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">that is uh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">of course it&#39;s not sexual intimacy or</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s kind it&#39;s the adjective is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">the adjective that should be used has</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">the wrong meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">because what happens is people become</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">more intimate with</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">the with intelligibility with how</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">they&#39;re making sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">and how the world can make sense to them</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">and how they can make sense to each</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">other and all those three</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">intelligibilities</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">um are are intermixing so the adjective</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">i would</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">should use for syntactic reasons to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">about the intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">is intellectual intimacy but that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">sounds totally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s why i don&#39;t use it so</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s something more like yeah i know</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">what was captured</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">in the greek term philia that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">intimacy of making sense with each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s a so what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">literally enact philia</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">of sophia of wisdom and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">the point is that dialectic has both um</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">a group aspect to it and an individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">practice aspect so it also helps you to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">bridge</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">between community and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">individual practice and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">because we want to always keep the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">the creative tension between</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">individuation and participation</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">going and so it helps people to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">it helps them to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">how they can fit in to a larger</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">and then also how that larger community</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">can fit into them</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:56.079" style="s2">so it helps to bridge uh that way</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">and so it also helps to build those</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.079" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">and those communities are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">for people to make most of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">transformations they&#39;re actually seeking</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">because most of the way we grow is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">through other people both in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">of going through them and by means of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">and so the those are the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">dialectic it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s a metacycle technology because</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">it engenders the logos is so central</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">to uh addressing all of these concerns</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">about how we would create an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">and situate it within a sangha within a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">supportive community</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">in which people are meeting together to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">edify challenge and promote each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">yeah beautiful and again this this theme</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">this came up a lot in the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">conversation as well and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">for very good reason this sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">dynamic reorganizing feedback loop and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">think that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve heard in one of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">conversations you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">that is one of the central not central</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">um major obstacles with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">classic established religions today is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">that there is almost an entire</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">lack of that that feedback loop it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">very much just one way and in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">you know there is no there is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">steering there is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">turning or realigning and yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">that was a beautiful explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">one of the other reasons that came up</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">for me was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a growing sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">time is of the essence here</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">you know we should have been doing this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">a long time ago and we&#39;re still just</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">trying to agree on the rules and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">and so if we&#39;re going to do anything we</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">should have some reasonable expectation</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">at least be our best shot at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">right and if we don&#39;t have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">actually discerning that and then taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">action on it well that&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">non-starter from the beginning this</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly just a spray and pray</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">formula that we want to use we want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">have some semblance of okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">vetting and enacting and again getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">that quick</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">feedback and so yeah that does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">yeah i think you know i think i mean</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">i think excellent points he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">i like myself jordan is very respectful</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">of the traditional religions</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">but also like myself he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">the urgency of the the issues that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">facing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">and how those issues are themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">dynamically complexifying issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">they&#39;re right there they&#39;re they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re evolving it to become ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">at an ever increasing rate and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">the way again again with much respect</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">even reverence</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">for uh you know of the established or</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">uh wisdom traditions and religions right</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">we have to also</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">i agree with him what we need something</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">different now</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">we need something that&#39;s a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">kind because the difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">degree of change is so great that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">need a difference of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">kind so we need to try and think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">how to put this together</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">in a way that has a corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">for dynamic evolution so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">constantly as you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">dance with the emerging chaos uh in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">effective and adaptive manner</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">one of the groups i want to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">into this because i feel like they dance</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">the outskirts of this and at least in in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">my vantage point are growing</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">both as a as a positive side and as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">end as a negative side which is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">growing spiritual but not religious</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">group um i have my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">thoughts on kind of this group and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">how it plays into all of this but do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">have any do you have any initial</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">thoughts in hearing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">like where yeah yeah so i think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">but not religious are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">i&#39;m most trying to reach</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">uh because with with this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion because i</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">well i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t mean its own</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">pretentious i think i have a fairly good</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">of where they&#39;re at and where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">so on the one hand to say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">not religious what do they mean by</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">saying they&#39;re not religious let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">work it that way</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">what they typically mean is they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">want to belong to any organization</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">that has any kind of political structure</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">any kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">of stable um ideological framework that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">adhered to um now now there&#39;s mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">but let&#39;s let&#39;s try and pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">what&#39;s motivating it well what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">motivating it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">they have right they have seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">um those con they have seen political</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">and ideological uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">world views drenched the world in blood</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">and continue to do so and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">intuition often</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s more of an explicit</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">argument that that way of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">is driving the polarization that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">ripping the you know what ripping the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">united states apart</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">and in some ways that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">infecting the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s inevitably going to um so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">i understand where that&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">why don&#39;t they just become</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">atheists then why don&#39;t they just line</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">up behind sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">uh or richard dawkins funny enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">sam harris is actually becoming is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">the right way to say he&#39;s becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">and more spiritual with time</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">as things unfold uh but you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">why not just become an atheist and just</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">well because first of all the secular</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">political ideological</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">uh organizations and movements have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">just as bad in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">if not worse in drenching the world in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">blood so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:11.679" style="s2">no right and then the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">and this is you know this goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.679" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">heart of what we talked about last time</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">there was something in these religions</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">there was something in these religions</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">there were practices</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">there&#39;s an intuitive sense that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">i i get into these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">these self-deceptive self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">patterns and i get disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">myself and other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">and i i don&#39;t know how to come how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">integrate</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">uh aspects of myself um</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">in a way that seems to take or to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">sustain and so i</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">i i want to be spiritual meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">typically i want to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">practices of self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">self-transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">that will make me wiser i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">not always the word that&#39;s used but i</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">would argue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">that&#39;s always that&#39;s always the concept</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.080" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">and so they they get that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">wisdom is needed and that wisdom isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">learning knowledge from a book wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of knowing that requires</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">deep transformation and so what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">mean is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">well i care about these problems of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">meaning and i care about cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">wisdom but i&#39;m terrified of both the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">past and the political past and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">terrified of ideological thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">and so i&#39;m going to be spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">religious do you think that&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">of what&#39;s at work for this group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">yeah so so the thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">for me is i i understand that problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">articulate what i call the religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">in that it&#39;s a religion in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">acknowledge that there&#39;s so much from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">religious heritage</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">that we need uh to we need to exact</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s also acknowledging that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to fall into</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">uh the the the the traditional thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">even the secular versions of them well</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">within you know nazism and communism</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">because those are to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">pseudo-religious ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">uh and so we don&#39;t want we we want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">somehow do that acceptation without</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">falling into</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">any of the any of the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">temptations</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">um and populism is also a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">temptation and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">a highly pseudo-religious uh phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">um look at how people are following</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">trump i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">right so um so all of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">being the case i i think i take i take</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">that problem very seriously now</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">i think the spiritually but not</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.840" style="s2">religious people</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">are also making some very serious</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">so one of the most serious mistakes is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">be identified with well this is a purely</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">individual project</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">this is something i do on my own i do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">for myself and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">that very quickly isn&#39;t really not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">religion it&#39;s just the religion of me</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">yeah the religion of me and why my</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">experiences are sacred</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">and the things i go through and then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">is it has the problems we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:26.679" style="s2">earlier that really</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">really exacerbates all of the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.679" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">autodidactism</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">it locks you into individualism</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">as an ideology and let&#39;s be clear here</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not talking about moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">individual responsibility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">something we all bear</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">and is inescapable and we are obligated</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">for that i&#39;m talking about a particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">of how human beings are and how they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">should live that is called individualism</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">generated historically in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">enlightenment period</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">and i think that ideology is largely</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">[ __ ] because most of our development</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">and most of our cognition is done in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">distributed cognition and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">evidence that we are much better at</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">growing and overcoming self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">in distributed cognition we are much</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">more rational in distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">than we are in individual cognition now</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">of course distributed cognition can go</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">off to rails too</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we have to do what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">were talking about earlier we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">have to organize it properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">but i think the idea that well i can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">this individually auto didactically</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">that&#39;s you know you&#39;re gonna that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">gonna be rife with error</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">secondly it tends to promote</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">a kind of narcissism it tends to uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">it tends and the individual is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">individualism and narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">they tend to reinforce each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">because what tends to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:51.919" style="s2">people tend to get into the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">what i should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">is collecting wonderful experiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">that i can put on my little ego trophy</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">shelf</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">that show to myself and to anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">challenges me</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">how really unique and special i am</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">and therefore why you should pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">attention to me or consider me important</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">even though i haven&#39;t done anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">particularly ethically</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">or epistemically useful or important to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">and and and and that&#39;s a big big problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">the third thing and these are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">necessarily separate these are only</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">analytic distinctions they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">found together</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">right is the phenomena of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">bypass which is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">that i will avoid you know pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">and trauma and deep character flaws and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">personality disorders or defects because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">by being spiritual and i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">bypass</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">all of the messy [ __ ] that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">is at the core of human spirituality you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">look through the wisdom traditions they</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">telling people you don&#39;t write you you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">that that that messy stuff that yucky</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">right that is an integral part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">and so people use spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">as a way of engaging in spiritual bypass</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">and so there&#39;s just a lot of dangers</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">again remember what i said at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">beginning everyone i understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">i i think i have a fairly good</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">why people do this what&#39;s their what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">their reasoning and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">motivation</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">but i&#39;m asking everyone now to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">equally the dangers and the threats and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">we need to pursue an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">spiritual but not religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">yeah yeah that was incredible so many</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">i have actually a few points to add on</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">that because that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">absolutely masterful you know and again</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">i think it is worth acknowledging like</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">it it is coming from a place of good</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">faith right it&#39;s people&#39;s like i do</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">recognize the need in this because i</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">probably you know they probably come</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">from a point where</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">i didn&#39;t have this before all these</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">things came up as</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">expected right again wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">been talking about this for a while</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like okay i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">this and then we run into this</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">like baby in the bathwater thing where</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like well i don&#39;t want to believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">you know resurrection of jesus and these</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">fairy tales so obviously the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">is bunk</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">let me go discover all this for myself i</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">think the biggest point of it that comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">up for me is you know we were just</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">time is of the essence here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">like i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t have the time to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">wait for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">to make all the mistakes that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">have been making for several thousand</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">and they wrote it down they wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">the ways to actually like avoid that or</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">get through it easier</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">and yet you&#39;re just off you know running</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">around doing all this stuff for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">you know you come across the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">oh i realized i&#39;m god it&#39;s like okay you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">know we got to go through this thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">that&#39;s going to take up some more time</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">right right there&#39;s there&#39;s just all</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">these things that have been written down</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">and i think and again one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">that gets avoided</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">is if you are taking this seriously</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">because it can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">i think there is this sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">the spiritual world as kind of hippy</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">dippy nonsense like it&#39;s all just flower</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">digging down or taking it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">enough it is it can be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">yes you know you&#39;re rewriting the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">you view reality you&#39;re rewriting your</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">in the entire story it is not always</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">and to counter balance that you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">containers</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">you need containers that are conducive</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">to do the already difficult work</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing that by yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">don&#39;t have the community the container</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">again it just goes haywire it goes</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">haywire really quickly and you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">actually do an extreme amount of damage</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">to yourself this is how you get stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">like cults too like this is how you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">pretty much ridiculous stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah so to your point like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">there are real threats and dangers</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">and the greatest part about that is we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">answer those because they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">answered by</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">several different traditions for several</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">thousand years it&#39;s like yeah okay like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">they are right here and yes again</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">nothing is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">no one is perfect nothing we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">made is perfect but that does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">by any sense that we can just toss out</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">entire uh utility of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">i think that&#39;s well said the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">task</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">is again to as you said respect the good</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">it&#39;s that how do i</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">and this is again where you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">this on your own is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.960" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">not a good idea you know you should</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">so when you you&#39;re on one that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">think about holding in two hands</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">on one hand you should be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">these traditions but you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">trying to you have this question</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">well how do i know what i should take</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">from these</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">and also how should i take it from them</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">this is where cognitive science can be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">tremendous help and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">science is also something you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">autodidactically it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">by getting involved right yeah you may</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">not want or</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">want or be able to belong to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">but there are many people you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">who are offering to help bridge who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:21.039" style="s2">offering to help say</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">here is that cognitive science and here</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">is how</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">you can make use of it so you can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">guidance</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">on how to draw from these traditions</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">and how you can draw from these</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">traditions in a way that will ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">fit into a scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">yeah potentially transform it and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">that that&#39;s a tricky thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s it it&#39;s also interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">this other creative</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">tonos this tension we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">manage between as you said providing</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">people with containers you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">or you&#39;re going to hit that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">to hit the you&#39;re going to hit the frame</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">problem if you don&#39;t frame things</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">um so totally totally on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">but you also want to give</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">space right you know so that emergence</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">can happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">precisely because we can&#39;t just repeat</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">that this is where jordan&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">comes in again uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">and we have to acknowledge that there</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">emerging communities of practice that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">are doing what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">but they&#39;re also innovating and coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">up with new ideas like i was just</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">talking again to him yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">my good friend uh rafe kelly and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">he&#39;s doing uh and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">like trying to get all of that held</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">properly together</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">this is again why we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">distributed cognition we need the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">logos we&#39;ve got it we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">to get we got to give it our ver we got</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">to tap</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">into our evolving very best of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">in order to help people with these</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">oh that&#39;s beautiful yeah the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">that came up there as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">is um what when people do try to to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">stuff because they might actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:01.039" style="s2">the point of also acknowledging i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">like okay well the whole thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.039" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t nonsense but then you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">i called it i was writing about this the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">other day i called it the mr god tato</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">head where you just</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">end up with this mashup of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">neo-buddhist hindu stuff and it just</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">comes together in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">amorphous blob that actually ends up</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">less sense when they try to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">it than any of the individual ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">yeah it drives this sense of well this</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">is the process of a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">and you know in some ways that point is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">valid but in others it&#39;s well what are</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">you actually trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">yeah and again even you know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">question becomes impossible to answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">know what they&#39;re exactly trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">they don&#39;t have language for it</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">they don&#39;t have pathways to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yes you know your evolving</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">takes eight decades that could actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">you know an outcome of a process however</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">we can come up with the chances that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get that on your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">uh by being an eclectic dabbler</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">are very small are very small again</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">i understand why people are tempted that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">um and i i want to be responsive to that</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">that is not a good strategy and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">certainly especially now</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">uh not a good strategy because of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">exigent</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">nature of the situation we&#39;re in yeah</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">he is an ongoing ra and ta and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">co-authored with me</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">that and big hat tip to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">cognitive science of magic that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">unbelievable one of the lines that came</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">is uh you know religion and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">as practices do not require the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">supernatural as a theory to function</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s right and i don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">you have a comment on that but i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">absolutely worth putting in because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">may very well be again there aren&#39;t many</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">current examples of religious spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">institutions that don&#39;t invoke</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">some sense of supernatural woo which i</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">think turns a lot of people away from</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">it does it&#39;s not a requirement no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">i mean and you know and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">uh i&#39;m doing and the work that jun&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">doing the work we&#39;re doing together</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">is gathering increasing empirical</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">evidence to support that claim by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">beautiful okay so there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">theoretical argument and good empirical</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">um part of the problem um i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">is uh i mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">the abrahamic religions were really</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">successful in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">uh sort of getting us to deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">believe almost like into the grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">how we think about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">uh that um that their model of religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">um was how all religions work and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">this caused</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">so much disaster it was one of many</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">why eur european colonialism was so</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">devastating</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">uh because the europeans would go into</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">these other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">um they couldn&#39;t even find a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">that was separable out</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">that they could call religion so they</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">would have to sort of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">force that with sort of the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">pigeonholing extracting something out</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:34.000" style="s2">really shouldn&#39;t be extracted out and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">then re-understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.000" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">in terms of a belief system and all this</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">stuff and you know that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">and then often just treating it like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">noise and garbage</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">right and so i think we</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">should we&#39;ve got good historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">why we should pause and think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">that but we know that the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">is something that and i talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">in my series i give the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">uh argument it&#39;s something that emerged</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">within the west um and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">thinking that well that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">just has to be or it&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay fine if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">call it religion if it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">supernatural then i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">religion or something else right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">interested in whatever it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">enhancing religio</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">so that people have experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">they call are sacred</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">because they get into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">with what is most ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">real about themselves each other and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t want to call that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:34.000" style="s2">religion then fine i don&#39;t care but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">think that is the core</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.000" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">of what religions have done and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">given arguments for that and we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">very clear historical precedence the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">neoplatonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">right yes it has right it has</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">metaphysical levels</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re not like um our notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">in fact you can see the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">church fathers taking the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">and wrestling it so it fits in right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">and eventually gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">organized into especially people like</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">aquinas right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">gets organized into our category of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">supernatural and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">there so first of all that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">problematic category</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">second as i&#39;ve argued i think it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">we we sort of legitimated</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">and ossified the two</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where that noise is coming</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">from yours or my end</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">um legitimated and ossified</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">um the two worlds mythology the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">that reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">is made up of two fundamentally uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">different worlds um and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">and i again i think that was something i</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">understand and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">i try to explain why that mythology</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">arose but the scientific worldview will</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">not countenance that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">um and and if you say well i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">going to ignore the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">good luck</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">go try that try that right now during</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">covet right</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">what does that mean like i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">like all i don&#39;t believe this well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">yeah you do because you go to the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">and you turn on the internet and you use</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">all of this technology and electricity</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">and electromagnetism and physics and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">and by like you can&#39;t that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">pretense okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">now i&#39;m not i&#39;m i&#39;m not arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">scientism</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that if science is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">only thing or that all of the current</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">claims of science are true i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">but the idea that we can somehow well</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">the scientific worldview and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">going to somehow keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">the supernatural the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">mythology that strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">as very uh non-viable it&#39;s like i said</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">we have good historical and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">cross-cultural reason to suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">to suspect that that is of the essence</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">of religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">we have geniuses like platinus and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">who gave us uh alternatives profound</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">monisms</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">ultimately that do not support uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">the dualism of a supernaturalism that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">dualism</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">tended to support an internalized</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">version of the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">we internalize that dualism as a deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">dualism between mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">the mind and body are two separate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">two distinct kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">and we were and we sort of reduced</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">religion into</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">like very much in the head uh and our</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">sense of who and what we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">and what we&#39;re now discovering both in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">cognitive science and the whole rise of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">the embodied movement</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">movement they should come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">better name um</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:29.520" style="s2">is that no that that dualism of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.520" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just not sustainable so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">of that commitment and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">i think trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">come up with a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">of being spiritual and you now know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean in an auto didactic</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">isolated monological fashion trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">without recourse to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">the supernatural is deeply needed</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">today it&#39;s deeply deeply needed and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve already given you arguments for why</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely possible and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">already happening it&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">so if we can come to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to invoke we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">invoke or commit to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">these powerful kinds of dualisms</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">these dualisms were originally</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">functional but the problem is they</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">became malfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">and a dualism that becomes malfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">becomes a profound</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">dichotomous disconnection and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">it disconnects you in profound ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">from yourself from each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">world and that undermines</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">the religion the meaning making their</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">sacredness in a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">yeah and actually that visual you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">gave there is a i think a feeling that a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">lot of people have coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">space it&#39;s like i am torn between</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">these drives or these feelings inside of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">me and i just</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s untenable i feel like i&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">apart at the end it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s very true it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">it always makes me laugh you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">particularly for your whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">meaning crisis series like yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">ideas were actually invented</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">like mind-body dualism wasn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">thing that existed</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">it was actually created and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">wow these things have become extremely</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">extremely ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">yeah greg enriquez and i are doing a new</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">series right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s on my youtube channel called</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">untangling the world not of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">consciousness in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">going through that history and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">a non-dualistic account of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">and function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">as again trying to ultimately address</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">the meaning crisis beautiful there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">big uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a big set up folks take note</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">so and you know we we spoke about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">after we stopped recording in the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">one but i do want to weave in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">another another thinker and some</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">theories into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">that i i&#39;ve found at least personally</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">very useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">that of jamie wheel and some of his some</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">of his work around ethical culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">we talked in the first one about how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">know this kind of religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">religion and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">stealing the culture and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">of culture are more of like an</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">interweaving dna than</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">than separate initiatives here but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">of this conversation a lot of our first</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">one was around</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:35.119" style="s2">well we need to get in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">self other and world</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.119" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">and again we bookmarked this whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">beginning as a kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">what you know what what do i do i</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">understand that i need to do that how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">i actually do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">and jamie puts forward and again i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">with some collaboration from you as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">these three pillars of if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">to have practices they should probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">these three things and i love them</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">extasis</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">like a feeling of self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">connecting to something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">catharsis the kind of deep healing that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">comes from that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">that we can get of being an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">individual and community</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">communities right the sense that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">actually in this together all going</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">through the need for those first two</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">anything coming up for you around that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">yeah i i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">i have talked with i give all credit</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">to jamie and organizing those</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked to him i think i had an</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">extended conversation with with him just</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s been some email</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">exchanges um</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">i i think that&#39;s important um</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">independent of him</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">i was talking about x-states i have</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">extensions tattooed on my leg</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">uh i was talking about extensiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">communities uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">for a very long time um now so the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">part that uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">jamie has put more emphasis on uh that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t addressed as much</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">but um i am turning my attention to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">is catharsis uh again with that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">jamie doesn&#39;t mean it this way</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think of it just in the freudian</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">sense of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">right you know the big discharge right</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">and freudian pun intended um uh so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not that um it&#39;s it&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">aristotelian sense so aristotle invoked</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">the notion of catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">as a way of trying to explain uh the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">aesthetic experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">transformative experience of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">witnessing tragedy a draw a tragic drama</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">um and so catharsis is properly</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">as a way in which you are playing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">identity um in order</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">to release ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">you are hurting or in ways in which your</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">development is being thwarted</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">or ways in which um you have been</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">uh wounded uh and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">give you a way of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">well a syria a serious play</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">the pun intended there too yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">serious play</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">uh that would allow you uh to start to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">break the grammar of how that has become</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">immovable within you it&#39;s it&#39;s a way i</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">talk about overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">existential inertia the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">get locked in and we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve still reciprocally narrowed us</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">we talked about this last time</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">right reciprocal narrowing that was sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">of addicted to the identity we have in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">in the world we&#39;re in and we we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">we want i want to be over there</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">right but we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re locked</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">in and there&#39;s a tremendous inertia</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">that almost like a locomotion you know a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">locomotive that just can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">started because there&#39;s a right there</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:50.319" style="s2">right there&#39;s all that inertia</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">and so that that notion of catharsis i</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.520" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">something that needs to be brought into</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">and i think it needs to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">the pursuit of self-transcendence which</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">is something that uh as you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">been emphasizing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">and how that connects to what you just</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">indicated mattering being connected to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">that has a value beyond your individual</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">egocentric perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:17.520" style="s2">um and so that yeah stasis</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">and and then of course we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.520" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">talking throughout about communitas</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">all of this stuff about the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">dialectic is communicated</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">but i want to give jamie credit for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">the the catharsis element</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">needs to be properly uh brought in as</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">uh the the danger there</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">is and this comes up specifically within</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">specific practices like circling</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">or like dialectic the danger there</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">is for these practices to degenerate</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">into therapy even group therapy</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">right we&#39;re trying to steer between uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">theory and therapy in what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">here uh this sort of skillet and cryptus</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">and so the really tricky thing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">people like you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">teaching people</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">to to meditate the brain no the brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">the brain has two</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">two things it&#39;s like uh you close your</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">eyes oh i know what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">mind wandering</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">yeah yeah you know no no brain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">not what i&#39;m doing oh i know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">doing we&#39;re falling asleep no no brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">and these are the two big options and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to find that little</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">you know the narrow path and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">know you&#39;re trying what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">largely doing trying to grow the width</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">and the depth of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">that path with practice right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">the same thing here</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">like people i know we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">theorizing no no</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not oh i know what we&#39;re doing uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">right we&#39;re doing therapy no no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find the space between</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">those and then widen it and deepen it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:51.680" style="s2">uh through practice and so um</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">yeah bringing in the catharsis uh brings</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">with it that risk</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s why it&#39;s very that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">i&#39;m doing a lot to try</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">and situate this uh within</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">within philia sophia it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">interesting because uh iran</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">have in his work on philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">contemplative companionship</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">does the same thing he says that this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">it it&#39;s in the family by the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">the dialectic family he says this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">group practice you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to not be like</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">philosophical counseling</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">where you&#39;re doing dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">person&#39;s individual sort of therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">uh needs and it&#39;s not like a philosophy</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">where you just get together and talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.760" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">about topics you&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">transformation</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">uh that you get from theory and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">like almost like you know scary</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">look through</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">both into something beyond both of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">yeah that was beautiful i have this um</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:54.800" style="s2">i have this kind of clunky visual coming</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.800" end="00:49:59.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like a like a pyramid of focus so</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">we have again at this top this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.480" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">reinvigorating</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">religio in both individual collective</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">you know we come down to the second tier</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">which is okay well that is done through</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">right relationship of self other world</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">which we laid out</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">and it again one of the reasons i love</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">jamie&#39;s work is because he he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">always come from the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">pyramid while everyone else is coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">from the top</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">and so then we get this other layer of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">like okay well to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">you can tweak the dials of extasis</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">shout out he did a talk called the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">potential and pitfalls of</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">transformational culture</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s up on youtube if you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">him riff on this stuff for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">please go check that out because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">and you know below those dials the three</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">dials he lays out he actually has</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">like a kind of five tools that you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">use scripture</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">sacraments ethics metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">deities</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like look if you actually want a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">game plan to go build some of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">yourself you know you have your aim</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">right you have what you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">towards you have the kind of knobs and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">the tools that you can use to do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">get a group together play around talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">put some practices out and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">this thing that when iterated over time</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been working towards is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">group of people tackling these problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">and actually making some</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">hopefully making some good headway on</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">i i think that&#39;s well said again</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">do that in some way differently than we</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">have in the past</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">because there&#39;s always been the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">bottom-up aspect and that&#39;s good by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">way that there&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">like you&#39;re pointing to um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.920" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">we need as much cognitive science about</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">that machinery as we can possibly bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">to bear</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s so i&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">in both the uh innovations happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">within the cognitive sciences telling us</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">all of this bottom-up machinery and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">top-down but more at the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m also interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">supplementing that with</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">uh participant observation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">the bottom-up emergence of people uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">tweaking these things trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">what what will be the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">that will not be idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">to an individual or just to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">group um within a particular historical</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">um or physical environment um you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">this is paul vander clay&#39;s issue right</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">this this has to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">you know scalable it has to be it has to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">be something that can be shared</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">across a lot of the things that normally</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">divide us</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">um or else as you&#39;ve reminded us</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to have what we need in</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">deal with what is facing us right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">and you know covet well we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">this last time it just accelerates</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.359" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">all the issues of the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">and it does that and in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">it&#39;s accelerating a lot of the way in</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">which things are fracturing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">fragmenting</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">and i think people are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">understand that i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">starting to understand it unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">a kind of unhealthy way</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">people are starting to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">pandemic fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">people are starting to realize it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">going back to the way it was before</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s right and they&#39;ve been sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">of a lot of people i&#39;ve got i get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:39.760" style="s2">sense we&#39;re holding their breath</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">i&#39;m waiting right okay now let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.760" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t look like it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to frame things right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">again i i feel like i&#39;m repeating myself</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">we need to reach as deeply into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">roots of our tradition</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">to grow up into the you know the novelty</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">of the sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">um if we&#39;re gonna if we&#39;re gonna grow</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">what we need here</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">uh we have to be doing both uh if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">gonna if we&#39;re gonna really create</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">uh that has the structure uh the growing</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">structure that we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">uh to address our issues yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:21.920" style="s2">beautifully said</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:23.359" style="s2">and i also i&#39;ve certainly had this sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">in myself and i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s shared shared by many this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">oh yeah but who am i to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">about this what can i actually do what</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">can i actually contribute</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">and again i got to shout out jamie on</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">this i love the little progression that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">he gave</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">he was like what we&#39;re actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">to do here is we&#39;re trying to take as</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">many people from npcs</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">like non-player characters actual</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">players to like show up and play games</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">maybe again games that have been already</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">established by people totally cool but</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">once you&#39;re an experienced player</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">actually becoming an architect</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">like start building these things with</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">and the uh like architects of culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">like actually just</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">show up start doing this you can fumble</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">around the dark a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">again that&#39;s also why you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">containers communities are super helpful</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">so we&#39;re not fumbling as much as</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">possible but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">you can always do something with what</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">you have with where you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">and if you do feel the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">a the growing need individually or</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">collectively you recognize it like</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">let&#39;s go you know there&#39;s a seat at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">table for you you&#39;re a human on earth</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">there are enough seats for everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;d be really wonderful if we all</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">showed up shared our voice started</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">playing started building</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">very much i mean and i want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">and extrapolate a bit on it so</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">when systems are very stable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">actually very hard for any individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">part or component</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">of that system to make much of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">difference because there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">redundancies built in there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:57.119" style="s2">but when systems are very destabilized</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">that they are now</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.119" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">you get what&#39;s called sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">dependence on initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">a very small difference by an individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">component</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">can you know butterfly effect out into</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">the system in ways you can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:12.640" style="s2">anticipate you know for want of a nail</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">round of a nail the horse right was</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.640" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">unshod and because the horse was on shot</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">the message wasn&#39;t delivered</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">because the message wasn&#39;t delivered the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">battle was lost and because the battle</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">was lost the kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">fell right and so you don&#39;t right when</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">i get it again because we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">again we&#39;ve developed these world views</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">and these models that</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">you know have unfolded across millennia</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">um you know how old is christianity</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">right and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">um we we get a sense well you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">i can&#39;t do much and maybe that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">true uh but i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not true now you like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">know and the way things just</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">boom now and then they just take off</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">like you know i&#39;ve been doing the uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">the the the weekly morning uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">meditation contemplation you know and as</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.119" style="s2">sanga grew up</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">i didn&#39;t make that happen by the way did</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">sanger grew up</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:11.920" style="s2">and then people started forming</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">relationships and then a discord server</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.920" end="00:57:14.720" style="s2">was created</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">right and then the discord server the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.720" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">sangers like</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">like and they just go right don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">try and move the world i&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">socrates here</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">move yourself if everybody moves</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">the world moves right and so um</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:38.799" style="s2">yeah i think uh there</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve been i mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">i&#39;m also influenced by stoicism you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:42.640" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t inflate how much you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.640" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">things you&#39;ve got to be always rational</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">about it because you can get</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">uh very inflated um</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">but i have been again let me try and do</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">this very carefully let me thread the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">needle here</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve been impressed by how my actions</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.359" style="s2">interpenetrated in connection with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:07.839" style="s2">actions of others</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">and then how that created things so</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.839" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">rapidly and so powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">beyond what i foresaw happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:19.359" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">that&#39;s worth underscoring uh some of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.359" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">team and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.160" style="s2">over over on these parts have a have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">word that we love it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.160" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">indicated and the way i would describe</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">it to people is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re standing on a road and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">black street</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know where to go you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">know what to do you don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">next step forward is</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">if you earnestly search for it both just</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">with what you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">think yourself through and actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">eventually something comes up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:48.000" style="s2">like one of the street lights</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">turning on and boom it&#39;s like oh okay i</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.000" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">need to move in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">a really silly example but can be useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re thinking of you want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.119" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">trip somewhere and</p>

<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you use english that you</p>

<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">can that can be empowering or i guess an</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">obstacle for some but it definitely</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be well i mean again</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">you have to look at these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">historically i mean individualism</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">as a an ideology arose</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">to try to counterbalance um the way in</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">which collectives</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">can become totalitarian um</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">and again but it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of over</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">compensation</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a compensation that has worked by</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">denying um</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">uh uh of the the the overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.920" end="01:01:59.920" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2">of distributed cognition so the solution</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.920" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.400" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">to acknowledge the critiques that</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">motivated individualism</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">a propose ways of keeping distributed</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">cognition wise meaning</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">dynamically self-correcting so that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">some of the perils that individualism</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">rose in response to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">yeah beautiful beautiful so i have</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">two kind of last things i want to bring</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:27.520" style="s2">up one we&#39;ve touched a little bit on one</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.520" end="01:02:30.319" style="s2">i guess you could say selfish but i</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s i think it&#39;ll end up being</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.319" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">super useful</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">so actually again inspired by a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">your original series</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.359" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">you know i was i was off looking i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">off looking for an answer of like what</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">does this thing look like</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">can i find an example of this because</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">i&#39;m down to like be a player i&#39;m down to</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">participate in it and see</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">see if i can you know bring something to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">the table there as well</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">one of the few things that kept coming</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">up for me over and over again</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">was yoga yoga as a philosophy and as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">way of being</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">particularly the way of being thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:02.559" style="s2">because i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.119" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">like many things that we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">ported over it&#39;s been a little distorted</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">with the classic</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:09.680" style="s2">you know monday morning lululemon yoga</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">mat but that&#39;s not exactly what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">talking about i&#39;m talking about the much</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">more robust</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">philosophy that&#39;s endured for again</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">generations and generations and there</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">were a few things</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">in there that appealed to me really</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">deeply about this that i&#39;d love to just</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">kind of get your sense on what you think</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:30.559" style="s2">of so again we talked about self other</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">world we talked about excesses catharsis</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.559" end="01:03:34.079" style="s2">communitas</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:35.680" style="s2">scripture sacraments ethics metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.079" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2">deities all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.680" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">and actually for all the kind of check</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">boxes that i was looking for</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">again yoga seemed to be one of the few</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">things that actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">checked off something near a majority of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">them it has a very clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">overarching goal which is basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">recognizing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">as the awareness that all things show up</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">from and recognizing that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">as you know basically all that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">cool the thing i found extremely</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">was that it actually doesn&#39;t force you</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">a path to that realization they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">actually kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:13.440" style="s2">four larger branches there&#39;s an academic</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:15.359" style="s2">intellectual one where you can come to</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.440" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">that realization through study</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">of scripture cool there&#39;s one of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">devotional ritual</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">where you do prayer chanting dance come</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">to the same realization totally</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">different path</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">there&#39;s there is the very classic kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.440" end="01:04:31.599" style="s2">of self mastery</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">awkward poses meditation one where you</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.599" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">come to the same realization</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a selfless service like</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">showing up for others and in that way</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">coming to the same realization</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">and that felt</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">like almost something i had never seen</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:48.960" style="s2">before because</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">at least in my conception you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.960" end="01:04:52.240" style="s2">of the other practices a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">other religions was like yo</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">get on this car take this path it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">take you here but of course different</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">people have different dispositions</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">some are way more intellectual some are</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">way more in the heart and to have</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:06.799" style="s2">something that met you where you were at</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">but took you to the same place</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.799" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">that felt absolutely incredible</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">and then of course you know it actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">increases</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">in levels as you go up you know you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">the the classic asana posture practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">is probably the greatest example where</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;re a beginner</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">it can meet you there and after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">been studying it for three decades</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">and are much more have much more mastery</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:29.280" style="s2">over it you still have in the same</p>

<p begin="01:05:29.280" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">a set of practices a way to live your</p>

<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:39.440" style="s2">a daily routine that is still just just</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">as useful for you and that whole flow</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:43.039" style="s2">from like</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">and leads me to the same thing and i can</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:49.280" style="s2">do it in a community</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know something about that just</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.280" end="01:05:54.720" style="s2">feels like resoundingly</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">hopeful or like wow this could actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.720" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">have some serious potential</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">so i mean i think it&#39;s what you said is</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">well said</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">uh especially how you prefaced it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:11.039" style="s2">important i want to return to the caveat</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">because yoga tai chi chuan</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.039" end="01:06:15.920" style="s2">mindfulness practices have all been uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">reduced and commodified</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.920" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">um yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">if i mean yoga originally means yoking</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">it&#39;s the same it&#39;s it&#39;s got the same uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">indoor appearance</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:31.119" style="s2">indo-european root is conjugal like when</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">people are having sex</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.119" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s about it&#39;s about the art it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">about that kind of falling in love</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">with that which transcends you uh so</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">right you are drawn into uh self</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">so um i think all of that is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:56.079" style="s2">um and i do think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:58.400" style="s2">what you&#39;re pointing out is if we ignore</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.079" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">the western reduction there&#39;s an ecology</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.400" end="01:07:01.039" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">because even if you&#39;re in any one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.039" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">these paths you&#39;re not just doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">the postures there&#39;s a hole so</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:12.960" style="s2">before my meniere&#39;s got bad uh i was</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">for i had taken up with my partner</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.960" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">she and i were doing yoga regularly and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">it was very much</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">a spiritual practice um and being taught</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">more in that way of course that varies</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">with the instructors it was some</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">instructor</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">there we have a joke in martial arts of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">punch and kick studios</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:31.839" style="s2">dojos right where all you you just go</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:34.240" style="s2">there you run a punch and kick</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.839" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s like oh yeah great when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.240" end="01:07:39.119" style="s2">15 that&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">and when you&#39;re 33 that&#39;s so useless um</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.119" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">and so to my mind there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:44.160" style="s2">instructors that are more just punch and</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">kick yoga</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.160" end="01:07:47.200" style="s2">right they&#39;re just oh do this and bend</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">that no</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.200" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">right so but there&#39;s people that come in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">like what i was talking with tai chi and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.440" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">like there&#39;s a whole ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.039" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">uh going around it and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.039" end="01:08:00.079" style="s2">what you just pointed out to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:03.039" style="s2">pluralism right</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.079" end="01:08:04.079" style="s2">that different people are going to need</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:07.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.079" end="01:08:08.720" style="s2">of their own idiosyncratic timing and</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.760" end="01:08:10.880" style="s2">placing</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.720" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">in you know how they are going through</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.880" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">their lives</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">and the relationships they&#39;ve formed in</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">the history they&#39;ve had and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">woundings they&#39;ve suffered</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.719" end="01:08:20.159" style="s2">um and and the socio economic and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:22.839" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:24.159" style="s2">structures that they&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">internalized and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.159" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">endured right all of those things you</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:30.799" style="s2">know as well as as you said</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">you know personality variables etc all</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.799" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">of those things</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:37.920" style="s2">we just can&#39;t ignore them but of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">other traditions have this too um</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.920" end="01:08:40.480" style="s2">they&#39;re harder to see</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">but if you take a look for example</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.480" end="01:08:44.799" style="s2">within christianity you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.560" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">single monastic tradition</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.799" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">you have you know augustinian jesuit</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:51.679" style="s2">dominican</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">right you again right and you have and</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.679" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">different mystical traditions even</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">within those different monastic</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:09:01.040" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:09:04.000" style="s2">right um and so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.040" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">even something that looked like it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.000" end="01:09:07.040" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">monolithic you know hence the name the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:12.880" style="s2">like the universal one church it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">very much in practice</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.880" end="01:09:16.400" style="s2">uh a very pluralistic uh model and</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.400" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">again you had priests and you had monks</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">they were even different</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">uh individuals</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:29.040" style="s2">so i think if you look carefully this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">not to take anything away from yoga</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.040" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">but i think if you look carefully many</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">of these traditions</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">have understood at least in</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">ortho practices if not in orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">right they have understood pluralism not</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">relativism</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">pluralism and so the degree to which i</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.440" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">you saw yoga as giving you</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">an ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">really exemplifying pluralism and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">having a pedagogical program of alia</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">affair yeah of course that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">that&#39;s that sorry i don&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:09.760" style="s2">trivialize but my excitement is</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">yes that has to be i would argue the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.760" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">what i would say and what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">say is i do think the other traditions</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:18.880" style="s2">but well for reasons we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">like last time</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.880" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">the west&#39;s connection to its own wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">tradition and heritage is seriously</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.000" end="01:10:32.560" style="s2">severed and fragmented and malformed um</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">and so and it&#39;s interesting because we</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.560" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">finish</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">um we&#39;re no longer doing as a was it</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">last friday or the friday before</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:42.800" style="s2">we i can no longer because my schedule</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">uh do the weekly morning</p>

<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">tech advisor he&#39;s he&#39;s getting a new job</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">which would look great</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">um so we&#39;re now we&#39;re now we we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">no longer doing them</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:59.280" style="s2">we did 111 how auspicious is that eight</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">one one one</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.280" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">uh but so uh uh we</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">we finished the the the weekly morning</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:07.600" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">uh sorry the the daily morning classes</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.600" end="01:11:09.679" style="s2">we now go to a week we&#39;re not doing a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">weekly</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.679" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">saturday sanger from 10 to 11. but the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:14.960" style="s2">point i was trying to make is</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">so we went through the eastern</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:19.120" style="s2">traditions we went through</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.159" style="s2">uh you know what we buddhism and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">taoist traditions</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.159" end="01:11:23.920" style="s2">and what we can draw from that but now</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">we&#39;re turning to</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.920" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">the western wisdom tradition we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">through mclennan&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">the wisdom of hypatia and we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:32.480" style="s2">epicureanism and now we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.480" end="01:11:35.840" style="s2">epicureanism is like sort of primary</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">school skeptic</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.840" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not skepticism uh stoicism is high</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">school and then we</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">we and then you go into neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:45.360" style="s2">which is like university</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:47.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazing how people are</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.360" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">resonating</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.280" end="01:11:50.480" style="s2">as profoundly as they did when they</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:51.840" style="s2">encountered these practices from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.480" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">eastern traditions how much they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.840" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">resonating</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">with this which is actually in the roots</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:59.120" style="s2">of their own</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">tradition it&#39;s really really an uh an</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">interesting thing to witness</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">so along again there&#39;s a pluralism the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">ancient world recognized it</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:09.360" style="s2">uh the marcus aurelius endowed four</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">chairs</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.360" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">right uh a chair in aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:15.679" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">stoic philosophy epicurean and platonic</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.679" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">he&#39;s a stoic but he recognized the need</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">for pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">right again not relativism pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:25.840" style="s2">all talk to each other they mutually</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:29.120" style="s2">inform constrain they share</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.840" end="01:12:32.080" style="s2">principles etc etc so i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.120" end="01:12:32.080" style="s2">yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.239" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">i think the fact that that so</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.360" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">plugged into you is evidence</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">for how important</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">ecologies and practices pedagogical</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">programs</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.760" style="s2">pluralism how important it is just how</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">important it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">yeah there we go again this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">really what i was hoping to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:13:00.239" style="s2">to kind of explore with this of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">these are the knobs these are the dials</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.239" end="01:13:03.440" style="s2">that you can tweak yourself that you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">look for in the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.440" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">that if you feel called you could damn</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">well very well build with other people</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.040" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">right you could build with a community</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.120" style="s2">yeah because it does you know that feels</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:15.040" style="s2">like the next step</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.120" end="01:13:16.719" style="s2">so actually you know i really just have</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.040" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">kind of one thing i want to queue up for</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.719" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">you which is just any other</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:22.400" style="s2">just any other thoughts you know so we</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">started the first conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.400" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">making the case</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">right building the foundation what is</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">going on here why should you give a damn</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:32.400" style="s2">you know we walked through a fair bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:34.159" style="s2">today of okay if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.400" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">want to answer the call if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.159" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">want to show up and move</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:40.800" style="s2">either into being a player of this game</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">or an architect of the whole game itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.800" end="01:13:45.520" style="s2">you know here are some things you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">consider here&#39;s some dials you can tweak</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.520" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">where do you want to leave people with</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">like where should someone if they listen</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:52.800" style="s2">to both of these and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">hell yeah like i&#39;m in i&#39;m gonna go build</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">something amazing i&#39;m gonna build</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:13:59.040" style="s2">something super cool with</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">super cool people where to next</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.040" end="01:14:02.640" style="s2">well i mean that&#39;s a difficult question</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:04.320" style="s2">to answer</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.640" end="01:14:06.640" style="s2">because of the very thing we talked</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.320" end="01:14:08.080" style="s2">about pedagogical programs and pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.640" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">i mean you need to know where people are</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.080" end="01:14:13.120" style="s2">at i think people need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">a lot of skills both individually and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.120" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">uh you know skills of mindfulness uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">skills of rational reflection uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:24.640" style="s2">training of the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">uh psychosomatic meaning body mind right</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.640" end="01:14:30.719" style="s2">uh like yoga uh skills uh movement</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">practices uh like that rafe talks a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.719" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">about i i</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">agree i think those are central to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.960" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">transformation because of the way</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:39.360" style="s2">cognition is so embodied</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.159" end="01:14:39.920" style="s2">and enacted uh so there&#39;s a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.360" end="01:14:41.280" style="s2">you need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.920" end="01:14:42.760" style="s2">individually and collectively</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.280" end="01:14:43.920" style="s2">collectively and individually</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.760" end="01:14:46.159" style="s2">interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.920" end="01:14:49.280" style="s2">individually and collectively you need</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.159" end="01:14:52.719" style="s2">to cultivate skills and virtues</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.280" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">uh and so there&#39;s lots of places to go</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.719" end="01:14:57.280" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s why i&#39;m not just doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.120" end="01:15:00.239" style="s2">these dialogues like i said i offered</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.280" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">the the the the daily morning classes</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.239" end="01:15:02.320" style="s2">and now at least the weekly morning</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.320" end="01:15:05.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m putting up courses and then</p>

<p begin="01:15:05.920" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">you know who are organizing or uh chris</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">and i are putting together</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:13.600" style="s2">the anthology which will introduce you</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:15.199" style="s2">to people who are literally creating</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.600" end="01:15:16.560" style="s2">ecologies and practices</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.199" end="01:15:20.000" style="s2">and communities that you can get</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.560" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">involved with so there&#39;s a lot there</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.000" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">but i mean in neoplatonism there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:26.239" style="s2">wonderful idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:27.679" style="s2">that you you can receive things</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.239" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">according to uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">your degree of receptivity and uh young</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">said something similar</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:35.120" style="s2">uh don&#39;t don&#39;t try and take on a wisdom</p>
