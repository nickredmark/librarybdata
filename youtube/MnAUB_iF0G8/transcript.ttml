<p begin="00:00:15.559" end="00:00:18.980" style="s2">which is the machine the part the threat</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:21.560" style="s2">of the threat of materialism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.980" end="00:00:24.380" style="s2">materialism and machine are basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.560" end="00:00:28.990" style="s2">synonyms yeah the reason why materialism</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.380" end="00:00:33.170" style="s2">and machines are synonyms is because</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.990" end="00:00:37.879" style="s2">materialist science establishes theories</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.170" end="00:00:43.460" style="s2">based on the fact that it&#39;s theories are</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.879" end="00:00:47.149" style="s2">are help us in in all things predictable</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.460" end="00:00:49.370" style="s2">in other words if if we cannot use a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.149" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">scientific theory to help us predict</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.370" end="00:00:56.089" style="s2">something then it is of no use it has so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.780" end="00:00:57.229" style="s2">predictability and scientific modern</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.089" end="00:01:02.989" style="s2">scientific theory materialist science</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.229" end="00:01:05.860" style="s2">are therefore an identity if you see</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.989" end="00:01:09.619" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying so for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.860" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">if if if the the the the theory that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.619" end="00:01:15.350" style="s2">smoking is a is a is a known cause of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:17.060" style="s2">cancer basically means that if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.350" end="00:01:18.920" style="s2">heavy smoker it is a good predictor that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.060" end="00:01:21.259" style="s2">you that that you have a high</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.259" end="00:01:26.360" style="s2">cancer lung cancer and that&#39;s so in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.509" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">other words there&#39;s a all scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.360" end="00:01:32.090" style="s2">theories are really about predictability</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:34.130" style="s2">and causation and there without basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.090" end="00:01:39.320" style="s2">causation or causation would be another</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.130" end="00:01:43.609" style="s2">way of own causation or exactly now if</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.320" end="00:01:48.469" style="s2">you can establish predictability then</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.609" end="00:01:50.899" style="s2">you can render it onto a machine and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.469" end="00:01:53.719" style="s2">other words predictability and mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.899" end="00:01:56.450" style="s2">are synonyms as well so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.719" end="00:01:59.109" style="s2">establishing these identities here as</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.450" end="00:02:01.490" style="s2">well as cogsa causation for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.109" end="00:02:04.340" style="s2">causation is a difficult term it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.490" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">term I deliberately avoid because of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.340" end="00:02:08.500" style="s2">philosophical encounter with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:11.990" style="s2">critique of cars through David Hume</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.500" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">years ago and David Hume</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.990" end="00:02:16.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a I mean they&#39;re people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.030" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">revisit debut maybe he has a complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.420" end="00:02:23.150" style="s2">treatment of causation but he basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:26.060" style="s2">says be damn careful he says causation</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.150" end="00:02:31.090" style="s2">is a really difficult thing he says you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.060" end="00:02:35.390" style="s2">know if I you know if I take this class</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.090" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">now I just flicked that with my finger</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.390" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">four times and it made a ring it made a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:42.680" style="s2">ding and I&#39;ll keep licking my finger and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:44.600" style="s2">it&#39;ll ding ding ding ding ding ding ding</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.680" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">that&#39;s very predictable mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.600" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">maybe David Hume says that does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">that every single time you flick your</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:55.730" style="s2">finger it&#39;ll ding therefore there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:58.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a separation there&#39;s a causal</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.730" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">separation between my flicking of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.460" end="00:03:02.780" style="s2">finger on that and the ding it my</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.950" end="00:03:05.210" style="s2">flicking of the finger does not cause</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.780" end="00:03:06.980" style="s2">the ding it doesn&#39;t he&#39;s what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.210" end="00:03:09.860" style="s2">critiquing causation here I&#39;m simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.980" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">saying that that there&#39;s a you know you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.860" end="00:03:14.390" style="s2">can establish a sequence and you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:15.830" style="s2">maybe establish probabilities based on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.390" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">thousand or ten thousand or a million</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:21.620" style="s2">tests but basically you if you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">say it for a million times that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.620" end="00:03:25.340" style="s2">flicked my finger it dinged but it so in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:27.740" style="s2">other words you&#39;re making these</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.340" end="00:03:29.720" style="s2">sequential observations I make my finger</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.740" end="00:03:31.670" style="s2">anything I flip my finger today I did it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.720" end="00:03:34.700" style="s2">a thousand times and it ain&#39;t but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.670" end="00:03:37.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that my finger causes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.700" end="00:03:41.060" style="s2">glass to ding so causation is is is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.820" end="00:03:43.370" style="s2">reduction of some kind of you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.060" end="00:03:46.700" style="s2">or it just produces the complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:49.130" style="s2">and and tries to make something reify</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.700" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">something that that we can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.130" end="00:03:53.660" style="s2">reify or something like that well</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:58.130" style="s2">basically um was a an apparent an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.660" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">empiricist which means that he he he he</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.130" end="00:04:03.230" style="s2">he he he wanted to get away from all</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.240" style="s2">these notions of a priori and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.230" end="00:04:08.750" style="s2">metaphysics and he wanted us to become</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.240" end="00:04:10.520" style="s2">extremely empirical and he&#39;s saying what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.750" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">we read our observing here is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.520" end="00:04:14.960" style="s2">causation we&#39;re observing a sequence in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">which the flicking of the finger happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.960" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">and then the ding happens we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">establish causation that we do not have</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">the empirical power to do so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:25.700" style="s2">he&#39;s saying we that we don&#39;t have the we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have empirical access to causation</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">so in other words causation gets chucked</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:32.120" style="s2">out the window for empiricists that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean doesn&#39;t mean that it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.120" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">have that now I mean the reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">got really interested now I was taught</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:38.930" style="s2">several times in university about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">and took it very seriously and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.930" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">basically it it it&#39;s it&#39;s a liberator</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">because you stop thinking you stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">thinking about first of all it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:55.310" style="s2">critique of blame you know Renee&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:56.990" style="s2">as you begin to you begin this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.310" end="00:04:58.610" style="s2">causation things but you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.990" end="00:05:01.190" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.610" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">problematic and in fact there may well</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.190" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">be correlations between certain behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">and other behavior that follows but to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2">establish a causal link is basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">impossible so you what you what you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">is you abandon that project so what are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">you putting in its place let&#39;s say in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">more concrete situation like a court of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">law or something good question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.020" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it basically basically if</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">the the Damien&#39;s inside constituted a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:36.740" style="s2">crisis in intellectual culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">Western world and and some people think</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.740" end="00:05:40.970" style="s2">that we have not recovered from it like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:43.760" style="s2">there&#39;s some people think that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.970" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">like Kant said that David Humes critique</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.760" end="00:05:48.140" style="s2">of Khan&#39;s Asian this is a famous famous</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:50.660" style="s2">statement in western intellectual it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.140" end="00:05:53.150" style="s2">woke him from his dogmatic slumbers</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.660" end="00:05:55.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a very famous Kantian that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.150" end="00:05:58.070" style="s2">you meant that particular insight and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.250" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">then it got him going okay it quickened</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:02.870" style="s2">quickened his mind and and so Kant gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:09.140" style="s2">you a lot of credit for getting going</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.870" end="00:06:13.460" style="s2">and and so cants whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.140" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">transcendental logic is a product is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.460" end="00:06:21.350" style="s2">inspired I think by Humes skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">notion of causation so we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.350" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">anything it&#39;s it&#39;s another it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:27.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a great insight into telling us</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:30.680" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know but but</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.950" end="00:06:33.700" style="s2">we do nonetheless posit all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.680" end="00:06:36.140" style="s2">things and we posit a whole array of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.700" end="00:06:39.529" style="s2">possible knowing and it&#39;s usually based</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.140" end="00:06:41.119" style="s2">on predictability so we and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.529" end="00:06:42.919" style="s2">so if we can predict something based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.119" end="00:06:45.409" style="s2">a thousand tests or 10,000 tests or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:47.989" style="s2">million tests then we&#39;re into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.409" end="00:06:50.329" style="s2">which is relatively secure in our realm</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.989" end="00:06:52.699" style="s2">of possible knowing okay I see yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.329" end="00:06:56.059" style="s2">not only that is if we&#39;re predicting</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.699" end="00:06:57.699" style="s2">then we&#39;re reducing our sense of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.059" end="00:07:02.989" style="s2">to the to a machine</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.699" end="00:07:06.829" style="s2">yeah and in other words science is none</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.829" end="00:07:11.719" style="s2">project of science so it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.859" end="00:07:13.639" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the it&#39;s sort of the best</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.639" end="00:07:20.119" style="s2">not an absolute that what am I getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.969" end="00:07:21.139" style="s2">that right you say it&#39;s the best we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.119" end="00:07:24.169" style="s2">get it&#39;s the best we can get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.139" end="00:07:26.839" style="s2">scientific no yes I mean I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.169" end="00:07:30.829" style="s2">it&#39;s an approximate approximate truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.839" end="00:07:32.509" style="s2">but it&#39;s not an absolute knowing well I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.829" end="00:07:33.949" style="s2">mean the human imagination is another</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.969" end="00:07:56.809" style="s2">say it in other words it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.299" end="00:08:02.959" style="s2">and insight you know and it it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.399" end="00:08:06.139" style="s2">really means that we changed the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.959" end="00:08:08.989" style="s2">of it yeah it doesn&#39;t really mean that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.139" end="00:08:12.289" style="s2">sort of it doesn&#39;t have that that deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.989" end="00:08:14.569" style="s2">integral you know even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.289" end="00:08:16.789" style="s2">convenient it&#39;s a convenient notion but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.569" end="00:08:18.229" style="s2">but not not a fully true notion or</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.789" end="00:08:20.629" style="s2">something so exactly something like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.229" end="00:08:24.709" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a and it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.629" end="00:08:27.469" style="s2">thing to know because one day a we think</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.709" end="00:08:29.329" style="s2">you&#39;re highly pretty cool and then it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.469" end="00:08:31.939" style="s2">does what you predict doesn&#39;t happen and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.329" end="00:08:33.259" style="s2">so and your mind is way more flexible if</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.939" end="00:08:35.029" style="s2">you know this little tiny bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.259" end="00:08:39.979" style="s2">information otherwise you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.029" end="00:08:42.469" style="s2">confused and it&#39;s very common it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.979" end="00:08:44.269" style="s2">common in image in science and medical</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.469" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">science especially they have these you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.269" end="00:08:48.709" style="s2">know highly predictable results which</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.879" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t turn out and the reason this</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.709" end="00:08:51.490" style="s2">is all kinds of variables reserved</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.879" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of stuff I work</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.490" end="00:08:54.970" style="s2">this is a I mean this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">reasons why I&#39;m so skeptical of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.970" end="00:08:59.770" style="s2">like anthropogenic climate change there</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:01.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a million burials and they in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.770" end="00:09:04.529" style="s2">the end they&#39;re going on like it they</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.750" end="00:09:08.410" style="s2">like they know what to talk about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.529" end="00:09:10.270" style="s2">so anyway you cancel I heard something</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.410" end="00:09:13.180" style="s2">about even if considering the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.270" end="00:09:15.580" style="s2">environment as a system I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.180" end="00:09:19.000" style="s2">um David Kelly is is kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.580" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">predict it as really wildly you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.000" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">speculative or well exactly so so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2">other words modern science is important</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.270" end="00:09:31.330" style="s2">only it put well here&#39;s another way put</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.450" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">it modern science is real only to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.330" end="00:09:37.750" style="s2">extent to the extent that it perceives</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">the Machine of reality the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.750" end="00:09:42.580" style="s2">the it only to the extent that it that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:45.850" style="s2">it that it grass the dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.580" end="00:09:48.520" style="s2">reality which is mechanistic and and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.850" end="00:09:49.959" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna draw but but to draw the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.520" end="00:09:51.750" style="s2">conclusion that reality is completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.959" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">mechanistic is false</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.750" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">mmm-hmm and therefore science is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">incomplete science does not provide a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">full I think bird I mean I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.130" end="00:10:05.110" style="s2">listened holla birds I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:06.490" style="s2">bits of it but he seems to grant machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.110" end="00:10:08.680" style="s2">a little bit more cred upload it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.490" end="00:10:11.130" style="s2">hugely powerful Steiner says we a signer</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.680" end="00:10:14.020" style="s2">says in fact we are mostly machine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.130" end="00:10:15.190" style="s2">but but he says the other the part of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.020" end="00:10:17.020" style="s2">that which is not machine is</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.190" end="00:10:20.890" style="s2">all-important so we need to we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.020" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">pay very close attention to that and II</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.890" end="00:10:27.610" style="s2">he is very worried that we will be we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:29.230" style="s2">will allow ourselves to be subsumed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.610" end="00:10:31.000" style="s2">the machine he thinks the machine is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:33.610" style="s2">actually self conscious spirit this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.000" end="00:10:35.709" style="s2">where Steiner becomes this is where</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.610" end="00:10:37.899" style="s2">Steiner becomes controversial in today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.709" end="00:10:40.089" style="s2">age you know and this is why very few</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.899" end="00:10:42.339" style="s2">people you know you&#39;re not gonna get an</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.089" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">academic in a university seriously</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.339" end="00:10:46.209" style="s2">calling himself a Stein Arian because he</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:47.140" style="s2">talks about spirits he&#39;s talks about</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.209" end="00:10:51.070" style="s2">this he spends all his time talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:10:54.190" style="s2">about spirits yeah and so the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.070" end="00:10:55.779" style="s2">great spirit of the Machine is one</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.190" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">particular there&#39;s one unifying spirit</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.779" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">of the machine and the name of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">spirit is arimin for for for Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:04.360" style="s2">mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:07.480" style="s2">it&#39;s an old old name I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:08.589" style="s2">its history is lots of people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.480" end="00:11:11.170" style="s2">interpreted Steiner in a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.589" end="00:11:13.299" style="s2">way it can be it can be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.170" end="00:11:15.369" style="s2">mythologically but the more you spend</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.299" end="00:11:19.059" style="s2">time in it the more you realize he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.369" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">Thai he&#39;s not speaking much she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.059" end="00:11:29.259" style="s2">speaking about spirits it&#39;s not yes so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:32.920" style="s2">this arimin is a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.259" end="00:11:35.410" style="s2">thing to explain because for one we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.920" end="00:11:39.309" style="s2">extremely dependent on aramid and he is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.410" end="00:11:43.149" style="s2">of enormous benefit to us but he in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.309" end="00:11:45.579" style="s2">ways equates arimin with today&#39;s day and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.149" end="00:11:51.160" style="s2">age with evil you know basically and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.579" end="00:11:52.989" style="s2">he&#39;s basically says that we it is kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.160" end="00:11:56.170" style="s2">of this even though it is the great</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.989" end="00:11:58.360" style="s2">spirit of benefit is a great spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.170" end="00:11:59.559" style="s2">beneficence provided that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.360" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">right attitude towards it the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.559" end="00:12:05.439" style="s2">approach towards it towards him I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">he refers an InMail it&#39;s a hate it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.439" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">he for whatever reason and another</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:13.059" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">he&#39;s we&#39;re talking about yeah arimin is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.059" end="00:12:19.179" style="s2">is a would appear it seems like in Tom</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:21.309" style="s2">Schneider I think so yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.179" end="00:12:23.860" style="s2">this is where things get weird Thunder</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.309" end="00:12:27.160" style="s2">so like your reason your reason in Blake</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.860" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">or something isn&#39;t it your I think your</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.160" end="00:12:33.160" style="s2">oars in and make is simply the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:35.589" style="s2">spirit of reason yours and if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.160" end="00:12:37.569" style="s2">understood Frey correctly yours in you</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.589" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">know the Faculty of reason in humanities</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.569" end="00:12:41.199" style="s2">pretty it&#39;s pretty weak faculty is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:44.489" style="s2">never isn&#39;t there some kind of machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.199" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">god or machine spirit and in Blake that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.489" end="00:12:51.879" style="s2">talked about I could be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:54.069" style="s2">could be it could be okay this probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.879" end="00:12:55.899" style="s2">doesn&#39;t talk about him a lot but there</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.069" end="00:12:59.619" style="s2">are many many there are many many names</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.899" end="00:13:01.179" style="s2">of different characters in in Blake the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.619" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">two most important for at least for fry</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.179" end="00:13:10.269" style="s2">Arlo&#39;s and ork I&#39;ve listened to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:11.259" style="s2">what you have in your essays it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.269" end="00:13:15.560" style="s2">perception that you talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.259" end="00:13:19.070" style="s2">about orc orc is like the flow for</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.560" end="00:13:21.350" style="s2">no I interpreted that as there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.070" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">of work in flow and flow normally has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.350" end="00:13:28.760" style="s2">do with it has to do with rising sending</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:31.070" style="s2">audiology there&#39;s this great sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.760" end="00:13:33.380" style="s2">purpose everybody&#39;s getting together you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.070" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">know we gotta save the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.380" end="00:13:40.580" style="s2">got weather the Greek word Kairos which</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:42.650" style="s2">means like it means a turning point and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.580" end="00:13:45.020" style="s2">it also means the crisis and it also</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.650" end="00:13:46.820" style="s2">means time so it&#39;s like the Greeks have</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.020" end="00:13:50.120" style="s2">two words for time Chronos which is</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.010" end="00:15:13.340" style="s2">they sort of enliven us but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:15.170" style="s2">they always they always pass yeah the</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.170" end="00:15:21.530" style="s2">complete you know bit by bit honing a</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.530" end="00:15:27.090" style="s2">is that&#39;s the work of loss and the loss</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.470" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">is in play in Blake blacks</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.090" end="00:15:33.090" style="s2">so we and so there&#39;s a kind of a machine</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like I mentioned it looks so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.090" end="00:15:36.180" style="s2">asked me about the spirit of the machine</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:37.650" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know who the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.180" end="00:15:38.430" style="s2">machine is in Blake that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.650" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">great good question</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.430" end="00:15:45.690" style="s2">we should go and find out anyway the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">spirit of the machine is almost like it</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.690" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">almost like replaces the slave but at</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:56.580" style="s2">the same time is a great risk of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">enslaving us that&#39;s all right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:03.570" style="s2">and so to replace the slave is and to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:05.640" style="s2">all replaced all dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.570" end="00:16:08.070" style="s2">enslavement in us toil you know under</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.640" end="00:16:12.090" style="s2">what we consider to be just toil is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.070" end="00:16:14.850" style="s2">wonderful liberation but we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.090" end="00:16:20.010" style="s2">the right attitude towards this spirit</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.850" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">in order to to to Oh to overcome being</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.010" end="00:16:27.300" style="s2">enslaved and and it does everything you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.700" end="00:16:29.400" style="s2">can it has it is amazingly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.300" end="00:16:32.190" style="s2">well amazingly intelligent time</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.400" end="00:16:34.080" style="s2">enslaving us right so so I&#39;ve been maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.190" end="00:16:36.030" style="s2">maybe an important thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.080" end="00:16:38.130" style="s2">distinguish between human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.030" end="00:16:41.010" style="s2">and machine intelligence at this point</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.130" end="00:16:42.930" style="s2">well this is where a fry this is where</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.010" end="00:16:47.010" style="s2">Steiner really gets interesting and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.930" end="00:16:48.780" style="s2">like humanism it expands it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.010" end="00:16:54.900" style="s2">really difficult but at the same time a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.780" end="00:16:58.860" style="s2">very simple argument he says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.900" end="00:17:01.020" style="s2">another spirit which he calls Lucifer so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.860" end="00:17:03.780" style="s2">Lucifer is a fascinating spirit and of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.020" end="00:17:05.880" style="s2">course we in our sort of lame lay</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.780" end="00:17:07.890" style="s2">Western culture think of Lucifer&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.880" end="00:17:10.860" style="s2">the devil but Lucifer&#39;s account for</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.890" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">persona is not is not that way Lucifer</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.860" end="00:17:18.690" style="s2">is first of all was necessary for humans</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">to have freedom so Lucifer&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.690" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">of free choice that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:27.750" style="s2">Lucifer&#39;s and new suffer I understand to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:30.360" style="s2">be the spirit of ideology and its many</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.750" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">ways to the orc that we just spoke up</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.360" end="00:17:36.930" style="s2">and Blake that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.740" end="00:17:39.390" style="s2">yeah and and any and Steiner says that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.930" end="00:17:40.150" style="s2">arimin and Lucifer the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.390" end="00:17:44.020" style="s2">Machine and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.150" end="00:17:46.930" style="s2">and the spirit of Audiology I have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.020" end="00:17:50.140" style="s2">kind of a devil pact and so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.930" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">is that our technical world changes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.140" end="00:17:59.320" style="s2">it stirs up a an ideological at like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">know there&#39;s a kind of restoring there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.320" end="00:18:02.620" style="s2">a relationship between you can never</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:05.590" style="s2">really fully link or link up the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.620" end="00:18:08.910" style="s2">relationship between them for example I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.590" end="00:18:11.830" style="s2">believe right now one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.910" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">this identity politics is going mad is</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.830" end="00:18:16.540" style="s2">simply because there&#39;s a lot of fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:18.910" style="s2">about employment in the future and about</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.540" end="00:18:22.120" style="s2">by finding place and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.910" end="00:18:23.740" style="s2">creating this bizarre identity place but</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.120" end="00:18:26.170" style="s2">the reason why we&#39;re fine we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.740" end="00:18:28.600" style="s2">trouble finding a place is because of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.170" end="00:18:30.550" style="s2">the power of technology technology is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:33.010" style="s2">replacing all of our work and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.550" end="00:18:34.809" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.010" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">belonging connected to our work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.809" end="00:18:40.179" style="s2">so technology created this great</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:41.500" style="s2">liberation at the same time we&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.179" end="00:18:43.900" style="s2">worried about it so we created there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.500" end="00:18:45.970" style="s2">counter ideologies and then what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.900" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">happens is there&#39;s this devil pact where</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.970" end="00:18:51.070" style="s2">when one is when one is asleep and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">run out of run out of steam the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.070" end="00:18:55.150" style="s2">one is going mad the ideology you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.190" style="s2">biological part of us is going yet and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.150" end="00:19:00.210" style="s2">then detect a lot technical projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.190" end="00:19:03.370" style="s2">over so the internet is it is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.210" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">confusing you know whirlwind chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.370" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">whirlwind in our lives and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">ideological response to it and you go</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.920" style="s2">back in time go back to 1950s and when</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:13.690" style="s2">the car was that what became this great</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.920" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">new technical thing well all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.690" end="00:19:17.710" style="s2">all these new roads had build these</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:20.890" style="s2">highways traffic you know pollution and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:22.300" style="s2">this is missus aromatic aromatic chaos</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.890" end="00:19:24.340" style="s2">at work and then you have these other</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.300" end="00:19:27.850" style="s2">ideological responses like the hippies</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.340" end="00:19:30.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a big ideological reaction so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.850" end="00:19:35.050" style="s2">have this devil pact and there they</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.190" end="00:19:37.090" style="s2">never agree and and humans are forever</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.670" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">between these Lucifer is this larger and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:17.330" style="s2">larger than life one here&#39;s Steiners</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.330" end="00:21:24.740" style="s2">he says if you were to take the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.920" end="00:21:27.410" style="s2">beautiful works of art the absolute most</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.740" end="00:21:33.400" style="s2">sublime works of art yeah and you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.410" end="00:21:36.740" style="s2">to have one show before you and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.400" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">another appear before you a little while</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.740" end="00:21:42.860" style="s2">later and then this carried on forever</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:44.120" style="s2">mm-hmm this is the spirit of Lucifer in</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.860" end="00:21:49.940" style="s2">other words Lucifer is bound up with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.120" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">Arts is it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s coming I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.940" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">of it&#39;s like gay culture like totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">Lucifer right you got to spend time on</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.850" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">in Steiner to understand what he means</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.070" end="00:22:03.890" style="s2">by Lucifer Lucifer is a necessary spirit</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.620" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">it brings us freedom the ermine is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.890" end="00:22:09.000" style="s2">necessary spirit that brings</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.770" style="s2">technical life brings us yeah freedom</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.000" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">from slavery and other things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">not some kind of stupid banal anti anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">good versus evil or anti ecology or any</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:24.030" style="s2">no no no no no absolutely not and he so</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:25.410" style="s2">the Christ spirit stands in between and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.030" end="00:22:28.020" style="s2">he he made a fate you should look it up</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.410" end="00:22:32.220" style="s2">look up when we finished the interview</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.020" end="00:22:34.890" style="s2">look up at Google Google Image Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.220" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">loose for an airman sculpture something</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.890" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">like that and it&#39;ll show up basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:41.160" style="s2">there&#39;s the Lucifer&#39;s larger than life</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:42.270" style="s2">you look as high as his hand up he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.160" end="00:22:43.470" style="s2">like he&#39;s holding it toward her I forget</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.270" end="00:22:44.790" style="s2">and I was like he&#39;s holding a torch or</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.470" end="00:22:47.160" style="s2">something he&#39;s he&#39;s larger than life</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.790" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s like Stalin or something he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.160" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">like enormous yeah and a Nariman is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:57.179" style="s2">almost like a fetus in down and this and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.679" style="s2">and he&#39;s buried he&#39;s underground he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.179" end="00:22:59.580" style="s2">hidden doesn&#39;t want to beat doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.679" end="00:23:03.240" style="s2">to be known doesn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.580" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">recognized so the Lucifer is this self</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.240" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">inflating exaggerated sense of self and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.679" style="s2">the airman even though at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:13.740" style="s2">he&#39;s probably the most powerful force is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.679" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">part of his power is to never take</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.740" end="00:23:19.650" style="s2">credit to be invisible to never to never</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:22.260" style="s2">be exposed of it down underground and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.650" end="00:23:26.520" style="s2">what what the Christ is doing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.260" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">reaching up its compassion for both</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.520" end="00:23:33.090" style="s2">basically reaching up so as to to gently</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:36.170" style="s2">bring Lucifer down and reaching down to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.090" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">Airmen to bring them up so there&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.170" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">necessary it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very tender what</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:45.330" style="s2">Steiners saying about this is it is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:48.410" style="s2">extremely tender approach of they both</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.330" end="00:23:51.750" style="s2">have to be loved in a manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.410" end="00:23:55.320" style="s2">they cannot control you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:57.780" style="s2">beautiful yeah yeah and it&#39;s fats it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.320" end="00:23:59.220" style="s2">fantastic Dioner credits his</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.780" end="00:24:04.890" style="s2">clairvoyance eats not learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.220" end="00:24:07.380" style="s2">read be until use about 12 yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.890" end="00:24:08.429" style="s2">reason it&#39;s kind of well I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.380" end="00:24:12.059" style="s2">been thinking about this lot lately</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.429" end="00:24:14.370" style="s2">reading is I mean I think about I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.059" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">been trying to tie in Gerard with</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.370" end="00:24:20.180" style="s2">Steiner so human language is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:22.850" style="s2">is something that humans own but it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.180" end="00:24:24.860" style="s2">also something distinctly and and we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.850" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">gradually spiritualizing it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.860" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">also something distinctly non-spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:31.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you can&#39;t get more materialist</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:34.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not for nothing that you know or</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.730" end="00:24:37.160" style="s2">Gerard calls it the the single victim</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.220" end="00:24:38.210" style="s2">mechanism it&#39;s it&#39;s really a machine and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.160" end="00:24:40.600" style="s2">they&#39;re making him the making of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.210" end="00:24:43.580" style="s2">language was this cyclical machine and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.600" end="00:24:47.540" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about it which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.580" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">this raw totally godless thing and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.540" end="00:24:52.760" style="s2">and and we are in this process of making</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">it God what&#39;s not us to say about this</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.110" end="00:25:25.670" style="s2">reason why this is so enormous ly</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.990" end="00:25:29.540" style="s2">difficult is because it is the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.670" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">actually well it&#39;s this is related to</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">idea to that we have to create God it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.730" end="00:25:40.610" style="s2">it&#39;s actually enormous ly difficult for</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.610" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">the material and and and and star has</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:50.450" style="s2">not say about this there&#39;s in other</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:54.680" style="s2">words there&#39;s like a war in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.450" end="00:25:56.780" style="s2">heavens and and and we we are players</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.680" end="00:26:01.970" style="s2">but it&#39;s not all isn&#39;t definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.780" end="00:26:03.320" style="s2">all our fault you know but but we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.970" end="00:26:04.670" style="s2">definitely players and the better and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.320" end="00:26:07.100" style="s2">the better we do the better it is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.670" end="00:26:09.050" style="s2">better we perform the better that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.100" end="00:26:12.530" style="s2">know it has enormous implications in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.050" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">the entire spiritual world and our task</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.530" end="00:26:18.040" style="s2">is to spiritualize materialism right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:20.450" style="s2">that&#39;s our task and it&#39;s a quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.040" end="00:26:23.860" style="s2">understand any and he says it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.340" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">so all bullets now the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:35.070" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s I&#39;m working cuz it all</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">blows down so he talks about this all</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.070" end="00:26:38.820" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:40.230" style="s2">Steiner seems to be and this is based on</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.820" end="00:26:42.150" style="s2">his clairvoyance II in other words</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.230" end="00:26:44.010" style="s2">there&#39;s such a thing as going back and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.150" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">finding out exactly what happened this</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.010" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">exists this reality exists so as some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.549" style="s2">them can say so what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">Nietzsche in his in the estate in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.549" end="00:26:57.150" style="s2">I&#39;m on this day you know something</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:26:58.980" style="s2">happened what happened and someone can</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.150" end="00:27:02.309" style="s2">actually a clairvoyant if he has the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.980" end="00:27:05.220" style="s2">powers can go back and and and find out</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.309" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">I mean every every single detail</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.220" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">according to Steiner is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:11.399" style="s2">recorded in the spiritual world and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">can you can access this it&#39;s not excuse</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.399" end="00:27:16.169" style="s2">you know that this is what&#39;s so this</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:22.409" style="s2">stuff is this is crazy this is too crazy</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.169" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">for the average so he can he can find</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.409" end="00:27:28.289" style="s2">stuff out right I mean it&#39;s pretty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.870" end="00:27:30.169" style="s2">pretty nuts he says he says well he knew</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.289" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">Nietzsche he met he knew him person</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.169" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s another story he didn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:40.679" style="s2">says the last two books of Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">I&#39;m digressing here now but the last two</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.679" end="00:27:44.549" style="s2">books of Nietzsche now his mom was</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">getting people then are entirely the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.549" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">works of arimin mmm-hmm a homo was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:53.539" style="s2">name of one and the other is fourth name</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:57.330" style="s2">yeah actually home was a weird book yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.539" end="00:28:00.390" style="s2">anyway so for me to talk about I&#39;m still</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.920" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">the best extra help we can get is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.280" end="00:29:09.410" style="s2">attachment that Gerard has so on my</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.490" end="00:29:18.700" style="s2">related to what Steiner Steiner says his</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.750" end="00:29:49.580" style="s2">why it&#39;s fading rapidly as something</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.670" end="00:29:55.070" style="s2">that has any resonance is because we no</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.580" end="00:29:58.160" style="s2">longer lead that&#39;s the reason and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.070" end="00:30:00.740" style="s2">reason why the Blessed Virgin icon no</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.160" end="00:30:03.830" style="s2">longer carries weight with us is because</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.830" end="00:30:08.990" style="s2">two these two are actually very closely</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.140" end="00:30:19.100" style="s2">something I got going on and and at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.110" end="00:30:22.010" style="s2">same time these are arguably arguably a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.100" end="00:30:26.260" style="s2">weak word I would be I&#39;d like to find a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.010" end="00:30:29.900" style="s2">stronger word these are convincingly</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.260" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">these two events are convincingly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.900" end="00:30:36.770" style="s2">greatest achievements of humanity the</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.070" end="00:30:57.640" style="s2">greatest achievements to them your</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.940" end="00:30:59.290" style="s2">formulation our Gerard is that what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.640" end="00:31:00.670" style="s2">conclusion you&#39;ve come up to come up</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.290" end="00:31:02.620" style="s2">that there are humanity&#39;s greatest</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.670" end="00:31:04.630" style="s2">achievements yeah oh that&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.620" end="00:31:06.430" style="s2">my conclusion yeah yeah no well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.630" end="00:31:07.870" style="s2">what I mean I mean he doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.430" end="00:31:09.820" style="s2">anything about child mortality I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.870" end="00:31:11.080" style="s2">gotten but it&#39;s it&#39;s Jordan Pederson who</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.820" end="00:31:13.030" style="s2">inspired me to think about child</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.080" end="00:31:15.610" style="s2">mortality much more deeply in his in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.030" end="00:31:17.620" style="s2">biblical lecture in brings urgent iconic</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.610" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">talks about it yeah and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.620" end="00:31:21.460" style="s2">just what that seems to be an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:24.010" style="s2">thought it just makes total sense right</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.460" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">yeah yeah these are this and and at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.010" end="00:31:36.030" style="s2">same time these they these two</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:42.370" style="s2">achievements kill the religious impulse</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.030" end="00:31:44.020" style="s2">mm-hmm and and then we are at risk of we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.370" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">so we&#39;re caught in this cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.020" end="00:31:52.330" style="s2">forgetting why how and why we we did</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">this and and how how how we stopped at</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:31:56.950" style="s2">lynching and how we eradicated child</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.490" end="00:32:02.260" style="s2">mortality these are the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:07.270" style="s2">questions and and and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.260" end="00:32:09.790" style="s2">a you know the they they there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.270" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">in which solving a great problem creates</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.790" end="00:32:15.730" style="s2">a great creates another great problem so</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:19.540" style="s2">you when you the minute you stop</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.730" end="00:32:21.340" style="s2">lynching is the minute you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.540" end="00:32:24.160" style="s2">released yourself from you have nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.340" end="00:32:26.230" style="s2">bomb suddenly maybe I don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.160" end="00:32:27.370" style="s2">yeah or the minute you stop the minute</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:28.780" style="s2">you run out of ketchup mentality is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.370" end="00:32:30.610" style="s2">minute is the minute that population</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.780" end="00:32:33.220" style="s2">became a huge issue overpopulation right</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.610" end="00:32:35.590" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s the exact same problem and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.220" end="00:32:38.980" style="s2">so an area are now completely you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.590" end="00:32:43.060" style="s2">cotton throes of population problems but</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.980" end="00:32:47.050" style="s2">let&#39;s not you know and this in at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:50.260" style="s2">you know at the same time to go back in</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.050" end="00:32:52.840" style="s2">time and wish to not eradicate all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:58.210" style="s2">kids just they it&#39;s not is inconceivable</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:33:01.090" style="s2">right so so basically that to me is is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.210" end="00:33:03.490" style="s2">real argument about it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.090" end="00:33:05.170" style="s2">like the new it&#39;s the new crux it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.490" end="00:33:06.400" style="s2">new cross that we have to bear we</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.170" end="00:33:10.450" style="s2">Westerners have to bury we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.400" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">reflect on those two things and we if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.450" end="00:33:13.810" style="s2">don&#39;t then we will never understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:15.300" style="s2">ourselves with those are the two most</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:18.520" style="s2">important things to reflect upon the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.300" end="00:33:22.390" style="s2">stopping of lynching and the eradication</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:25.960" style="s2">of child mortality and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.390" end="00:33:27.640" style="s2">return to to those symbols I I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.960" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">that I believe that those symbols will</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.640" end="00:33:31.000" style="s2">be important again in 50 or on a year&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.670" style="s2">time and not that I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.000" end="00:33:34.870" style="s2">either but that we you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.670" end="00:33:36.730" style="s2">arrive at a deeper level of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.870" end="00:33:38.410" style="s2">understanding so that we can a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.730" end="00:33:40.540" style="s2">under level of understanding of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.410" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">symbols yeah yeah something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.540" end="00:33:45.640" style="s2">hmm and so this is kind of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:46.900" style="s2">we&#39;re at the this is the questions of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.640" end="00:33:49.150" style="s2">Western identity right there in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:51.730" style="s2">nutshell and so the other words there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.150" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">like a dyad the cross and the end the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.730" end="00:33:58.060" style="s2">Virgin the person icon they constitute a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">diet and this is the West it is the West</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.060" end="00:34:03.580" style="s2">moving period and it&#39;s it&#39;s responsible</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.710" style="s2">for the development of machines and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.580" end="00:34:07.930" style="s2">know they&#39;re in all these cures and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.710" end="00:34:10.390" style="s2">responsible for all kinds of wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.930" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">things that we have and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.390" end="00:34:17.500" style="s2">horrible things that we have thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:18.880" style="s2">about I&#39;ve been thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.500" end="00:34:20.890" style="s2">symbol of the cross the Christian cross</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.880" end="00:34:24.670" style="s2">and contrasting with the symbol of you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.890" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">know symbol of let&#39;s say of tourism</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.670" end="00:34:28.120" style="s2">which is very it&#39;s a secret symbol right</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:30.580" style="s2">and it looks like a cross except it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.120" end="00:34:33.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a man and women and in sexual union</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.580" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s the symbol right so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.250" end="00:34:36.970" style="s2">so that you have the symbol of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:39.100" style="s2">sort of pain and suffering and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.970" end="00:34:41.890" style="s2">have this other symbol of ultimate kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.100" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">of Union and Christianity will always be</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.890" end="00:34:46.390" style="s2">there but we&#39;re moving maybe into an age</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:48.730" style="s2">of the those two kind of being together</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.390" end="00:34:50.770" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s it&#39;s a very vague</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.730" end="00:34:53.380" style="s2">speculative you know kind of thought but</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.770" end="00:34:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s sexuality in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.380" end="00:34:57.700" style="s2">sense it&#39;s not sexuality in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.360" end="00:34:59.530" style="s2">just pleasure at sexuality in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.700" end="00:35:01.990" style="s2">form and emptiness coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.530" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">then disappearing you know I totally</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.990" end="00:35:08.140" style="s2">believe that sexuality is a spirit a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:09.460" style="s2">form of spiritual enlightenment but what</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.510" end="00:39:16.550" style="s2">have an idea of how that actually works</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.070" end="00:39:19.640" style="s2">and in other words how the universal</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.550" end="00:39:23.690" style="s2">male and female make love and and how</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.640" end="00:39:25.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the the task at hand and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.690" end="00:39:27.320" style="s2">really has doesn&#39;t have much to do with</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.190" end="00:39:29.480" style="s2">sex it has more to do does the actual</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.480" end="00:39:32.670" style="s2">more to do with what people do with</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.339" end="00:39:47.130" style="s2">male it seems to me it seemed his death</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.130" end="00:39:51.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a con of a there&#39;s a dimension</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.130" end="00:39:53.220" style="s2">of desperation in the male he you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.809" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">become you know palea talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.220" end="00:39:58.200" style="s2">most clearly she says men have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">desperate obsession with us identity</p>

<p begin="00:42:16.370" end="00:42:22.890" style="s2">well I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s such a cliche</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:25.410" style="s2">I mean the you look at the the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.890" end="00:42:28.230" style="s2">charismatic movie stars and you put them</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.620" end="00:42:57.240" style="s2">terrible and and there seems to be some</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.040" end="00:42:58.470" style="s2">kind of a learning process going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.240" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">there so that&#39;s fine in other words</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.470" end="00:43:02.730" style="s2">they&#39;re in hell to learn something you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:04.110" style="s2">know and I see that it&#39;s good everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.730" end="00:43:06.420" style="s2">you know everybody has to suffer in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.110" end="00:43:07.830" style="s2">order learns the latter&#39;s better so</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.420" end="00:43:10.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of and that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.830" end="00:43:11.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not a certain shadow sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.110" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a feature of sexual you know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.670" end="00:43:16.890" style="s2">hard dark suffering learning from sexual</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:19.140" style="s2">you know that&#39;s fine that&#39;s good with</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.890" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2">that but in terms and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.140" end="00:43:24.180" style="s2">thing so I really very attracted</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:27.210" style="s2">civilization as as man loving woman and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:30.210" style="s2">you know it&#39;s gonna have to it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.210" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">be a while before and women we only need</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.210" end="00:43:35.540" style="s2">to celebrate they really need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:38.600" style="s2">celebrate men in that regard instead of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.540" end="00:43:41.130" style="s2">interpreting it as some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.600" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">exclusion of women this is a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.130" end="00:43:45.540" style="s2">terrible mistake</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.020" end="00:43:52.080" style="s2">yeah well justice resentful attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.540" end="00:43:55.770" style="s2">so so so miserable so I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.080" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">that symbol of man loving woman yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.770" end="00:44:00.510" style="s2">terms of it being the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:02.190" style="s2">human experience and it&#39;s also it also I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.510" end="00:44:04.349" style="s2">was thinking it is the cross in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.190" end="00:44:07.049" style="s2">sense to as well I don&#39;t know how to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.349" end="00:44:10.309" style="s2">that the I&#39;ve been working really hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.049" end="00:44:12.030" style="s2">this past year I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.309" end="00:44:15.960" style="s2">what he just said</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.030" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">and I have a whole other take so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.960" end="00:44:23.579" style="s2">virgin virgin icon is an image of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:26.490" style="s2">young woman with a baby in her arms and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.579" end="00:44:35.220" style="s2">she has a snake a turkey under her feet</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.490" end="00:44:36.650" style="s2">and she is protecting the babe from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.220" end="00:44:39.180" style="s2">snake</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.650" end="00:44:40.829" style="s2">now what Jordan Pederson says about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.180" end="00:44:46.410" style="s2">was totally completely fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.829" end="00:44:48.030" style="s2">because she more often than not loses in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.410" end="00:44:51.299" style="s2">the battle with the snake so the snake</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.030" end="00:44:52.559" style="s2">wins and I think you know this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.299" end="00:44:54.990" style="s2">number it could be a wrong number but</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.559" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">the number is 80% 80% child mortality</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.990" end="00:45:02.099" style="s2">rates prior to the 20th century maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:06.170" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong but so she mostly lost in</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.099" end="00:45:09.890" style="s2">her battle with the snake and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.170" end="00:45:12.660" style="s2">therefore she learned in an</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.890" end="00:45:14.780" style="s2">overwhelmingly overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.660" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">in an overwhelming way she learned</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.780" end="00:45:23.130" style="s2">exactly what it means to lose what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:24.869" style="s2">most dear to her mm-hmm I&#39;m digressing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.130" end="00:45:25.799" style="s2">actually talking about list I was going</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.869" end="00:45:30.180" style="s2">to talk about something else but anyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.799" end="00:45:36.900" style="s2">any she and in that process she learns</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.180" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">how to sin because that&#39;s what female</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:41.309" style="s2">sin is understanding what is most dear</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">to another give you something but</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.309" end="00:45:46.740" style="s2">anything at all and removing it from</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:48.270" style="s2">them not allowing them to possess it</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.740" end="00:45:53.069" style="s2">whether it&#39;s psychological or physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.270" end="00:45:56.130" style="s2">or anything and this is a female sin</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.069" end="00:45:59.099" style="s2">like male female sin is something much</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.130" end="00:46:00.990" style="s2">more basic it&#39;s it&#39;s closer to you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.099" end="00:46:04.950" style="s2">rape pillage and plunder or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.990" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">like that it&#39;s it&#39;s more it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.950" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">no less serious but it it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:11.579" style="s2">not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:14.999" style="s2">subtle doesn&#39;t have that anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.579" end="00:46:16.680" style="s2">the subtlety and so so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.999" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2">but well this is what I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.680" end="00:46:24.049" style="s2">this definition of female sin is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.150" end="00:46:28.279" style="s2">extremely beautiful because it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.049" end="00:46:32.009" style="s2">instantly forgivable because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.279" end="00:46:37.619" style="s2">recognizing its source oh that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.009" end="00:46:39.539" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s the source that&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.619" end="00:46:41.640" style="s2">recognising its source can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.539" end="00:46:45.269" style="s2">as a child how high child mortality you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.640" end="00:46:49.170" style="s2">know going back going back forever</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.269" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">oh and so and this is her this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.170" end="00:46:53.910" style="s2">the baggage so why would she want why</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:58.219" style="s2">would she want to to sin because of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.910" end="00:47:01.559" style="s2">I&#39;m not well it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s been it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.219" end="00:47:03.949" style="s2">been it&#39;s learned deeply learned</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.559" end="00:47:06.719" style="s2">behavior culturally inherited it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.949" end="00:47:08.789" style="s2">hurt and she wants to hurt back is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.719" end="00:47:10.619" style="s2">well I mean yeah if there&#39;s a you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.789" end="00:47:12.359" style="s2">mean everybody since right who who hell</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.619" end="00:47:14.579" style="s2">knows why we got them sin I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.359" end="00:47:16.469" style="s2">what I mean that that&#39;s the in other</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.579" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">words the source of it is so utterly</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.469" end="00:47:22.469" style="s2">clear and so so understandable it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:24.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s so overwhelmingly it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.469" end="00:47:26.430" style="s2">overwhelmingly powerful source you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.690" end="00:47:28.650" style="s2">deal with your grief your grief is</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.430" end="00:47:32.609" style="s2">overwhelming you completely understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.650" end="00:47:36.119" style="s2">what it is and then you for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.609" end="00:47:38.699" style="s2">reason have designs on another to to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.119" end="00:47:42.089" style="s2">inflict similar to a similar pain upon</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.699" end="00:47:45.449" style="s2">another and that that there it is right</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.089" end="00:47:50.099" style="s2">there that&#39;s the source now the male</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.449" end="00:47:52.709" style="s2">source male source is here here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.099" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">is this is this is a crazy theory so so</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.709" end="00:47:58.589" style="s2">I want to develop this this week by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:48:00.029" style="s2">way I&#39;m really excited about this male</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.589" end="00:48:02.099" style="s2">source of sin okay here we go</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.029" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">well not only that so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.099" end="00:48:07.380" style="s2">version icon is the ultimate symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:10.619" style="s2">female right what&#39;s the ultimate symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.380" end="00:48:14.849" style="s2">of male it&#39;s not the cross no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.619" end="00:48:17.130" style="s2">phallic it&#39;s oh no it isn&#39;t no that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.670" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">thinking there I had to give that more</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.140" end="00:48:31.350" style="s2">thought I was thinking about all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:34.530" style="s2">coats of arms it being so male male</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.350" end="00:48:36.840" style="s2">ultimate males isn&#39;t is not the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.530" end="00:48:40.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not a sexual symbol it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.840" end="00:48:45.150" style="s2">it&#39;s sovereignty it&#39;s the ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.760" end="00:48:49.770" style="s2">to be strong in a sovereign way to be to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.150" end="00:48:52.740" style="s2">protect and basically sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.770" end="00:48:55.140" style="s2">totally a projection of female of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.740" end="00:48:57.120" style="s2">female projection of men it&#39;s a product</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.140" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">of female projection of men women are</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.120" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">attracted to men who partake mostly of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:04.830" style="s2">sovereignty their mote that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:07.080" style="s2">basically that it&#39;s the height of female</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.830" end="00:49:07.740" style="s2">attraction to men is it falls into that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.080" end="00:49:09.810" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.740" end="00:49:12.150" style="s2">he&#39;s either it could be something very</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.810" end="00:49:14.490" style="s2">basic like he&#39;s big he&#39;s strong he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:31.380" style="s2">much to do with sovereignty and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.710" end="00:49:34.200" style="s2">what attracts women the most and the it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.380" end="00:49:36.450" style="s2">is a very exclusive criterion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.200" end="00:49:38.520" style="s2">Attraction in other words that most most</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.450" end="00:49:41.090" style="s2">men don&#39;t actually don&#39;t really fit into</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.520" end="00:49:45.150" style="s2">that most men aren&#39;t very good at</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.090" end="00:49:51.030" style="s2">fitting into that hierarchy and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.150" end="00:49:54.030" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty exclusive so the my view is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.030" end="00:49:59.460" style="s2">that the ultimate symbol of the male</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.030" end="00:50:01.950" style="s2">principle is also the version I can okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:04.500" style="s2">because really her attraction or</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.950" end="00:50:07.500" style="s2">attraction has to do with the survival</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.500" end="00:50:10.290" style="s2">of that baby and so the male the male</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.500" end="00:50:12.180" style="s2">she chooses is of ultimate importance</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.290" end="00:50:14.310" style="s2">for the survival of that baby so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.180" end="00:50:17.550" style="s2">survival of the baby is the man is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.310" end="00:50:19.260" style="s2">prayer is the the big strong bond is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.550" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">female projection of the survival of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.260" end="00:50:23.910" style="s2">that baby is the is the female</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:26.820" style="s2">projection of man in its relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.910" end="00:50:29.450" style="s2">survival of the baby so it&#39;s all its</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.820" end="00:50:33.150" style="s2">based and the cross is basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.450" end="00:50:34.690" style="s2">something that has to do with crazy</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.150" end="00:50:37.090" style="s2">imitative</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.690" end="00:50:39.250" style="s2">behavior which really has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.090" end="00:50:41.620" style="s2">sexual frustration has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.250" end="00:50:45.250" style="s2">the whole whole bunch a whole crowd who</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.620" end="00:50:47.290" style="s2">are excluded from this is so this great</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.250" end="00:50:49.750" style="s2">theory that sexual marginal marginal</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.290" end="00:50:52.060" style="s2">person or the this twentieth-century</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.750" end="00:50:57.010" style="s2">popular theory that sexual consummation</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.060" end="00:50:59.230" style="s2">is is a is a great antidote to violence</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.010" end="00:51:00.340" style="s2">is a three it convincing theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.230" end="00:51:05.140" style="s2">just that most lots of people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.340" end="00:51:07.420" style="s2">excluded from it so so and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.140" end="00:51:09.730" style="s2">think the cross is really a it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.420" end="00:51:11.830" style="s2">like there&#39;s I see now I this is only it</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.730" end="00:51:14.440" style="s2">this this there is only a few days old</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.830" end="00:51:19.270" style="s2">it&#39;s only this past week I see human</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:22.750" style="s2">especially the Western diet as sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.270" end="00:51:26.170" style="s2">the Virgin mmm-hmm which includes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.750" end="00:51:28.690" style="s2">men who are engaged in that sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.170" end="00:51:31.360" style="s2">and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.690" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">I mean flavors in other or the abolition</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.360" end="00:51:37.630" style="s2">of slavery is another biggie in in in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:41.830" style="s2">recent recent centuries which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.630" end="00:51:45.100" style="s2">amazing how how on how badly analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.830" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">how badly presented understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.100" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">that it&#39;s amazing how poorly we</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.540" end="00:51:51.550" style="s2">understand these things slavery the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:54.120" style="s2">eradication of child mortality and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.550" end="00:51:58.510" style="s2">the the stopping of lynching it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.120" end="00:52:00.580" style="s2">just knocked me over how we we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.510" end="00:52:01.410" style="s2">we kind of don&#39;t think of it as all that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.580" end="00:52:04.690" style="s2">important or something</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.410" end="00:52:06.310" style="s2">we&#39;re so forgetful and in part I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.690" end="00:52:08.890" style="s2">part of the reason is we&#39;re engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.310" end="00:52:11.020" style="s2">deliberate if we really thought about</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.890" end="00:52:13.570" style="s2">them will be forced to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.020" end="00:52:15.850" style="s2">deeper cultural source but we we have an</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.570" end="00:52:18.310" style="s2">ideological blind spot which tells us we</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.850" end="00:52:21.670" style="s2">cannot acknowledge that cultural source</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.310" end="00:52:25.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a profound ideological</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.670" end="00:52:27.700" style="s2">driving us to deny that the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.480" end="00:52:29.800" style="s2">source of our Western experience in</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:32.890" style="s2">other words well how do how do we a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.800" end="00:52:34.950" style="s2">stopped lynching how how did we abolish</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.890" end="00:52:40.180" style="s2">slavery if you ask those basic questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.950" end="00:52:42.070" style="s2">deeply you would you would arrive at you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.180" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">draw the Christianity you arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.070" end="00:52:49.270" style="s2">Christianity and and people have a mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:53.140" style="s2">a mental block to that and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.270" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">they don&#39;t go there well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.140" end="00:52:56.890" style="s2">cause of this mental block that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.550" end="00:52:58.420" style="s2">why do people I mean I have my Bibble</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.890" end="00:53:02.410" style="s2">and feelings towards Christianity as</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.420" end="00:53:04.180" style="s2">well I just meant what why I mean I am a</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.410" end="00:53:06.310" style="s2">Christian but I mean it&#39;s not like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.180" end="00:53:13.300" style="s2">think we all became Christians than the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.310" end="00:53:18.520" style="s2">world be all right so much Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.300" end="00:53:20.770" style="s2">around - well if it weren&#39;t for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.520" end="00:53:24.550" style="s2">Midwest western United States Bible Belt</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.770" end="00:53:27.310" style="s2">and all their madness Christianity in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.550" end="00:53:30.310" style="s2">the West I&#39;ll be totally dead its car</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.310" end="00:53:32.200" style="s2">under the final engine of Christianity I</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.310" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">suppose you could talk about I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.200" end="00:53:36.010" style="s2">I when I went to st. Paul&#39;s Cathedral in</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:38.320" style="s2">London I was I was looking at dead</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.010" end="00:53:39.849" style="s2">Christianity because there was no there</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.320" end="00:53:41.950" style="s2">was nothing there it was just nothing</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.849" end="00:53:45.070" style="s2">there it was very interesting to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.950" end="00:53:47.260" style="s2">like you know I if I go in if I go in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.070" end="00:53:48.820" style="s2">little Catholic Church up the street</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.260" end="00:53:51.400" style="s2">from bi there&#39;s still something there</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.820" end="00:53:53.980" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this great need for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.400" end="00:53:56.859" style="s2">counter a counter or forced to jar us</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.980" end="00:54:00.940" style="s2">out of this this total this utter lack</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.859" end="00:54:02.859" style="s2">of open ability to step two to access</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.940" end="00:54:05.980" style="s2">any clairvoyant see this is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.859" end="00:54:08.920" style="s2">Steiners argument for the necessity of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.980" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">Christian intervention it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.920" end="00:54:13.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a fascinating thing and he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:17.020" style="s2">that the 20th century would see a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:21.460" style="s2">gradual return this one this century and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.020" end="00:54:24.609" style="s2">beyond there will be a think an increase</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.460" end="00:54:26.980" style="s2">in clairvoyance E and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.609" end="00:54:29.170" style="s2">exciting but nonetheless there&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.980" end="00:54:31.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this terrible counter force at</p>
