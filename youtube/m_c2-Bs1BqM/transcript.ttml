<p begin="00:00:05.120" end="00:00:09.719" style="s2">as this crisis unfolds we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.859" end="00:00:11.639" style="s2">started looking at different ways we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.719" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">start and try to make sense of it we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:15.570" style="s2">looked at complexity and now in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">film we&#39;re looking at mythopoetic s--</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.570" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">and this is a subject really close to my</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">heart because I&#39;m a writer and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">always been fascinated by myth and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">idea that myth can teach us something</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">about being human and how to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">world that we can&#39;t really get from</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">anywhere else so I&#39;m fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.340" end="00:00:36.420" style="s2">looking at myth is almost like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">hidden code in the stories we tell this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:39.270" style="s2">is one of the really interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">about looking at things through a mythic</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.270" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">lens is that stories and structures of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">stories repeat over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">right now when we&#39;re in a crisis like</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">this and everything is uncertain myth is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">really coming into its own as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">start to make sense so I spoke to three</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.010" style="s2">people whose work I really admire in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">this area and they were Zach Stein who</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.010" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">is a psychologist and also an education</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">reformer and he wrote this brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">piece recently called</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">a war in heaven were on a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">journey yeah worth a couple lifetimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">like it&#39;s very intense but I think at</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">this point it&#39;s it&#39;s less like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:23.189" style="s2">a map and we know where we&#39;re going and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.710" end="00:01:25.670" style="s2">more like again to use another image of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">from biblical myth it&#39;s like wandering</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.670" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">in the wilderness together this is where</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">we are I wanted to speak to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">is an expert on on death and dying and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">our cultural attitudes towards that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t think of anyone better than</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">Stephen Jenkinson who is I used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:44.149" style="s2">palliative care counselor and worked in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">a large hospital in North America and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.149" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">was with thousands and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">people as they died so Stephen Jenkinson</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">has written a lot about how a person can</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">die well and I was curious to ask him</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">about how does a culture die well again</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">I learned this thing at the district so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:04.800" style="s2">you really love somebody who&#39;s dying yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:08.040" style="s2">do you think they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.800" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">do they refuse to be dying or are they</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.040" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">dying because the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">question determines what you do next so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">let&#39;s say they&#39;re dying they don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:19.220" style="s2">that they are but they are they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">the early stages of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.220" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">what is the etiquette of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">relationship with them how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">conduct yourself as if what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:32.070" style="s2">is happening that becomes the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">for a dying person in your household and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.070" end="00:02:37.770" style="s2">it becomes the same question for a time</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:41.910" style="s2">like now where we get to glimpse how</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.770" end="00:02:44.490" style="s2">utterly exhausted our acquisitive way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.910" end="00:02:46.770" style="s2">doing things has become so I also spoke</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.490" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">to Charlotte akan and Charlotte is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.770" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">writer and a storyteller she&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">the editors of the dark mountain project</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:56.520" style="s2">which is a publication that like rebel</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">wisdom explores systemic fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.520" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">explores the kind of mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.130" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">substructure of of culture as well you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">know you can live up here with it as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">story and it isn&#39;t lived but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">are being absolutely I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:12.209" style="s2">that&#39;s how they were written and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we need to do it I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.209" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">think we need to embody so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">something we&#39;ve been looking at since</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">the beginning of the channel like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:22.380" style="s2">are the deep stories of culture trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">to tell us from Jordan Pederson looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.380" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">at kind of the deep source code of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">Bible and pre-biblical</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">knowledge to I think the the best that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">heard was Jordan Hall summarized it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">one of our interviews where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">about the mythopoetic layer being the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">place where we put knowledge that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.930" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">might only need once a generation or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">once a millennium this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is I think most clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">trying to articulate in their space you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">know our archetypes our mythologies the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">ones that cover a lot of cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">lasts a long time do so because they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:57.020" style="s2">the things that have been most deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">associated with what is worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.020" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">those cultures that do certain things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">certain ways endure and we perceive them</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:06.450" style="s2">as stories so we can we can listen to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:08.280" style="s2">them but it&#39;s not the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.450" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">matters the embodied practices if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.280" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">not living it you&#39;re not doing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">religious aspect where would you store</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">that information or you&#39;d store it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">the deep in the deep mythopoetic layer</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:17.829" style="s2">and the stories that underpin the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:19.599" style="s2">culture so</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.829" end="00:04:21.819" style="s2">this really feels like a time where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.599" end="00:04:24.189" style="s2">should be going into that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.819" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">mythopoetic layer and pulling out what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.189" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">what has been stored there by our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:30.879" style="s2">ancestors for the times that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:32.349" style="s2">through now there are also a few themes</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.879" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">that really came out as I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.349" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">people and so the first one is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:42.219" style="s2">of the liminal the liminal means that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.770" end="00:04:43.960" style="s2">space between and Zach Stein he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.219" end="00:04:45.250" style="s2">that that space between worlds which i</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.960" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">think is a really nice way to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.250" end="00:04:50.229" style="s2">it and the liminal is a weird place in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:51.849" style="s2">myth because we step past some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.229" end="00:04:53.379" style="s2">threshold that&#39;s interesting that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.849" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">at threshold actually comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.379" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">from doorway that&#39;s the doorway and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">have actually done that as specie if</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve stepped through our doorways into</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:03.449" style="s2">a place that&#39;s very familiar to us our</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:06.129" style="s2">homes but in this insanely unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.449" end="00:05:08.919" style="s2">situation so you step past the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.129" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">and then you&#39;re in this world that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.919" end="00:05:12.279" style="s2">sort of between things you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:14.050" style="s2">stranger things that&#39;s the upside down</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.279" end="00:05:16.509" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of like our world but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.050" end="00:05:19.419" style="s2">it&#39;s all inverted the rules that used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.509" end="00:05:21.159" style="s2">apply didn&#39;t apply and Zach Stein really</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.419" end="00:05:22.750" style="s2">spoke of this really beautifully so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.159" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">gonna play a clip of where he goes into</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:27.969" style="s2">it in a bit more detail what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">what&#39;s your sense on what that space</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.969" end="00:05:31.779" style="s2">means psychologically or mythically like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:35.430" style="s2">what what does it really mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.779" end="00:05:41.319" style="s2">right now in a space between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.430" end="00:05:43.089" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s disorienting</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.319" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing it&#39;s a storage</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.089" end="00:05:47.589" style="s2">again scary and this is like when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t remember I said like once you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.589" end="00:05:51.659" style="s2">reach a certain age it becomes hard to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">die to yourself and create it yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.659" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">one of the main reasons for that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:06:00.039" style="s2">because of the disorientation and fear</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:02.949" style="s2">that sets in when one world is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.039" end="00:06:08.289" style="s2">the world and another world hasn&#39;t set</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.949" end="00:06:12.969" style="s2">in and you know so the experience is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.289" end="00:06:17.699" style="s2">of being on unmoored and seeking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.969" end="00:06:22.089" style="s2">some deeper root than the superficial</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.699" end="00:06:24.129" style="s2">things that were grounding you and so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.089" end="00:06:26.090" style="s2">is both a feeling of disorientation and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.129" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">a feeling of grasping one</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.090" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">or imagining right and and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:35.030" style="s2">place where though kind of metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:39.500" style="s2">the war of Heaven comes in because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.030" end="00:06:41.930" style="s2">in that opening of imagination where</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.500" end="00:06:45.830" style="s2">there&#39;s this battle between the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.930" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">different kind of voices and archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.830" end="00:06:51.470" style="s2">that populate the human psyche but when</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:53.389" style="s2">the world&#39;s just running heaven stays</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.470" end="00:06:54.830" style="s2">put right and there&#39;s a fan of season we</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.389" end="00:06:57.940" style="s2">watched them on TV about what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.830" end="00:07:00.470" style="s2">happen like but when the world starts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.940" end="00:07:03.830" style="s2">shift and change radically</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:06.350" style="s2">then you heaven and earth kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.830" end="00:07:09.380" style="s2">collide and in your own imagination you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.350" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">start to see possibilities in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">world that look hellish or heaven like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:16.810" style="s2">right and this is what we&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:19.970" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s imagination is going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.810" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">the possibility of worst-case these</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.970" end="00:07:23.240" style="s2">terrible things that you who wish</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:25.100" style="s2">thought you&#39;d only ever see on a movie</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.240" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">now all of a sudden are like flooding</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.100" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">into your actual experience things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:33.380" style="s2">were mythic in the sense of being like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:35.870" style="s2">myth that you watch on the screen are</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.380" end="00:07:37.789" style="s2">now like playing out in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.870" end="00:07:40.940" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this the heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.789" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">earth collide and similarly other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.940" end="00:07:45.289" style="s2">are saying this the possibility for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:47.690" style="s2">radical positivity to come out of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.289" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2">on the other end right then out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.690" end="00:07:53.539" style="s2">moment in response to tragedy and pain</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:57.770" style="s2">when utopia could be forged right and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.539" end="00:07:59.600" style="s2">again like heaven this fantasy of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.770" end="00:08:01.430" style="s2">completely different economic system</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.600" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">like this fantasy which would stop the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.430" end="00:08:04.250" style="s2">capitalist world system with a button</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2">and every one thing grinds to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.250" end="00:08:09.410" style="s2">wait a second that just happened right</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:11.479" style="s2">so it&#39;s like heaven and earth collide</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.410" end="00:08:15.080" style="s2">again and there&#39;s this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.479" end="00:08:19.460" style="s2">imaginal potency which makes the choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.080" end="00:08:22.580" style="s2">the feeling of choice dizzying because</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.460" end="00:08:24.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know are you gonna turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.580" end="00:08:28.610" style="s2">into a bad guy or you&#39;re gonna turn into</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.770" end="00:08:29.810" style="s2">a hero right usually you don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.610" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">to ask that question because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.810" end="00:08:35.000" style="s2">afraid you as a guy but now depending</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:37.270" style="s2">what happens would the way this plays</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.000" end="00:08:39.880" style="s2">out you may have to choose between</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.270" end="00:08:41.650" style="s2">in being a villain being a hero right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.880" end="00:08:43.540" style="s2">acting how to complete selfishness to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.650" end="00:08:46.450" style="s2">protect yourself or giving of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.540" end="00:08:49.780" style="s2">to help others right yo there will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.450" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">the opportunity to make real choices</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.780" end="00:08:55.840" style="s2">that affect character and and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.360" style="s2">the other thing that happens between</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.840" end="00:08:59.950" style="s2">worlds is that I think there&#39;s a line in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.360" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">the paper I say you know precious are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.950" end="00:09:04.810" style="s2">the moments of world making and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:06.070" style="s2">the case in your own life when you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.810" end="00:09:09.370" style="s2">you&#39;re in between and you&#39;re at those</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.070" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">critical choice points right when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.370" end="00:09:15.430" style="s2">relationships end when jobs and people</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:17.290" style="s2">die when health crises hits you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.430" end="00:09:20.530" style="s2">that in those moments the choices you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.290" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">make are more pronounced because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.530" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">at the beginning of a new fork in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:32.050" style="s2">road yes of the time between worlds also</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">feels ethically charged feels like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.050" end="00:09:39.640" style="s2">moments are more important what do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">do with your time matters more and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.640" end="00:09:42.910" style="s2">was speaking to Vega yesterday and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">were just where&#39;s the day before and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.910" end="00:09:48.070" style="s2">were going on this notion of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:50.580" style="s2">right that it&#39;s this potency time this</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.070" end="00:09:52.630" style="s2">pregnant time the time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.580" end="00:09:54.820" style="s2">which again is not a good - it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.630" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">like happy time it&#39;s not like yay you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:09:58.870" style="s2">know it&#39;s not at all like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:05.260" style="s2">actually quite scary and terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.870" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">um but also again part of that part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.260" end="00:10:08.140" style="s2">human experience so we are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.060" end="00:10:10.630" style="s2">something that although it&#39;s nominal</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.140" end="00:10:12.670" style="s2">humans experience this like this is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.630" end="00:10:17.050" style="s2">humans have since we&#39;ve been humans</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.670" end="00:10:19.450" style="s2">experienced the sense of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.050" end="00:10:22.120" style="s2">system we&#39;re all in it together and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.450" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">whole system something&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.120" end="00:10:24.970" style="s2">like again the flood myth like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">what that story&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.970" end="00:10:28.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh my god a flood is coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:30.130" style="s2">like we used to be not friends and like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.870" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">battling and like there&#39;s all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.130" end="00:10:35.130" style="s2">happening before this but now this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:38.260" style="s2">happening and just overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">collective kind of opening of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.260" end="00:10:44.770" style="s2">towards fear towards love right the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:47.800" style="s2">more energy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.770" end="00:10:51.520" style="s2">kind of like dynamics in the mind and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.800" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">the culture so yeah that that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.520" end="00:10:55.210" style="s2">feels like a little bit to be Minotaur</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:59.010" style="s2">between worlds for those who would see</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.210" end="00:11:01.930" style="s2">this this crisis as terrible as it is as</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.010" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">simultaneously a call to adventure where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.930" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">that adventure might be towards maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:09.160" style="s2">every individuals will be different but</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:12.910" style="s2">do you think without obviously asking</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.160" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">you to map out the future well is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.910" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">some kind of a tractor that you feel we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:17.940" style="s2">might be moving towards as we as we move</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:21.280" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.940" end="00:11:22.450" style="s2">interesting the adventure is not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.280" end="00:11:23.740" style="s2">were I don&#39;t think adventures the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.450" end="00:11:25.480" style="s2">that I use that I wouldn&#39;t use the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.740" end="00:11:28.750" style="s2">adventure it&#39;s it&#39;s not an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.480" end="00:11:33.180" style="s2">it&#39;s more like a potentially ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.750" end="00:11:37.450" style="s2">ordeal right that it&#39;s a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.180" end="00:11:42.460" style="s2">beautiful tragedy or redemptive tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.450" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">um but you know there&#39;s a crucifixion</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.460" end="00:11:52.210" style="s2">before the resurrection and hurts so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.260" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">kind of journey that were on is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.210" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">journey that we have sketched out a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:56.140" style="s2">little bit he writes this journey into</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:12:00.250" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.140" end="00:12:02.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a journey into depth and into</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.250" end="00:12:05.080" style="s2">intimacy and relationship unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.590" end="00:12:06.760" style="s2">physical close proximity although you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.080" end="00:12:09.190" style="s2">will be perhaps locked in a house with</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.760" end="00:12:11.650" style="s2">people for a while but a deepening of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.190" end="00:12:14.200" style="s2">intimacy because you know every phone</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.650" end="00:12:16.810" style="s2">call you have could go there you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.200" end="00:12:19.690" style="s2">what I mean it&#39;s like it&#39;s gonna be hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.810" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">to keep pretense of normalcy Emma that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.690" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">means that we&#39;re all open to the depths</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">of one another so we&#39;re on an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:32.340" style="s2">in - yeah it&#39;s like a for a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:37.210" style="s2">sounding cheesy and like a soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.340" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">adventure it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">journey of deepening in Solman of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">individual and species and you know when</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:50.500" style="s2">you think of that notion of in Solman</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.000" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a term I use technically and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">another conversation but tragedy is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">structure of insulting a pain right</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:13:00.250" style="s2">depth and the grappling and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:04.390" style="s2">employment with others rather than</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:06.490" style="s2">separation with others so yeah in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.390" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2">sense the immediacy of it&#39;s it&#39;s a side</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.490" end="00:13:11.320" style="s2">we&#39;re on a we&#39;re on a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:15.220" style="s2">journey yeah it&#39;s worth a couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.320" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">lifetimes like it&#39;s very intense and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.220" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">then there will be changes physically</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:23.500" style="s2">like to commodities supply change to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:29.410" style="s2">economics and so there will be a a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.500" end="00:13:32.440" style="s2">social economic journey basically but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.410" end="00:13:33.820" style="s2">think at this point it&#39;s it&#39;s less like</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.440" end="00:13:37.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a map and we know where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.820" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">going and more like again to use another</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.500" end="00:13:44.020" style="s2">image of from biblical myth it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:47.620" style="s2">wandering in the wilderness together</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.020" end="00:13:50.530" style="s2">this is where we are and so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.620" end="00:13:53.080" style="s2">in the wilderness you have to bring your</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.530" end="00:13:56.200" style="s2">temple with you right it becomes not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.080" end="00:13:58.540" style="s2">temple in space but a temple in time and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.200" end="00:14:00.520" style="s2">it allows you even though you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:03.790" style="s2">exactly where you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.520" end="00:14:08.890" style="s2">together um all right in that shared</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.790" end="00:14:12.670" style="s2">container of meaning and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.890" end="00:14:17.200" style="s2">sense yeah we&#39;re on that pilgrimage our</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.670" end="00:14:19.150" style="s2">wandering through the wilderness and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.200" end="00:14:21.640" style="s2">I&#39;m arguing not arguing I&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.150" end="00:14:23.410" style="s2">pleading for is that we remember to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.640" end="00:14:28.030" style="s2">create these temples in time where we</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.410" end="00:14:31.810" style="s2">can be together in reality no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.030" end="00:14:34.210" style="s2">bad it gets and know that it this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.810" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">what humans have always done in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.210" end="00:14:42.640" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like what we&#39;re made for is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:47.770" style="s2">to experience the intense and tragic</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:49.610" style="s2">beauty of life together and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.770" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit of that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.610" end="00:14:53.210" style="s2">yeah not an action-adventure movie not</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:55.130" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.210" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">so another theme that really emerged</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.130" end="00:14:59.270" style="s2">talking to everybody was this theme of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:01.160" style="s2">death and rebirth so that as we go</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.270" end="00:15:03.140" style="s2">through a transition something it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.160" end="00:15:05.150" style="s2">necessarily has to die you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.140" end="00:15:07.310" style="s2">people are talking about that the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.150" end="00:15:08.540" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been in has to die for</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.310" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">something else to come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.540" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">my sense is after 65 harrowing years in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:18.590" style="s2">the planet that people rarely do their</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.070" style="s2">best sorry to say it out loud but there</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.590" end="00:15:22.310" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.070" end="00:15:24.980" style="s2">if this is our best you know what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.310" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">done to the thing entrusted to us God</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.980" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">Almighty</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:31.130" style="s2">either we&#39;re not doing our best or god</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">help us this is our best I&#39;m going with</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.130" end="00:15:36.980" style="s2">I think the more humanly benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.180" end="00:15:39.860" style="s2">vision that we&#39;re not doing our best</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.980" end="00:15:42.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing and so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.860" end="00:15:46.310" style="s2">fall back on the idea that left to our</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.200" end="00:15:49.010" style="s2">own devices will get it straight we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.310" end="00:15:52.340" style="s2">being left to our own devices and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.010" end="00:15:55.430" style="s2">not getting it straight you see so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.340" end="00:15:59.310" style="s2">going to have to be defeated</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.430" end="00:16:01.740" style="s2">my vision vision scuse me is the sooner</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.310" end="00:16:04.589" style="s2">we&#39;re defeated the better for all</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.740" end="00:16:08.420" style="s2">concerned do I know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.589" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">am I not aware that there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.420" end="00:16:14.310" style="s2">wreckage of various kinds that are that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">will ensue from what I&#39;m saying yeah man</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.310" end="00:16:19.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t have the blueprint right but if</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:21.779" style="s2">you&#39;re asking me as a citizen of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.320" end="00:16:24.930" style="s2">troubled time then my responsibility as</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.779" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">a citizen is to glimpse the end or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">extinction of this particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:33.960" style="s2">citizenship you know our regime has no</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:36.500" style="s2">business being in the world this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.960" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">demonstrable fact it&#39;s not an opinion</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.500" end="00:16:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a fact even though the likes of and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:45.029" style="s2">I really adore Jordan Peterson but when</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.630" end="00:16:48.020" style="s2">he continued in the old days it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.029" end="00:16:50.010" style="s2">so long ago now to favor the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.020" end="00:16:51.690" style="s2">developments of the West and so on I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.010" end="00:16:53.700" style="s2">think I understand why he would do so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.690" end="00:16:56.670" style="s2">but he has to ignore certain other</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.700" end="00:17:00.750" style="s2">things at his peril in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.670" end="00:17:02.910" style="s2">that case sadly so again I learned this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.750" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">thing at the death trade so you really</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.910" end="00:17:07.310" style="s2">love somebody who&#39;s dying yes do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:10.550" style="s2">think they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.310" end="00:17:12.590" style="s2">do they refuse to be dying or are they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.550" end="00:17:15.320" style="s2">dying because the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.590" end="00:17:17.510" style="s2">question determines what you do next so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.320" end="00:17:20.330" style="s2">let&#39;s say they&#39;re dying they don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.510" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">that they are but they are they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.330" end="00:17:24.290" style="s2">the early stages of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">what is the etiquette of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.290" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">relationship with them how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">conduct yourself as if what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">is happening that becomes the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">for a dying person in your household and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:40.280" style="s2">it becomes the same question for a time</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">like now where we get to glimpse how</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.280" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">utterly exhausted our acquisitive way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.420" end="00:17:48.710" style="s2">doing things</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:51.860" style="s2">has become so what do you do an answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.710" end="00:17:54.830" style="s2">to my mind is you bear faithful witness</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:57.680" style="s2">to the the realities of the dying and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.830" end="00:18:00.470" style="s2">you you orchestrate yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.680" end="00:18:03.740" style="s2">presence of the dying not to spite it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.470" end="00:18:05.860" style="s2">not to overcome it not to pretend it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.740" end="00:18:08.360" style="s2">not there for the sake of mutual comfort</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.860" end="00:18:10.190" style="s2">but to risk it all to risk the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.360" end="00:18:14.450" style="s2">relationship to friendship whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.190" end="00:18:17.960" style="s2">is and and failure and fail to conspire</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.450" end="00:18:20.929" style="s2">with the idea that there&#39;s more time</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.960" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">there isn&#39;t more time and that confers</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.929" end="00:18:27.260" style="s2">this upon this time a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:30.380" style="s2">urgency and if I really love you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.260" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be be with you as if you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.380" end="00:18:35.720" style="s2">be around much longer right and it how</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:38.299" style="s2">that makes you feel in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.720" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">well it&#39;s gonna be wild and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.299" end="00:18:42.200" style="s2">strange and we don&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:44.090" style="s2">we don&#39;t have an etiquette for endings</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.200" end="00:18:47.059" style="s2">in a culture that doesn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.090" end="00:18:49.190" style="s2">them so it&#39;s one of the reasons I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.059" end="00:18:51.669" style="s2">I ended up doing that book is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.190" end="00:18:54.850" style="s2">advocate for a sense of you could say</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.669" end="00:18:57.320" style="s2">fundamental etiquette our existential</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.850" end="00:19:00.470" style="s2">etiquette an etiquette of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.320" end="00:19:03.620" style="s2">radical love about what it means to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.470" end="00:19:05.899" style="s2">something down that&#39;s the phrase I came</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.620" end="00:19:07.700" style="s2">to use to describe it and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.899" end="00:19:12.159" style="s2">have to do now we have to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.700" end="00:19:15.190" style="s2">see our regime down of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.159" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">it means living with a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.190" end="00:19:20.360" style="s2">including a lot less certainty and no</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:23.720" style="s2">sense of safety I mean my country</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.360" end="00:19:25.909" style="s2">embarrasses me as they as they whine and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.720" end="00:19:28.070" style="s2">mule at the government for the you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.909" end="00:19:30.649" style="s2">the the sustaining handout instead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.070" end="00:19:33.470" style="s2">the death look man the situation was</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.649" end="00:19:36.010" style="s2">completely anticipated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.470" end="00:19:39.669" style="s2">unprecedented but it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.010" end="00:19:43.250" style="s2">anticipated okay now you&#39;ve had a taste</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.669" end="00:19:46.220" style="s2">how many more taste you want don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.250" end="00:19:49.190" style="s2">a meal of this push away from the table</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.220" end="00:19:51.140" style="s2">now and something else that usually</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.190" end="00:19:52.700" style="s2">comes out through through very old myths</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.140" end="00:19:55.100" style="s2">is that they teach us something about</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.700" end="00:19:57.740" style="s2">our role as human beings in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:19:59.870" style="s2">and Steven Jenkinson has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.740" end="00:20:01.580" style="s2">this a lot as well and I asked him about</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.870" end="00:20:02.690" style="s2">elders specifically because he&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.580" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">a book about that what&#39;s the role of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:07.340" style="s2">elders right now and he also then talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:09.159" style="s2">about what is the role of artists so to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.340" end="00:20:12.710" style="s2">my mind it goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.159" end="00:20:14.779" style="s2">you know elders are not people elders</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.710" end="00:20:19.620" style="s2">are not personality types not at age</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.779" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">group an elder is by definition of verb</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.620" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">that means it has a sequence a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:26.970" style="s2">cascading sequence of responsibilities</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.180" end="00:20:40.380" style="s2">to submit to life and so on like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.800" end="00:20:42.150" style="s2">yeah although that&#39;s true but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.380" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">of the day you could say the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.150" end="00:20:48.060" style="s2">fundamental Ellender function</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:50.370" style="s2">is the same function as the function of</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.370" end="00:20:57.880" style="s2">like this the artists responsibility is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.100" end="00:21:01.450" style="s2">to take their skillfulness develop it of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.880" end="00:21:04.180" style="s2">course learn like crazy and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:09.300" style="s2">the product of their work should</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.180" end="00:21:12.310" style="s2">function prismatic Li not complementary</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.300" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">complementarily but prismatic Li by</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.310" end="00:21:18.010" style="s2">which I mean that the culture which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.930" style="s2">invisible to itself the daily comings</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.010" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">and goings of the culture basically like</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.930" end="00:21:25.510" style="s2">the fish is water right we don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.190" end="00:21:26.830" style="s2">something goes sideways we see it for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.510" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">little while and then we go back to not</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:31.990" style="s2">seeing as quickly as we can but what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:34.780" style="s2">art does is it takes the essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.990" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">invisible culture the culture passes</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.780" end="00:21:39.640" style="s2">through the art and the constituent</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:43.270" style="s2">parts of the culture are refracted out</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.640" end="00:21:48.030" style="s2">the other side that&#39;s the encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.270" end="00:21:50.220" style="s2">the art the unbidden unsuspected</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.030" end="00:21:52.360" style="s2">consequence of arousal or</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.360" end="00:21:56.800" style="s2">is and so the the principal</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.000" end="00:21:59.620" style="s2">responsibility of the artist is to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:01.870" style="s2">out of the way of the art so the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.620" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">can pass through be refracted on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.870" end="00:22:08.170" style="s2">other side with this caveat that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:13.540" style="s2">artist has absolutely no obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.170" end="00:22:16.300" style="s2">restore to reassure to soothe the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.540" end="00:22:20.050" style="s2">culture as a consequence of what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.300" end="00:22:22.450" style="s2">artwork does okay they have to stand by</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.050" end="00:22:24.730" style="s2">the consequence of the work and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.450" end="00:22:26.350" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it very well indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.730" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">well you can think of examples of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.350" end="00:22:29.140" style="s2">who&#39;ve done that very thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:31.150" style="s2">unfortunately sometimes the culture will</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.140" end="00:22:33.340" style="s2">turn turn them into politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.150" end="00:22:35.710" style="s2">spokespeople for their generations and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.340" end="00:22:38.500" style="s2">they should resist all seduction to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.710" end="00:22:40.630" style="s2">such a thing because that means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.500" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">supposed to be complimentary of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.630" end="00:22:45.790" style="s2">particular generation they stand for and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:48.790" style="s2">so forth so elders function in a similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.790" end="00:22:51.100" style="s2">way I think elders responsibility is to</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.520" end="00:23:15.300" style="s2">should be that they are able to find</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">ever more faithful language that bears</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.620" end="00:23:28.309" style="s2">because they&#39;re no longer teaching</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:29.990" style="s2">becoming practitioners of what they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.030" end="00:23:40.700" style="s2">are discredited for very understandable</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:46.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a deep challenging thing indeed to</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.910" end="00:24:02.450" style="s2">what really attracted me to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.530" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work originally was this</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.450" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">sense of recapturing the mythopoetic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:10.550" style="s2">especially young because Young was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.410" style="s2">psychologist in the sort of early 20th</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.550" end="00:24:14.540" style="s2">century mid twentieth century who went</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.410" end="00:24:15.920" style="s2">more deeply into the unconscious than</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.540" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">just about anyone else and started</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.920" end="00:24:20.690" style="s2">pulling out the ideas of archetypes and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:22.520" style="s2">so and I think there&#39;s an amazing quote</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.690" end="00:24:24.920" style="s2">by Jordan Peterson where he said young</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.520" end="00:24:27.260" style="s2">brought together the world of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.920" end="00:24:29.929" style="s2">myth and story with science and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.260" end="00:24:31.309" style="s2">psychology and this was absolutely one</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.929" end="00:24:34.190" style="s2">of the most crucial pieces of work that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.309" end="00:24:35.780" style="s2">was actually done in the 20th century we</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.190" end="00:24:40.460" style="s2">embody a lot of information in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.780" end="00:24:42.200" style="s2">action interaction has developed as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.460" end="00:24:45.080" style="s2">consequence of imitating other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.200" end="00:24:46.340" style="s2">and not only the people the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.080" end="00:24:47.750" style="s2">around us but of course the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.340" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">around us imitated the people who came</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.750" end="00:24:52.520" style="s2">before them and those people in potato</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:54.679" style="s2">people who came before them and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.520" end="00:24:57.260" style="s2">far back that it&#39;s as far back as you</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.679" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">can go and so you embody these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.260" end="00:25:01.010" style="s2">of behavior that are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:02.870" style="s2">informative that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.010" end="00:25:04.610" style="s2">that are a consequence of collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.870" end="00:25:07.580" style="s2">imitation across the centuries and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.610" end="00:25:11.179" style="s2">then those patterns can become manifest</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.580" end="00:25:12.920" style="s2">as figures of the imagination and those</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.179" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">figures of imagination are the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.920" end="00:25:19.700" style="s2">distillation zuv patterns of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:21.860" style="s2">and so as the distillation zuv patterns</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.700" end="00:25:24.470" style="s2">of behavior they have content and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.860" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">not you that content it&#39;s you could even</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.470" end="00:25:28.040" style="s2">think about it as content that&#39;s evolved</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">although it&#39;s culturally transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.040" end="00:25:32.390" style="s2">this content that&#39;s evolved and so these</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:35.140" style="s2">figures of the imagination can reveal</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.390" end="00:25:37.250" style="s2">the structure of reality to you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.140" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened with Jung and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.250" end="00:25:40.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what he described in the red book</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.660" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">and that was what permeated his</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.780" end="00:25:46.010" style="s2">psychology a psychology that was Bey</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.060" end="00:26:16.190" style="s2">chaos itself and it&#39;s conceivable</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.660" end="00:26:19.490" style="s2">I think perhaps probable that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.190" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">more important conceptually happened in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.490" end="00:26:26.120" style="s2">the 20th century than that because it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:29.420" style="s2">was the first time post enlightenment</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:39.530" style="s2">have in the capacious intellect of Jung</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.030" end="00:26:42.860" style="s2">and the same thing happened to some</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.500" end="00:26:56.090" style="s2">I would say is it direct consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:59.030" style="s2">that Jordan Peterson has now looked at</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.090" end="00:27:00.350" style="s2">as a kind of why some people&#39;s are quite</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.390" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">like wow he&#39;s taking Jung seriously he</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.460" end="00:27:21.650" style="s2">was told by his colleagues at the</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.650" end="00:27:26.390" style="s2">not to go near Jung but that would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.870" end="00:27:27.350" style="s2">career suicide don&#39;t go near and he kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.390" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">of went into it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.350" end="00:27:31.340" style="s2">and that I think is a really that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:32.870" style="s2">I think made him such a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.340" end="00:27:35.240" style="s2">archetypal figure himself</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.870" end="00:27:37.820" style="s2">Jordan Peterson because he was bringing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.240" end="00:27:41.060" style="s2">this kind of archetypal force of the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.820" end="00:27:43.130" style="s2">story of the culture and where that gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.060" end="00:27:44.600" style="s2">integrated and where it&#39;s not integrated</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.130" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">is another question I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.600" end="00:27:48.350" style="s2">deeper question I&#39;d love to unpack in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:50.780" style="s2">the future thinking about potentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.350" end="00:27:53.330" style="s2">doing a film about the legacy of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.780" end="00:27:55.160" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s thought and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.330" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">amazing trajectory that we saw over</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.160" end="00:27:59.780" style="s2">though those kind of couple of years and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">but that for me is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.780" end="00:28:04.370" style="s2">yeah I think really important when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:05.809" style="s2">talking about myth and story as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.370" end="00:28:07.880" style="s2">make sense of the world and a way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.809" end="00:28:10.400" style="s2">make sense of our experience is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.880" end="00:28:12.409" style="s2">really draw on young and the just the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.400" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">very idea that we have an unconscious as</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.409" end="00:28:16.850" style="s2">individuals so that we are not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:18.409" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on with us in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">fact we&#39;re not aware of most of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.409" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">going on with us a lot of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">in that unconscious a part of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:27.409" style="s2">there are you know in Jung&#39;s theory and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:30.260" style="s2">this is really simplifying it but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.409" end="00:28:32.630" style="s2">say like encoded ways of being that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.260" end="00:28:35.179" style="s2">very very old and that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.630" end="00:28:38.059" style="s2">maybe drawn by experiences our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.179" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">had many many many times so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.059" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">wise old woman or the wise old man and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:45.140" style="s2">the trickster and all these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:47.330" style="s2">types of ways of being that we all can</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.140" end="00:28:49.370" style="s2">embody at some point and can have access</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.330" end="00:28:51.530" style="s2">to so there&#39;s that on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.370" end="00:28:52.760" style="s2">level but it also spreads out to what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.530" end="00:28:54.650" style="s2">you can call the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.760" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s where this becomes especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.650" end="00:28:58.820" style="s2">useful to look at you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:01.010" style="s2">coming out of the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.820" end="00:29:02.600" style="s2">when we go through a major major shift</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.010" end="00:29:06.380" style="s2">and a major crisis like we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.600" end="00:29:08.270" style="s2">right now and how do we how do we go in</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.380" end="00:29:11.140" style="s2">there and trying to make sense of it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.270" end="00:29:13.789" style="s2">a key thing to mention I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.140" end="00:29:16.549" style="s2">part of the reason young is so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.789" end="00:29:19.700" style="s2">to bring into academia is that young was</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.549" end="00:29:20.690" style="s2">really sanitized by by young&#39;uns after</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.700" end="00:29:22.010" style="s2">he died</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.690" end="00:29:23.960" style="s2">Peter Kings he&#39;s written a great book</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.010" end="00:29:26.030" style="s2">called catafalque all about this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.960" end="00:29:29.390" style="s2">about youngnam mystic and and how people</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.030" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">have misinterpreted him and this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.390" end="00:29:32.600" style="s2">understanding the world in this very</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:34.039" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s not the the way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.600" end="00:29:37.309" style="s2">knowing of science because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.039" end="00:29:40.010" style="s2">about symbolism and and nuance and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.309" end="00:29:41.960" style="s2">aesthetic and feeling and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.010" end="00:29:44.120" style="s2">so different to being able to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.960" end="00:29:47.299" style="s2">and measure something but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.120" end="00:29:49.429" style="s2">time we are able to at least map out in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.299" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">a sense what myths can tell us and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.429" end="00:29:53.090" style="s2">probably the person who did that best or</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:55.880" style="s2">one of the people who did it best was</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.090" end="00:29:58.669" style="s2">joseph campbell who has a theory called</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.880" end="00:30:00.679" style="s2">the monomyth which is the idea that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.669" end="00:30:02.539" style="s2">of our mythic structures that we tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.679" end="00:30:04.370" style="s2">all the stories we tell whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.539" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">in an inuit tried five hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:09.930" style="s2">or you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:12.030" style="s2">you know at London in 20 20 weeks held a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.930" end="00:30:13.680" style="s2">sim the same structures over and over</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.030" end="00:30:16.770" style="s2">because they are so deeply encoded in us</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.680" end="00:30:19.770" style="s2">and it&#39;s really the story of our process</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.770" end="00:30:21.540" style="s2">of discovery and change over time which</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.770" end="00:30:23.610" style="s2">is also called the hero&#39;s journey hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.540" end="00:30:26.160" style="s2">journey and in fact Charlotte you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.610" end="00:30:28.020" style="s2">who I spoke to you know she raised a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.160" end="00:30:29.820" style="s2">really interesting point about you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.020" end="00:30:31.710" style="s2">is you know the hero&#39;s journey has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.820" end="00:30:33.210" style="s2">recently criticized as being very male</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.710" end="00:30:35.370" style="s2">focused and I&#39;ve always been very</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.210" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">curious about this because I see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.370" end="00:30:38.520" style="s2">trajectory play out in stories about</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:41.580" style="s2">women as well so I kind of have issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.520" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">with that Charlotte you can mention this</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.580" end="00:30:46.260" style="s2">very interesting thing that male</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:48.150" style="s2">initiation and female initiation are</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.260" end="00:30:49.770" style="s2">actually play out differently but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.150" end="00:30:52.620" style="s2">actually still follow that trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.770" end="00:30:54.120" style="s2">we go from a place of somehow being</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.620" end="00:30:55.650" style="s2">deluded or somehow being safe in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.120" end="00:30:57.720" style="s2">little area or you know we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.650" end="00:31:00.750" style="s2">Shire or we&#39;re on Tatooine if you look</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.720" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">Skywalker and then we step out into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.750" end="00:31:04.890" style="s2">world into a different type of world</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">where we grow as a human being so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.890" end="00:31:08.370" style="s2">might be that it&#39;s a call to adventure</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">or as Charlotte says and a lot of female</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.370" end="00:31:12.180" style="s2">initiation stories you start at the top</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.310" style="s2">and then you&#39;re right down and she calls</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.180" end="00:31:16.350" style="s2">in the ashes all your everything is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.310" end="00:31:18.420" style="s2">stripped away which is the process we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.350" end="00:31:20.160" style="s2">going through this stripping away of all</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.420" end="00:31:21.990" style="s2">our pretenses are stripping away of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.160" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">nice dress you were wearing and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.990" end="00:31:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting in the muck with a fire</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:29.730" style="s2">but that process of coming back into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.400" end="00:31:32.390" style="s2">earth is really regenerative so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.730" end="00:31:34.680" style="s2">such a richness to this whole area and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.390" end="00:31:37.800" style="s2">Charlotte has a really interesting take</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.680" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">on one myth in particular which is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.800" end="00:31:41.970" style="s2">myth of psyche and I asked her a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.140" end="00:31:43.740" style="s2">bit about why that myth is so important</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:45.240" style="s2">right now and what I can tell us and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.740" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">the thing about the myth of psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.240" end="00:31:51.060" style="s2">that I think I said in I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:55.800" style="s2">this in the piece that you know her name</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.060" end="00:31:57.950" style="s2">means butterfly and there&#39;s this image</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.800" end="00:32:00.270" style="s2">of you know we are like a caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.950" end="00:32:02.660" style="s2">culture that&#39;s devouring everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.270" end="00:32:04.770" style="s2">every green thing has been devoured and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.660" end="00:32:07.140" style="s2">at some point we have to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.770" end="00:32:09.090" style="s2">cocoon and transform and in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.140" end="00:32:11.870" style="s2">the self isolation is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.090" end="00:32:13.730" style="s2">cocooning in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.870" end="00:32:15.650" style="s2">we go and become a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.730" end="00:32:17.750" style="s2">human being I mean whether we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.650" end="00:32:20.990" style="s2">respond like that is a different matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.750" end="00:32:24.830" style="s2">it remains to be seen but I feel it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.990" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">really it&#39;s a very good metaphor and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.830" end="00:32:28.550" style="s2">feeling of that one everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:30.520" style="s2">dissolving and question down is is part</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.550" end="00:32:35.210" style="s2">of what happens in a cocoon when a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.520" end="00:32:39.110" style="s2">caterpillar becomes an amalgam yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.210" end="00:32:43.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a nice image you mentioned just now</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.110" end="00:32:45.620" style="s2">about that&#39;s all having us all going</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.280" end="00:32:47.590" style="s2">through our own transformation in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.620" end="00:32:49.910" style="s2">unique way we&#39;re all different in</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.590" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">outbreak in the piece we&#39;re just talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.910" end="00:32:54.410" style="s2">about a thing you mentioned somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">that the female and the male initiatory</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.410" end="00:32:58.760" style="s2">journey and myth is actually different</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:01.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s an idea I&#39;m really curious</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.760" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">about to want to hear a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.370" end="00:33:05.030" style="s2">about that and in what ways and of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:06.890" style="s2">course we probably know much more about</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.030" end="00:33:09.230" style="s2">the male one because of the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.890" end="00:33:12.260" style="s2">journey and just candle etc Chisholm</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.230" end="00:33:14.990" style="s2">where I know a lot of my myth knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.260" end="00:33:17.270" style="s2">from and so I&#39;m really very curious</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.990" end="00:33:19.010" style="s2">about is these different types of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:24.610" style="s2">initiation and how they might apply to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.010" end="00:33:27.650" style="s2">it right now well I think I think I mean</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.700" end="00:34:52.760" style="s2">about it&#39;s interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:55.340" style="s2">mentioned the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.760" end="00:34:57.560" style="s2">because I think we&#39;ve all had this sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.340" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">of feeling that sort of sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.560" end="00:35:01.670" style="s2">collective consciousness much more than</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:04.070" style="s2">ever before this sort of sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.670" end="00:35:05.660" style="s2">everyone is focused on the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.070" end="00:35:06.920" style="s2">knowing that everyone is aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.660" end="00:35:09.890" style="s2">same thing everyone is focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.920" end="00:35:12.710" style="s2">same thing and that&#39;s sort of this sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.890" end="00:35:15.230" style="s2">of initiation as well that the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.710" end="00:35:17.180" style="s2">journey the monomyth is all about</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.230" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">initiation it&#39;s all about going from one</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.180" end="00:35:21.320" style="s2">state to another and why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.760" style="s2">relevant is that it Maps on to its the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.320" end="00:35:24.650" style="s2">process that we all individually go</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.760" end="00:35:27.620" style="s2">through and then it&#39;s represented in me</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.650" end="00:35:29.360" style="s2">it&#39;s represented in story and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.620" end="00:35:31.550" style="s2">a really interesting frame to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.360" end="00:35:33.980" style="s2">it as well this sort of sense of could</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.550" end="00:35:38.090" style="s2">this crisis be a collective initiation</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">in some way I think it has to be I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:41.090" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like this is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">I think a lot of people have had it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.090" end="00:35:45.470" style="s2">like we can&#39;t waste this crisis and if</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:48.290" style="s2">we do waste this crisis then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.470" end="00:35:50.060" style="s2">just store up for another crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.290" end="00:35:52.670" style="s2">almost like to be bigger than this one</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.060" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">so another aspect of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.670" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">liminal or the space between worlds as</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">that calls it is that it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:36:01.790" style="s2">trial it&#39;s an initiation and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">Charlotte you can actually said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.790" end="00:36:05.120" style="s2">really easy in myth to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:06.860" style="s2">underworld it&#39;s really difficult to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.120" end="00:36:09.050" style="s2">out of the underworld and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.860" end="00:36:11.990" style="s2">really distinguishes a character and a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.050" end="00:36:14.030" style="s2">story and so Zac spoke spoke really well</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.990" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">about what it actually takes and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.030" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">what this process is of being in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:22.700" style="s2">liminal space life life itself of knowin</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.060" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">out of your own doing will often create</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.700" end="00:36:26.240" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">demand a profound change in your</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:33.170" style="s2">identity right and again the loss of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:35.390" style="s2">loved one spouse or a brother or sister</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.170" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">or something that will make you have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.390" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">change and so there&#39;s a dynamic to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">psyche where this is part of living that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve become new people and so my</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.180" end="00:36:47.870" style="s2">background was in developmental</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.560" end="00:36:51.140" style="s2">psychology and philosophy of education</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.870" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2">and the whole thing there Allah you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.140" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">Keegan and then others in Dawson and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.050" end="00:36:59.570" style="s2">Kirk Fischer is that actually we can we</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">can look at this actually works there</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.570" end="00:37:07.700" style="s2">are ways that we are we are by just</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:10.190" style="s2">growing up over time become new people</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.700" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">so that the mind can do this but for</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.190" end="00:37:15.620" style="s2">many adults beyond the age of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:20.690" style="s2">30 or so for various reasons it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.620" end="00:37:25.550" style="s2">harder and harder to to to die to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.690" end="00:37:27.740" style="s2">yourself basically and to to create a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.550" end="00:37:31.190" style="s2">more responsive and adaptive way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.740" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">being it becomes harder to do that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.190" end="00:37:35.870" style="s2">can go into that but that&#39;s not kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:38.090" style="s2">the point here so in this moment the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.870" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">whole world is basically put into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.090" end="00:37:42.020" style="s2">situation where again every unique</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:44.780" style="s2">person contemplating their own unique</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.020" end="00:37:48.470" style="s2">situation and unique death brings us to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.780" end="00:37:50.530" style="s2">a situation where kind of mass metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.470" end="00:37:54.940" style="s2">right which is this a mass</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.530" end="00:37:57.470" style="s2">transformation of psyche will occur and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.940" end="00:38:01.120" style="s2">then there&#39;s a question of will it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.470" end="00:38:04.070" style="s2">happen to us or will we try to gain</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.120" end="00:38:05.570" style="s2">sovereignty and agency over the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.070" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">transformation of self that&#39;s being</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:11.380" style="s2">thing you can do as a support person for</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.500" end="00:38:15.230" style="s2">someone in a process of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.380" end="00:38:19.730" style="s2">right is to give them the scaffoldings</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.230" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">they need to be able to to choose to not</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.730" end="00:38:26.180" style="s2">be subject to circumstance but to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:29.270" style="s2">able to feel like they can be true to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.180" end="00:38:32.570" style="s2">their most important principles right</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.270" end="00:38:34.040" style="s2">not like not protect them from pain but</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.570" end="00:38:36.220" style="s2">actually put them in a position to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.040" end="00:38:38.530" style="s2">able to know who they want to become</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.220" end="00:38:41.619" style="s2">and to act from those principles which</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.530" end="00:38:45.640" style="s2">means that no matter how bad it gets</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.619" end="00:38:47.740" style="s2">you can keep your integrity and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.640" end="00:38:51.070" style="s2">about moving the sense of self from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.740" end="00:38:54.580" style="s2">kind of extrinsic motivation and</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.430" end="00:40:25.190" style="s2">the circumstances we lament so</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:27.830" style="s2">desperately right and those selves you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.190" end="00:40:29.540" style="s2">were just referring to their principal</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.830" end="00:40:32.060" style="s2">players and keeping this whole operation</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.540" end="00:40:35.120" style="s2">going and if you have any doubt of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.060" end="00:40:37.610" style="s2">look at the consequence of us keeping</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.120" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">those selves of ours to ourselves at</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.610" end="00:40:45.710" style="s2">home the direct palpable consequence</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:48.680" style="s2">just economically right so the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.710" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">could use less of ourselves it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.680" end="00:40:54.890" style="s2">me and right now it may be enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:57.080" style="s2">itself okay so as I said that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.890" end="00:41:00.290" style="s2">ungenerous and I don&#39;t mean this in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.080" end="00:41:03.050" style="s2">caustic or condemning fashion but it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.290" end="00:41:07.070" style="s2">an invitation to consider this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.050" end="00:41:10.220" style="s2">getting back or returning or reorienting</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.070" end="00:41:13.340" style="s2">a reacquainting or all of that language</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.220" end="00:41:15.410" style="s2">that habits are at the front of it is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.340" end="00:41:18.110" style="s2">be suspected it&#39;s to be wondered about</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.410" end="00:41:20.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know if you have this</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.110" end="00:41:22.190" style="s2">where you are but certainly for the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.120" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">30 or 40 years people are using language</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.190" end="00:41:27.860" style="s2">like rewilding which is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:30.200" style="s2">hilarious or getting back to the land</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.860" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">and anybody who had ever used that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.200" end="00:41:35.300" style="s2">phrase was never on the land to begin</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">with you see so there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.300" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">reacquainting to do it&#39;s learning it</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:49.070" style="s2">getting familiar again</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:51.980" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s my my plea is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.070" end="00:41:54.920" style="s2">not pick up where we left off to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.980" end="00:41:59.230" style="s2">that the thing that was interrupted had</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.920" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">no business continuing and this this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.230" end="00:42:04.910" style="s2">virus this is a god</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.470" end="00:42:08.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not overstating things this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.910" end="00:42:11.090" style="s2">God and the gods in the house and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.870" end="00:42:15.560" style="s2">gods have in God&#39;s way as God tends to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.090" end="00:42:18.350" style="s2">do and our obligation is to be exercised</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.560" end="00:42:21.590" style="s2">a kind of radical hospitality to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.350" end="00:42:24.710" style="s2">anarchic presence</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.590" end="00:42:27.530" style="s2">and to learn how to be undone by this</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.710" end="00:42:30.710" style="s2">presence a really common theme was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.530" end="00:42:32.930" style="s2">we are all of us right now together in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.710" end="00:42:35.720" style="s2">the wilderness somewhere you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.930" end="00:42:39.380" style="s2">metaphorically we&#39;re out past the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.720" end="00:42:41.510" style="s2">of no return in many ways and Zach Stein</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.380" end="00:42:43.550" style="s2">said it really beautifully actually when</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.510" end="00:42:46.310" style="s2">we&#39;re in the wilderness we have to carry</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.550" end="00:42:48.590" style="s2">our temple with us so we have to I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.310" end="00:42:50.300" style="s2">what he means by that is that the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.590" end="00:42:52.100" style="s2">that matter most to us and the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.300" end="00:42:54.680" style="s2">that will help us through and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.100" end="00:42:57.020" style="s2">help us overcome are things that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.680" end="00:42:58.490" style="s2">to hold very dear and we have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.020" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">hold of them as we&#39;re in this really</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.490" end="00:43:04.250" style="s2">liminal space and very practically for</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:06.910" style="s2">me I think that translates to some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.250" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">those qualities that we can develop by</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.910" end="00:43:10.520" style="s2">connecting with each other deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">authentically by increasing our</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.520" end="00:43:16.940" style="s2">resilience by following the truth of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:19.340" style="s2">experience and all of those core</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.940" end="00:43:20.450" style="s2">qualities that so many wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.340" end="00:43:22.700" style="s2">and so many people have talked about for</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.450" end="00:43:25.010" style="s2">years as being really key to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.700" end="00:43:27.500" style="s2">now it feels like more than ever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.010" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">all coming to a fore and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.500" end="00:43:32.020" style="s2">we might have been cultivating up until</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:35.210" style="s2">now suddenly now is the time to use them</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.020" end="00:43:37.730" style="s2">the adolescents who form their mature</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.210" end="00:43:41.630" style="s2">adult identity under these conditions</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.730" end="00:43:45.350" style="s2">are the ones who will lead the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.630" end="00:43:47.840" style="s2">and so we need to be concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.350" end="00:43:50.120" style="s2">ourselves of course as adults we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.840" end="00:43:51.380" style="s2">take care of ourselves as adults but we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.120" end="00:43:55.730" style="s2">need to take care of ourselves as adults</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.380" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">on behalf of this generation who is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.730" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">coming of age during this so that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">that&#39;s where the place of like the new</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:05.720" style="s2">person emerging that&#39;s where that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:11.480" style="s2">becomes like most vibrant isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.720" end="00:44:12.770" style="s2">that age group and so yes so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.480" end="00:44:14.150" style="s2">little bit on that there&#39;s of course a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.770" end="00:44:15.860" style="s2">lot to say on that but I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.150" end="00:44:17.660" style="s2">say we all need to become this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.860" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">person you can transcend fear or we all</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.660" end="00:44:21.320" style="s2">need to become this kind of person who</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">can like be there for others it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.320" end="00:44:27.940" style="s2">it&#39;s much more nuanced right now some</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:30.710" style="s2">people need to go inside of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.940" end="00:44:31.859" style="s2">and deal with their own before they</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.710" end="00:44:34.470" style="s2">could ever go and out</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.859" end="00:44:35.759" style="s2">people right um some right now some</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.470" end="00:44:37.470" style="s2">people need to stop helping other people</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.759" end="00:44:38.819" style="s2">so much so that they don&#39;t break down</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.470" end="00:44:41.369" style="s2">and then become a burden on everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.819" end="00:44:43.619" style="s2">else right so there&#39;s a lot of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.369" end="00:44:45.539" style="s2">that are implying the key thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.619" end="00:44:48.390" style="s2">pointing to is and it&#39;s one I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.539" end="00:44:51.809" style="s2">the first question in my essay you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.390" end="00:44:54.269" style="s2">can we clarify the things that were most</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.809" end="00:44:57.480" style="s2">committed to like the core of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.269" end="00:44:59.549" style="s2">integrity as a person and if we know</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.480" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">that can we then understand what it</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.549" end="00:45:04.710" style="s2">would mean to be that person under all</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:08.789" style="s2">circumstances right and then we&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.710" end="00:45:10.499" style="s2">a kind of compass and when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.789" end="00:45:11.999" style="s2">what are those core commitments and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.499" end="00:45:15.900" style="s2">are the language that we use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.999" end="00:45:17.609" style="s2">the things we would die for yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.900" end="00:45:18.989" style="s2">where we need to have discussions like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.609" end="00:45:22.279" style="s2">these that&#39;s where the dialogue goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.989" end="00:45:25.230" style="s2">comes in where we talk about the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.279" end="00:45:27.509" style="s2">parts of our lives that touch everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.230" end="00:45:28.769" style="s2">right the issues of ultimate concern and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.509" end="00:45:31.470" style="s2">these are the conversations you fall</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.769" end="00:45:33.930" style="s2">into with people in hospice work right</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.470" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">or in caregiving work or even in just</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.930" end="00:45:40.460" style="s2">the state of fear of the ambient kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">like skull grinning in on the banquette</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.460" end="00:45:48.930" style="s2">right so yeah new people are coming and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:52.099" style="s2">it&#39;s this question of who who we will</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.930" end="00:45:54.779" style="s2">who will choose to become essentially</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.779" end="00:45:59.099" style="s2">the world at a deeper level than the</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.099" end="00:46:04.890" style="s2">times of crisis and change which is why</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.210" end="00:46:07.950" style="s2">we want to do what we can to meet the</p>
