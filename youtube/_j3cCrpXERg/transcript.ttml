<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:36.940" style="s2">well how how do those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.580" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.940" end="00:01:39.759" style="s2">well there&#39;s and I&#39;m not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:41.649" style="s2">through this in detail we can if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">like but there&#39;s certain characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.649" end="00:01:44.649" style="s2">that we can actually begin to take a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:49.390" style="s2">look at they give us a sense of when</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.649" end="00:01:51.670" style="s2">where things are and well where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.390" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">is actually rather challenging now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.670" end="00:01:57.100" style="s2">in a situation which is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.960" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">awesome and probably it&#39;s quite bad okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.100" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">well how bad how big an order of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:04.660" style="s2">magnitude trouble are we looking at well</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">let&#39;s just take a couple of examples to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.660" end="00:02:12.129" style="s2">kind of gauge the order of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">let&#39;s just start with one everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.129" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">involved the whole world every single</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:17.050" style="s2">human on the planet is involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">door that has never happened before</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.050" end="00:02:20.920" style="s2">before right now any time any trouble</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">has emerged it&#39;s been a tiny tiny</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.920" end="00:02:24.819" style="s2">fraction of the human family the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:26.739" style="s2">collapse of all time the bronze age</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.819" end="00:02:30.099" style="s2">collapse happened right there and hit</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.739" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">you know 15 percent most of the cities</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.099" end="00:02:34.420" style="s2">but 15 percent of the people now</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:36.370" style="s2">everybody&#39;s involved so if anything goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.420" end="00:02:39.610" style="s2">sideways that is vaguely the order of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.370" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">magnitude of something of that kind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.610" end="00:02:43.900" style="s2">going to be a lot bigger like a lot lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:45.160" style="s2">bigger because these things reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.900" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">each other you mean notice that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.160" end="00:02:51.099" style="s2">things go south people become less good</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">at dealing with each other gently which</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:58.120" style="s2">makes it worse let&#39;s try another one</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:59.379" style="s2">we have nukes lots of us have nukes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.120" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">we&#39;re getting better at making new so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.379" end="00:03:02.200" style="s2">more of us are going to have news and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.599" style="s2">don&#39;t just have nukes we also have</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:06.280" style="s2">CRISPR which means that people can start</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.599" end="00:03:08.830" style="s2">making genetic weapons that are nucleic</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.280" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">in capacity and ink over time not too</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.830" end="00:03:11.860" style="s2">long from now we&#39;re also going to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:14.270" style="s2">micro drones that can target assassinate</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.860" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">pretty much anybody on Khan</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.270" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2">fill-in-the-blank wish to say that up</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">until now no matter how hard we tried we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really kill that many of us we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">tried really hard we had guns and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">bullets and gas and still didn&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">that many of us to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">human population even the Black Plague</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">is like a little divot now we can&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">fact kill everybody or at least mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:42.240" style="s2">everybody okay next technological change</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the charts</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.240" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">to show the pace of technological change</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:51.240" style="s2">but if you look at a graph that goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:52.770" style="s2">like this and you&#39;re here things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.240" end="00:03:55.800" style="s2">different than they were when you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.770" end="00:03:57.270" style="s2">here and the 1940s was like here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.800" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">terms of the pace of change that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.270" end="00:04:02.520" style="s2">going on you know the in the the degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.030" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">to which our actuation convention is our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.520" end="00:04:06.510" style="s2">capacity to do things in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">accelerating is really not</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.510" end="00:04:11.490" style="s2">comprehensible to anyone I wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">essay called the generation Omega where</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.490" end="00:04:15.230" style="s2">I talked about if the amount of change</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">is continuing to move to current pace</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">then the capacity of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.060" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">in the current generation I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:25.890" style="s2">like 30 years from now will be 1 million</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.050" style="s2">times more than now and I kind of get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.890" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">sense of that that&#39;s like going from</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.050" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">inventing language to the computer in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:34.979" style="s2">single generation right and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:39.020" style="s2">already have computers so what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.979" end="00:04:40.950" style="s2">looked like that&#39;s big Shh</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.020" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">let me think there&#39;s like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.950" end="00:04:45.510" style="s2">more oh sorry climate we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:47.760" style="s2">whole world every single one of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.510" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">activities has a characteristic that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.760" end="00:04:51.590" style="s2">generates an externality it is not well</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">processed by the complex environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.590" end="00:04:55.229" style="s2">when we&#39;re relatively lightweight</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">there&#39;s not many of us and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.229" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">engaging a lot of those activities the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">complex environment can still process it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:04.500" style="s2">sometimes heavy metals not so much well</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of us and we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.500" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">increasingly intensive activities so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.930" end="00:05:10.950" style="s2">not really talking about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:13.350" style="s2">which has kind of been scary but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">like this big on the scale I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.350" end="00:05:16.620" style="s2">about comprehensive destruction of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:19.320" style="s2">entire complex web of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.620" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">across every single bind I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.320" end="00:05:24.330" style="s2">about concentration of heavy metals</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:25.979" style="s2">hormones I&#39;m talking about the complete</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.330" end="00:05:27.010" style="s2">depletion of oxygen in oceans I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.979" end="00:05:28.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.010" end="00:05:30.520" style="s2">shitshow and it&#39;s n-dimensional it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.990" end="00:05:32.710" style="s2">over the place and each one reinforces</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:34.510" style="s2">the others so it&#39;s at some point only is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.710" end="00:05:35.920" style="s2">a little tipping point here then you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.510" end="00:05:38.470" style="s2">cascade effects that run all over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">place I can go on by the way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.470" end="00:05:43.390" style="s2">about 500 of these each one of which</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:45.070" style="s2">tells the same story it&#39;s big the order</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.390" end="00:05:46.330" style="s2">of magnitude is at least a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.070" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">years and probably on the order of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.330" end="00:05:50.020" style="s2">million years we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:53.290" style="s2">origin of humanity big and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.020" end="00:05:54.730" style="s2">bigger than that so now the question is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.290" end="00:05:56.590" style="s2">how in God&#39;s name do we deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.730" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">well we probably having a slightest idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.590" end="00:06:03.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re as human beings we&#39;re we live</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.290" style="s2">a hundred years and most of that is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.640" end="00:06:07.270" style="s2">in a thirty year window</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.290" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">we&#39;re actually identically acting out in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.270" end="00:06:12.370" style="s2">the world so we&#39;re not really wired to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:15.430" style="s2">deal with things that are magnitudes</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.370" end="00:06:16.900" style="s2">larger than that we aren&#39;t well designed</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.430" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">to perceive things that are much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.900" end="00:06:23.470" style="s2">than us from are smaller than us in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:25.630" style="s2">scale space or time so then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.470" end="00:06:27.670" style="s2">ask ourselves what might be what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.630" end="00:06:29.830" style="s2">thing might be we&#39;d be part of or be in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.670" end="00:06:31.420" style="s2">relationship with that is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.830" end="00:06:33.640" style="s2">thing that ordeals and orders of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.420" end="00:06:36.100" style="s2">magnitude that are even vaguely in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.640" end="00:06:37.510" style="s2">size that we&#39;re dealing with and so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.100" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">proposition is that perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.510" end="00:06:41.410" style="s2">something like culture maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:42.730" style="s2">something deeper than culture like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.410" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">generator functionally gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.730" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2">culture itself like innovation in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:51.430" style="s2">evolution it&#39;s something in that order</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.220" end="00:06:55.740" style="s2">so when I say culture what I mean is we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.430" end="00:06:59.710" style="s2">create artifacts institutions stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.740" end="00:07:01.630" style="s2">technologies that actuate our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.710" end="00:07:06.010" style="s2">increase our capacity to think and to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.630" end="00:07:08.620" style="s2">in the world and that change us and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.010" end="00:07:10.840" style="s2">we create them they create us and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.620" end="00:07:12.010" style="s2">together we Co evolve but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.840" end="00:07:13.270" style="s2">artifacts that are produced by us</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.010" end="00:07:15.190" style="s2">through our intelligence through our</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.270" end="00:07:18.010" style="s2">hands and our capacity to do things in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.190" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">the world of this one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.010" end="00:07:24.040" style="s2">we do is we we tell stories and when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:25.660" style="s2">tell stories we will often find that our</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.040" end="00:07:28.750" style="s2">stories are built around these</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.660" end="00:07:30.460" style="s2">mythopoetic archetypes now there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:33.160" style="s2">possible ways of grasping this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.460" end="00:07:34.360" style="s2">mythopoetic archetype well three one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.160" end="00:07:36.550" style="s2">to say that it&#39;s nonsense but I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.360" end="00:07:37.660" style="s2">to ignore that one the second is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.550" end="00:07:39.580" style="s2">most common is to say well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.660" end="00:07:42.100" style="s2">artifact of culture that cultures</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.580" end="00:07:43.750" style="s2">telling stories for a long time and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.100" end="00:07:45.430" style="s2">the degree to which certain stories have</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.750" end="00:07:46.930" style="s2">been showing up over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.430" end="00:07:50.470" style="s2">which means that there in cultures had</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.930" end="00:07:52.540" style="s2">been around or they keep showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.470" end="00:07:55.420" style="s2">culture it&#39;s one of the two they have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.540" end="00:07:57.130" style="s2">density to them they have a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.420" end="00:07:58.030" style="s2">nough stew them and so they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.130" end="00:08:00.700" style="s2">thing that you might want to consider</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.030" end="00:08:01.900" style="s2">counting on when things get squishy so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.700" end="00:08:02.740" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of taking a look at it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.900" end="00:08:04.150" style="s2">if we&#39;re doing that something that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.740" end="00:08:06.370" style="s2">the order of magnitude say a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">years that by itself is enough if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.370" end="00:08:10.570" style="s2">going to be trying to search for what</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:12.850" style="s2">are the kinds of things that pass on</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.570" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">through thousand year cycles we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.850" end="00:08:17.500" style="s2">have to be looking for the deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.810" end="00:08:19.570" style="s2">mythopoetic locations in our stories and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.500" end="00:08:21.940" style="s2">by the way in our bodies so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.570" end="00:08:25.990" style="s2">about our bodies because the same threat</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.940" end="00:08:28.600" style="s2">works at a longer scale our bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.990" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">narratives in a sense meaning that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.600" end="00:08:33.940" style="s2">kinds of things that have been showing</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:35.320" style="s2">up for now thousands of generations the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.940" end="00:08:37.900" style="s2">things have been showing that made us</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.320" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">Homo sapiens sapiens instincts that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.900" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">wired into us at a very deep level at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:46.360" style="s2">precognitive level are still mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:47.770" style="s2">in the deeper sense meaning that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.360" end="00:08:50.650" style="s2">are the kinds of things that showed up</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.770" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">because they continue to show up protect</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.650" end="00:08:55.480" style="s2">your young is a mythopoetic this is in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:58.510" style="s2">the body it is physical because</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">obviously any being that has young that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.510" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">are not fish and being it has a small</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:03.550" style="s2">number of young that are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">vulnerable and doesn&#39;t embody protect</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.550" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">your young is quickly extinguished now</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:09.400" style="s2">of course we can be conscious of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:11.650" style="s2">and have it as a virtue but our body</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.400" end="00:09:14.380" style="s2">naturally expresses it and so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.650" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">process is even deeper it&#39;s because okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.380" end="00:09:17.950" style="s2">well what is that what&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.780" style="s2">is there a story in that are there deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.950" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">threads that are actually showing up</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.780" end="00:09:24.490" style="s2">that brings us to where we are now now I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:27.730" style="s2">can say well the mythopoetic stories are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:29.830" style="s2">both they&#39;re both narratives that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.730" end="00:09:33.700" style="s2">happened to keep showing up and they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.830" end="00:09:36.550" style="s2">also wisdom that has been endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.700" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">find the deepest threads that have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.550" end="00:09:43.510" style="s2">showing up in our bodies that are as</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.860" style="s2">deep as we can go and to reify them into</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.510" end="00:09:46.780" style="s2">things that can be made available to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.860" end="00:09:49.780" style="s2">consciousness so they can we find them</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.780" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">and do them well that is the ground upon</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.780" end="00:09:53.099" style="s2">which you can build something they might</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:55.599" style="s2">endure</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.099" end="00:09:59.199" style="s2">could you talk a bit about your personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.599" end="00:10:01.149" style="s2">background your personal history and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.199" end="00:10:02.919" style="s2">it relates to the models that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.149" end="00:10:06.309" style="s2">constructed to understand the world over</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.919" end="00:10:08.109" style="s2">the last 20 years or so if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.309" end="00:10:11.409" style="s2">notice that what we&#39;re engaging is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.109" end="00:10:13.389" style="s2">very interesting inquiry because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.409" end="00:10:17.679" style="s2">in tempting to do sense making about</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.389" end="00:10:19.899" style="s2">sense making and for me with that ends</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.679" end="00:10:22.329" style="s2">if I was doing is creating many</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.899" end="00:10:24.789" style="s2">different layers of awareness of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.329" end="00:10:28.329" style="s2">happening so even trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.789" end="00:10:31.479" style="s2">how to tell the story of how my personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.329" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">history leads to the inquiry into sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.479" end="00:10:39.099" style="s2">makings of course making sense of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:48.279" style="s2">story but broadly speaking it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.099" end="00:10:50.379" style="s2">as I was born in 1971 in Texas and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.279" end="00:10:54.689" style="s2">father was in the military but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.379" end="00:10:57.039" style="s2">move around too much and my mom was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.689" end="00:10:59.349" style="s2">college-educated went on to a career in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.039" end="00:11:04.119" style="s2">psychology and education and ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.349" end="00:11:06.249" style="s2">politics and for me there&#39;s if you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.119" end="00:11:09.339" style="s2">anything about the culture of Texas in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.249" end="00:11:12.699" style="s2">the 70s just assume that&#39;s if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.339" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">watched the movie boyhood or dazed and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.699" end="00:11:18.970" style="s2">confused just assume that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.220" end="00:11:24.489" style="s2">context and then later on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.970" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">I was participating in boy nerd culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.489" end="00:11:32.889" style="s2">in that time so comic books science</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:35.879" style="s2">fiction fantasy a really OCD level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.889" end="00:11:38.109" style="s2">pop culture of film and television</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.879" end="00:11:42.809" style="s2">computers and role-playing games and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.109" end="00:11:45.849" style="s2">again pretty obsessively like a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.809" end="00:11:47.619" style="s2">so this is impresses itself upon my</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.849" end="00:11:52.329" style="s2">psychology lots of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.619" end="00:11:53.889" style="s2">artifacts things like not just the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.329" end="00:11:55.629" style="s2">notion of say the way that a person who</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.889" end="00:11:57.669" style="s2">grew up playing chess thinks about life</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.629" end="00:12:00.220" style="s2">in the model or the framework of chess</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.669" end="00:12:02.319" style="s2">but actually growing up playing every</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.960" end="00:12:09.070" style="s2">you can drop into any game and be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.339" end="00:12:12.520" style="s2">to derive what it is if we sort of fast</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.070" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">forward to college this put me in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.520" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">place where for example I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">have any particular notion of a major</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.370" style="s2">because that&#39;s just a story and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.370" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">trying to accomplish so I just hacked</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.910" end="00:12:29.260" style="s2">hacking had become somewhat meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.880" end="00:12:32.500" style="s2">in that timeframe and I had participated</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.260" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">in hacker culture so broad like broadly</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.500" end="00:12:35.890" style="s2">applying the hacker ethos - whatever</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.570" end="00:13:37.330" style="s2">to the financial crisis of 2008 but as</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.740" end="00:13:39.550" style="s2">nice like I actually got on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.330" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">to apply the underlying theory refining</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.550" end="00:13:42.850" style="s2">the theory and practice like really</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:45.370" style="s2">seeing firsthand how a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.850" end="00:13:47.260" style="s2">things emerged and went through their</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.370" end="00:13:49.779" style="s2">arc it&#39;s like from inception all the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.260" end="00:13:51.640" style="s2">to maturity through that through the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.779" end="00:13:52.870" style="s2">pace and ended up with enough resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.640" end="00:13:58.450" style="s2">that I could more or less do what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.870" end="00:14:01.959" style="s2">wanted to so so then I did and I spent</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.450" end="00:14:05.560" style="s2">two glorious years doing exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.959" end="00:14:07.660" style="s2">wanted to and in the process of that but</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.560" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">largely what I want to do is like spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.660" end="00:14:10.839" style="s2">time at a place called the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:13.240" style="s2">Institute and by the way another place</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.839" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">called Necker Islands like two very</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.240" end="00:14:17.620" style="s2">different versions of what I want to but</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.060" end="00:14:18.310" style="s2">continued by the way basic under the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.620" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">heading of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.310" end="00:14:21.070" style="s2">a better sense of what&#39;s exactly going</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">on like our who are these rich people</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.070" end="00:14:24.910" style="s2">we&#39;ve heard of and who at the global</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.230" end="00:14:26.920" style="s2">elite did we first so much about oh I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:30.940" style="s2">would just meet them and find out so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.920" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">did and in the context of science art</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.940" end="00:14:34.510" style="s2">we&#39;re the smartest people do the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:35.980" style="s2">interesting work in the broadest way oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.510" end="00:14:37.750" style="s2">they&#39;re here okay cool let&#39;s go spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.980" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">time with them as well but then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.750" end="00:14:42.190" style="s2">financial crisis hit and I happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.680" style="s2">just sitting there at a place where I</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.190" end="00:14:46.210" style="s2">could ask questions and so I start</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.680" end="00:14:48.550" style="s2">asking questions and I was in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.210" end="00:14:50.830" style="s2">really interesting place where I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">literally at a conference at SFI when I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.830" end="00:14:55.180" style="s2">think like the Dow dropped 800 points</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">900 points and a thousand points like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.180" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">day after day after day which had the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">consequence of getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:07.810" style="s2">attention and I was able to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:10.360" style="s2">story that was being told through MSNBC</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.810" end="00:15:12.339" style="s2">and through official channels I was able</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:13.660" style="s2">to ask the actual Nobel prize-winning</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.339" end="00:15:16.330" style="s2">economists who just happened to be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.660" end="00:15:18.370" style="s2">right there what&#39;s actually going on and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.330" end="00:15:20.740" style="s2">as they believed then witnessed the gap</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.370" end="00:15:23.770" style="s2">between the official story what was</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.740" end="00:15:26.080" style="s2">really happening and the fact the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.770" end="00:15:27.820" style="s2">economists had no idea there</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.080" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2">even their underlying models were just</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.820" end="00:15:34.630" style="s2">whack so I got interested and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:36.970" style="s2">started digging and I just more or less</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.630" end="00:15:39.880" style="s2">followed my nose you know I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.970" end="00:15:43.900" style="s2">read all the books on money theory for</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.880" end="00:15:46.180" style="s2">example and David Graeber book by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.900" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">way is fantastic and blows a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.180" end="00:15:51.460" style="s2">concepts particularly the legitimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:53.830" style="s2">the economic discipline out of the water</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.460" end="00:15:55.930" style="s2">and of course also about other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.830" end="00:15:57.070" style="s2">like complexity economics but didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.930" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">know that did you know it didn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.070" end="00:15:59.800" style="s2">there what you start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:00.760" style="s2">complexity the first thing you learn is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.800" end="00:16:03.400" style="s2">that everything&#39;s connected everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:04.390" style="s2">else so if you want to do economics you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.400" end="00:16:06.040" style="s2">also have to look at the interface</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.390" end="00:16:07.480" style="s2">between economics and politics I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.040" end="00:16:09.520" style="s2">yesterday we talked about the four layer</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.480" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">model that talks about the path you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.520" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">you can for example model finance</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:17.650" style="s2">economics politics and cultures being</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:21.010" style="s2">distinct layers that feed back into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.650" end="00:16:23.110" style="s2">very complex fashion but that if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.010" end="00:16:24.970" style="s2">have a financial crisis you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.110" end="00:16:26.589" style="s2">allow that financial crisis to happen at</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.970" end="00:16:28.750" style="s2">the finance level and while it will have</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.589" end="00:16:30.310" style="s2">impacts at the economic level it may not</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.750" end="00:16:31.570" style="s2">necessarily have any meaningful impact</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.310" end="00:16:33.250" style="s2">at the political level</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.570" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">even strengthen the political level or</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.250" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">you can do what we did which was you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.640" end="00:16:41.950" style="s2">actually more or less bail out well both</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:44.440" style="s2">metaphorically and practically bail out</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.950" end="00:16:46.840" style="s2">the financial level by spending cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.440" end="00:16:49.780" style="s2">currency meaning breaking people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.840" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">underlying trust at the political level</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.780" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">and then ultimately even at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:55.270" style="s2">level which is to say people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:57.760" style="s2">being part of the same cultural fabric</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.270" end="00:16:59.770" style="s2">Greece for example I think has had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.760" end="00:17:01.930" style="s2">of that then of course again watching</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.770" end="00:17:03.940" style="s2">that in real time so again at a place of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.930" end="00:17:06.040" style="s2">being able to be front and center with</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.940" end="00:17:09.250" style="s2">the unfurling of reality and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.040" end="00:17:10.930" style="s2">having skin in the game my large pile of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.250" end="00:17:13.089" style="s2">money that I&#39;d made by being a tech</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.930" end="00:17:14.199" style="s2">entrepreneur became a smaller pile of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.089" end="00:17:17.290" style="s2">money as a result of the financial</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.199" end="00:17:17.740" style="s2">crisis I wasn&#39;t with the red terminus</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.290" end="00:17:18.940" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.740" end="00:17:20.290" style="s2">I was not disinterested I was quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.940" end="00:17:22.839" style="s2">interested in a bit pissed off to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.290" end="00:17:24.220" style="s2">perfectly frank and I got even more</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.839" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">pissed off as I continued watched him</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.220" end="00:17:28.050" style="s2">what was happening because it was to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:31.300" style="s2">at least now increasingly obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.050" end="00:17:34.210" style="s2">the choices that we were being made at</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.300" end="00:17:36.460" style="s2">the level of how our collective choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.210" end="00:17:40.690" style="s2">making worked let&#39;s say for example at</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">the level politics were bad like</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.690" end="00:17:50.860" style="s2">actually bad like they would have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:52.900" style="s2">long-term negative consequences and just</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.860" end="00:17:54.280" style="s2">kept on going deeper and then I found</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.900" end="00:17:57.940" style="s2">myself in a situation where I had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.280" end="00:17:59.560" style="s2">series of significant oh where I</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.940" end="00:18:01.930" style="s2">would have conversations with people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.560" end="00:18:04.150" style="s2">were really like the expert in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.930" end="00:18:06.970" style="s2">particular domain of interest say for</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.150" end="00:18:09.790" style="s2">example nuclear proliferation or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.970" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">concentration of estrogen in amphibians</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.790" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">like very narrow specific domains and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:20.170" style="s2">had probably overpaid about a year a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:23.650" style="s2">series of conversations each one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.170" end="00:18:25.300" style="s2">which was things are really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.650" end="00:18:28.740" style="s2">like there&#39;s something going on that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.300" end="00:18:31.180" style="s2">way bad like but nuclear proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.740" end="00:18:33.640" style="s2">the likelihood that we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.180" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">to keep the world from having a quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.640" end="00:18:38.260" style="s2">significant bad nuclear event of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.230" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">next decade is very low like 5% like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:41.140" style="s2">sitting there was like the three experts</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:42.190" style="s2">in the world on that question they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.140" end="00:18:43.810" style="s2">all a lot not in their heads saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.190" end="00:18:45.130" style="s2">this is like they were this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.810" end="00:18:47.080" style="s2">really a serious</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.130" end="00:18:48.700" style="s2">and then it&#39;s taking literally one step</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.080" end="00:18:51.450" style="s2">back and noticing that that fact does</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.700" end="00:18:54.820" style="s2">not seem to propagate out of that room</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.450" end="00:18:56.380" style="s2">and then beginning to you know get my</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.429" end="00:20:39.549" style="s2">making let&#39;s take what might we be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:42.190" style="s2">to do and this gave rise to a project</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.029" end="00:20:47.020" style="s2">actually kind of neat because they were</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.320" end="00:20:57.610" style="s2">dissolved the project in I think 2013 or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.049" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">so maybe 2014</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.610" end="00:21:01.180" style="s2">and the fact that the concepts have</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.320" end="00:21:22.630" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to canoe so you have from</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:24.670" style="s2">one oar and you have to have the effort</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.670" end="00:21:28.360" style="s2">into one the water and pulling it not</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">tipping over the boat so that&#39;s a a set</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.360" end="00:21:32.770" style="s2">of functions a set of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:34.690" style="s2">perception and actuation capacity share</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.770" end="00:21:36.100" style="s2">to have some sensitivity to how your</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.100" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">and how to buy higher arms and moving</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.750" end="00:21:43.090" style="s2">the orange the water but as individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.780" end="00:21:44.380" style="s2">as it as a body which is coherent it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.090" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">relatively straightforward thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.380" end="00:21:47.650" style="s2">and you can notice this when you go from</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.650" end="00:21:51.400" style="s2">rowboat but once you add the second war</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:52.900" style="s2">it takes a little bit of time to figure</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.400" end="00:21:53.620" style="s2">out how to get them all together but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.900" end="00:21:55.420" style="s2">too long</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.620" end="00:21:57.220" style="s2">you can become coherent you can bring</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.140" end="00:22:13.450" style="s2">wholeness of that you&#39;ve integrated that</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.450" end="00:22:19.030" style="s2">you can now actuate ruin the boat but</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.110" end="00:22:21.340" style="s2">now you add another person into the boat</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.030" end="00:22:23.920" style="s2">and notice that there&#39;s a significant</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.340" end="00:22:26.620" style="s2">difference there that two people rowing</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:56.020" style="s2">into coherence and you may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.050" end="00:22:57.340" style="s2">scale that to say three people but at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.020" end="00:22:59.680" style="s2">certain point you actually start seeing</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.880" end="00:23:42.260" style="s2">what happens is you now become a</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.380" end="00:25:22.740" style="s2">the blue church emerged in the context</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">of having to figure out how to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.740" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">all of these changes in generate</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:29.700" style="s2">coherence how do we get all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:32.010" style="s2">people with these new capacities to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.700" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">able to make sense of the world in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.010" end="00:25:35.130" style="s2">fashion that is able to then make</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">choices together and to act effectively</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.130" end="00:25:41.460" style="s2">right that&#39;s the question and the blue</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.230" style="s2">church developed to be the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.460" end="00:25:44.730" style="s2">that question and so it developed the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.230" end="00:25:48.049" style="s2">ability to say for example use the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.730" end="00:25:51.750" style="s2">education system to establish an</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.049" end="00:25:58.039" style="s2">embodied sense of vertical meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.750" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">hierarchy the idea that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.039" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">better at others in knowing certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:06.030" style="s2">kinds of things we can find them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:08.070" style="s2">then we empower them to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.030" end="00:26:10.140" style="s2">hierarchical Authority in the structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.070" end="00:26:13.380" style="s2">that we&#39;re in and I should say this by</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.140" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">the way both formally and informally you</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.380" end="00:26:18.059" style="s2">know the role of being in class is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.590" style="s2">teaching that whether the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.059" end="00:26:21.720" style="s2">story of the of the class whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.590" end="00:26:23.929" style="s2"> in the class is the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.720" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">the student is the teachers in charge</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.929" end="00:26:30.419" style="s2">our job is just to listen and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:32.190" style="s2">are smart and they get to be teachers or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.419" end="00:26:35.820" style="s2">in charge right that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.190" end="00:26:36.870" style="s2">the story of school it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.820" end="00:26:38.690" style="s2">that first part that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.870" end="00:26:41.250" style="s2">relationship between authority and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.690" end="00:26:42.929" style="s2">receptor that has a broadcast modality</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.250" end="00:26:45.600" style="s2">so the blue church is very broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.929" end="00:26:47.640" style="s2">across its entire mode so what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:26:50.549" style="s2">a broadcast of course is exemplified in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.640" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">television which is to say that some</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.549" end="00:26:56.730" style="s2">small number of people get to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">a very very large number of people get</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.730" end="00:27:01.770" style="s2">to listen this is very different and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">then say but we&#39;re doing right here and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.770" end="00:27:05.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s symmetric well of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:06.539" style="s2">the one speaking in principle there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.130" end="00:27:08.429" style="s2">nothing about this conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.539" end="00:27:09.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be perfectly symmetric but in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.429" end="00:27:12.600" style="s2">television and any kind of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.780" end="00:27:14.610" style="s2">modality structurally that way so Walter</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:16.710" style="s2">Cronkite tells the news and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.610" end="00:27:20.390" style="s2">else watches it and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.710" end="00:27:20.390" style="s2">passivity there like my job is not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.409" end="00:27:28.200" style="s2">perceive what&#39;s going on make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.809" end="00:27:30.749" style="s2">it and then express it in the world my</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.200" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">job is to see the story that I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.749" end="00:27:36.359" style="s2">and be able to then express that story</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:39.299" style="s2">effectively in the society that I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.359" end="00:27:43.169" style="s2">and I call this good sense the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.299" end="00:27:45.119" style="s2">of good sense and you see an emerging</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.169" end="00:27:47.659" style="s2">mesh of good sense you know who are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.119" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">authoritative speakers whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.659" end="00:27:52.979" style="s2">NBC News or they&#39;re the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:54.210" style="s2">and there&#39;s a diversity of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.979" end="00:27:55.739" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.210" end="00:27:57.779" style="s2">perspectives in the authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.739" end="00:27:59.399" style="s2">frameworks the blue church recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.779" end="00:28:01.409" style="s2">the necessity of having eyes and ears</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.399" end="00:28:02.879" style="s2">but it also recognizes the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.409" end="00:28:04.499" style="s2">having coherence so there&#39;s a diversity</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.879" end="00:28:08.970" style="s2">but there&#39;s a diversity within a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.499" end="00:28:11.220" style="s2">particular boundary and so when you show</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:14.129" style="s2">up in society if you are speaking good</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.220" end="00:28:15.869" style="s2">sense if your expressions are of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.129" end="00:28:17.190" style="s2">sort that everybody else has broadly</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.869" end="00:28:20.190" style="s2">been hearing or the authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.190" end="00:28:23.549" style="s2">statements then you&#39;re showing up well</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.190" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">and if you aren&#39;t then you&#39;re showing up</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.549" end="00:28:27.090" style="s2">poorly and you&#39;ll notice that I can you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.309" style="s2">begin to say things that are contour</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.090" end="00:28:30.899" style="s2">narrative in a deep way even today much</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.309" end="00:28:33.419" style="s2">less so now though than like 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.899" end="00:28:35.340" style="s2">ago then you will notice an discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.419" end="00:28:37.529" style="s2">people get uncomfortable viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.340" end="00:28:38.700" style="s2">physically and you will notice that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.529" end="00:28:40.349" style="s2">discomfort of this we physically and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.700" end="00:28:42.090" style="s2">then you&#39;ll stop doing it and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.349" end="00:28:43.830" style="s2">a nice policing mechanism it just at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.090" end="00:28:45.169" style="s2">cocktail party set particularly in cases</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.830" end="00:28:49.169" style="s2">like say New York Los Angeles Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.169" end="00:28:52.169" style="s2">San Francisco or the the elite cachet is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.169" end="00:28:53.899" style="s2">the most important where the choice of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.169" end="00:28:56.519" style="s2">social success is the choice between</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.899" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">being elevated in the hierarchy or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.519" end="00:29:01.349" style="s2">then good sense becomes even more</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:02.669" style="s2">selfless and so a good opinion it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.349" end="00:29:06.239" style="s2">good opinion thank you thank you good</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.669" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">opinion and it&#39;s actually interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.239" end="00:29:09.239" style="s2">make that distinction because the effort</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:12.889" style="s2">of the blue church is actually provide</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.239" end="00:29:16.229" style="s2">good sense and what is the truth about</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.889" end="00:29:18.119" style="s2">the war in Vietnam but of course what it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.229" end="00:29:20.129" style="s2">currently produces good opinion what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.119" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">our perspective and then make sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.129" end="00:29:24.239" style="s2">everybody more or less has that because</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.529" style="s2">then you can actually have choices you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.239" end="00:29:27.720" style="s2">can actually make choices together if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.529" end="00:29:29.519" style="s2">all more or less agree this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.720" end="00:29:31.080" style="s2">nature of reality and we more or less</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.519" end="00:29:33.019" style="s2">agree that these kinds of actions will</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.080" end="00:29:36.119" style="s2">lead to effective results then where</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.019" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">we&#39;re rowing the boat to the coxswains</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.119" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re pushing we have a menu that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.509" style="s2">has six buttons pick which button you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:44.190" style="s2">like to push you have choice no question</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.509" end="00:29:45.389" style="s2">but it&#39;s in a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.190" end="00:29:46.740" style="s2">it&#39;s within a boundary condition that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.389" end="00:29:49.470" style="s2">works and then what happens is when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.740" end="00:29:51.690" style="s2">push the button it actuates a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.470" end="00:29:53.940" style="s2">of stuff we&#39;ve all decided that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.690" end="00:29:56.940" style="s2">going to have a war on poverty so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.940" end="00:29:59.190" style="s2">turned the dial on the world war 2 era</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.940" end="00:30:01.860" style="s2">bureaucratic machinery that took us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.190" end="00:30:04.049" style="s2">the moon that built the interstate</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.860" end="00:30:06.120" style="s2">highway system and we say ok go out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.049" end="00:30:07.620" style="s2">point that engine at poverty we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.120" end="00:30:10.019" style="s2">start building the welfare state go</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.620" end="00:30:11.460" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what they did and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.019" end="00:30:13.799" style="s2">sometimes it worked you pointed it at</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.460" end="00:30:15.750" style="s2">the moon it goes to the moon imported</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.799" end="00:30:17.220" style="s2">poverty and it didn&#39;t work wonderfully</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.750" end="00:30:21.629" style="s2">created a mess and that tells us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:23.210" style="s2">by the way so I guess kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.629" end="00:30:25.350" style="s2">that like that&#39;s the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.210" end="00:30:27.929" style="s2">there&#39;s an in treatment because this</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.350" end="00:30:30.929" style="s2">structure has Harvard is kind of at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.929" end="00:30:33.990" style="s2">top and then you have the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.929" end="00:30:35.789" style="s2">Ivy League and Oxford and Cambridge I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.990" end="00:30:37.110" style="s2">sad to say that the UK lost their</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.799" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">totally global and for a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:58.470" style="s2">time that in fact actually functionally</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:31:01.950" style="s2">global when that period from 88 to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.470" end="00:31:04.860" style="s2">1999 was a period where the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.950" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">was a true hegemon and was doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.860" end="00:31:08.549" style="s2">well constitutes the blue church he</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.830" end="00:31:14.100" style="s2">hierarchy in the blue church I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.299" end="00:31:19.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the question you&#39;re asking who is</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.110" end="00:33:24.460" style="s2">start shooting the they&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.420" end="00:33:25.570" style="s2">lot to talk about because there&#39;s only</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.570" end="00:33:30.460" style="s2">which is business and politics but</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:32.260" style="s2">mostly business so they start talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.460" end="00:33:34.030" style="s2">about business and it turns out that if</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.260" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity for Deutsche</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.030" end="00:33:37.420" style="s2">Telekom and British Telecom to sell</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.800" end="00:33:42.220" style="s2">this guy will run you&#39;d be surprised how</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.930" end="00:33:44.680" style="s2">rapidly that gets surfaced and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.220" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">identified as a thing to do now growing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.680" end="00:33:47.950" style="s2">up in the Texas Hill Country I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.020" style="s2">having this kind of conversations and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.950" end="00:33:52.150" style="s2">think most people don&#39;t so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.020" end="00:33:53.350" style="s2">example that that&#39;s an artifact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.150" end="00:33:55.480" style="s2">emerges out of the notion of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.350" end="00:33:57.400" style="s2">church that once you have a vertical</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:33:59.620" style="s2">hierarchy and then by definition you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.400" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">have a finite amount of time you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.620" end="00:34:02.050" style="s2">clusters of these people who are hanging</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">together and then by the way a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.050" end="00:34:06.850" style="s2">that human complexity creeps back in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:08.710" style="s2">they start having clubs cliques they</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.850" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">start caring about each other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.710" end="00:34:10.179" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing a lot of groupthink</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.179" end="00:34:14.260" style="s2">opinion stress to really solidify and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.010" end="00:34:18.490" style="s2">they become blind to what&#39;s not within</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.260" end="00:34:21.010" style="s2">that a good opinion there&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.490" end="00:34:24.730" style="s2">reasons to believe that the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.010" end="00:34:27.819" style="s2">is done we mean that it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.730" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">senescence stage and senescence has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.819" end="00:34:30.730" style="s2">characteristic where when you move into</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.730" end="00:34:34.659" style="s2">downhill pretty quickly so I&#39;m expecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.829" end="00:34:37.690" style="s2">to see the blue church sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.659" end="00:34:41.399" style="s2">increasingly obviously failing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.690" end="00:34:46.440" style="s2">increasingly obviously losing the</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:55.659" style="s2">are going to be going ah that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.559" end="00:34:57.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.659" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a thing and it&#39;s kind of doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.160" end="00:34:59.619" style="s2">something and maybe parts of it are</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">still good but it&#39;s not the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.619" end="00:35:04.359" style="s2">and it seems to be increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">up and in the meantime looking around</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.359" end="00:35:08.440" style="s2">going okay now what that&#39;s the key I run</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.059" end="00:35:46.540" style="s2">starting around 2000 ish particularly</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.740" end="00:35:47.740" style="s2">accelerating you can explain a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.540" end="00:35:50.200" style="s2">the things that happened it seemed very</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.660" end="00:35:56.980" style="s2">building up behind the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.150" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">then exploding because it had nowhere to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.980" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">to go well what we&#39;re it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:08.589" style="s2">gaps in the blue church so blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.740" end="00:36:10.540" style="s2">and actuation gaps that&#39;s one side so it</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.010" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">and state is pretty good here so blue</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.740" end="00:37:39.550" style="s2">whole the whole thing but we&#39;re a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.260" end="00:37:39.550" style="s2">the way is there for sure it&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.300" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">certainly single-digit years and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.460" end="00:37:46.970" style="s2">possibly with double-digit years for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:50.860" style="s2">whole thing to come together to a point</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.970" end="00:37:50.860" style="s2">where it&#39;s transition formally</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.030" end="00:37:55.270" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about an ocean where</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.870" end="00:37:56.830" style="s2">broadcast is faced with a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.270" end="00:37:58.690" style="s2">different problems and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.830" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">about it both from the outside and with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.690" end="00:38:05.740" style="s2">us three domains so from one perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">broadcast has limitations in its</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.740" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">capacity to perceive and respond to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">reality just it&#39;s pretty obvious but if</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.410" end="00:38:17.230" style="s2">you think about what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:19.390" style="s2">every layer of the hierarchy has to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.230" end="00:38:20.830" style="s2">compress the information you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.390" end="00:38:23.380" style="s2">were out in the field seeing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.830" end="00:38:25.660" style="s2">going on with say the rain forest</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.380" end="00:38:27.010" style="s2">insects and you&#39;re porting it up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s at a think-tank who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.010" end="00:38:29.890" style="s2">reporting it up to a policy maker who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:32.980" style="s2">porting it up to a legislative decision</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.890" end="00:38:35.260" style="s2">maker they&#39;re having to simplify a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.980" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">to go up the chain right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.260" end="00:38:39.850" style="s2">losing enormous amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:43.600" style="s2">which means that you can do so much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.850" end="00:38:45.370" style="s2">kind of like if you imagine a was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.600" end="00:38:47.350" style="s2">in the 80s they had those glass spheres</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.370" end="00:38:49.390" style="s2">if you touch some lightning bolt to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.350" end="00:38:52.330" style="s2">touch your fingers so the sphere is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.390" end="00:38:54.250" style="s2">whole thing and the broadcast modality</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.330" end="00:38:56.110" style="s2">is one of those lightning bolts so it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.250" end="00:38:57.670" style="s2">kind of like maneuvers around the sphere</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.110" end="00:38:59.710" style="s2">but it can only handle that much and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.670" end="00:39:01.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not a lot and that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.710" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">nature of the structure like just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.720" end="00:39:06.970" style="s2">structure that has that kind of geometry</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:09.580" style="s2">to it can only perceive a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.970" end="00:39:11.170" style="s2">fraction from the bottom to the top and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.580" end="00:39:13.090" style="s2">then by the way the same thing happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.170" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2">at the way down the directives that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.090" end="00:39:19.000" style="s2">given from the top have to be they have</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:22.930" style="s2">to be relatively simple because as they</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.000" end="00:39:24.790" style="s2">go down there&#39;s a an expansion of scope</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.930" end="00:39:26.680" style="s2">which increases the ads basically noise</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.790" end="00:39:28.330" style="s2">because the new person then below has to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.680" end="00:39:30.040" style="s2">add a whole bunch of specificity to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.330" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">to be done and it gives it gets handed</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">down you get more and more noise and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">the this means at the top the directors</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:38.020" style="s2">that come down have to be really broad</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.670" style="s2">and simple and at the bottom the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.020" end="00:39:40.780" style="s2">divergence between actually happens out</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.670" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">in the world what was intended to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.780" end="00:39:44.140" style="s2">top is actually quite large and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:45.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a lack of elegance and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.140" end="00:39:47.830" style="s2">precision and you get a compression</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.970" end="00:39:49.420" style="s2">going up and so this means that it has</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.830" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2">certain capacities it can actually get</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.420" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">us to the moon turns out that&#39;s a domain</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:52.360" style="s2">that&#39;s well within the scope of what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:56.860" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.360" end="00:39:58.630" style="s2">it cannot solve Clement . period and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.860" end="00:40:01.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of other things that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.630" end="00:40:03.700" style="s2">solve so that&#39;s one boundary condition</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.260" end="00:40:04.539" style="s2">the other boundary condition is to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.700" end="00:40:06.759" style="s2">transition between</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.539" end="00:40:10.599" style="s2">broadcast in digital which is happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.759" end="00:40:11.979" style="s2">after the blue church gave us digital we</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.599" end="00:40:15.519" style="s2">moved from an analogue world to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.979" end="00:40:15.849" style="s2">digital world during its period of being</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.849" end="00:40:24.749" style="s2">and when I say digital here I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.029" end="00:40:30.789" style="s2">say very specifically what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.749" end="00:40:33.519" style="s2">Network symmetric decentralized so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.789" end="00:40:35.079" style="s2">a the fact that being digital is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.519" end="00:40:36.219" style="s2">important it&#39;s actually very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.079" end="00:40:37.989" style="s2">important but it&#39;s not the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.219" end="00:40:41.799" style="s2">I&#39;m focusing on right here I&#39;m comparing</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.989" end="00:40:44.769" style="s2">broadcast to this network decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.799" end="00:40:46.209" style="s2">not analog to digital by the way both</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.769" end="00:40:49.059" style="s2">are true but we&#39;re just gonna focus at</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.209" end="00:40:51.400" style="s2">the network to broadcast peace so what</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.059" end="00:40:53.979" style="s2">happens is is that a network</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.400" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">intelligence a network system for sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.979" end="00:40:58.839" style="s2">making and choice making is different</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">full-stop let&#39;s just start there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.839" end="00:41:03.309" style="s2">just different and it has different</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.049" style="s2">capacities has different ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.309" end="00:41:06.579" style="s2">information from the edge process and</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.579" end="00:41:11.409" style="s2">back out to the edge and it&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.409" end="00:41:15.959" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with it&#39;s a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.959" end="00:41:21.630" style="s2">fundamentally more available to being</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.109" end="00:41:40.289" style="s2">if the blue church is a really really</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.199" end="00:41:52.749" style="s2">see he&#39;s gonna be good when he gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.309" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">strong and gets bigger maybe when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.749" end="00:41:56.499" style="s2">14 he&#39;ll be able to punch this guy out</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:58.779" style="s2">but in the meantime he&#39;s not for it oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.499" end="00:42:00.999" style="s2">but in the meantime it&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.779" end="00:42:03.699" style="s2">match if you look at it and say hey wait</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.999" end="00:42:06.630" style="s2">it in terms of lifting heavy weights the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.699" end="00:42:08.890" style="s2">blue church is gonna win in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.630" end="00:42:10.569" style="s2">being able to answer a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.890" end="00:42:11.679" style="s2">at least appear to be able to answer a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.569" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">lot of questions the blue church looks</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.679" end="00:42:16.059" style="s2">like it&#39;s quite robust if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.630" end="00:42:17.809" style="s2">look at the emerging decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.059" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">collective intelligence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.809" end="00:42:22.459" style="s2">getting to happen on the Internet it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:24.259" style="s2">mostly looks like gaps they mostly looks</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.459" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">like it&#39;s doing stuff in the gaps that</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.259" end="00:42:26.949" style="s2">are being left behind by the bleachers</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">just look like they can do anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.949" end="00:42:30.949" style="s2">holistic and when it&#39;s endeavor to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.630" end="00:42:34.969" style="s2">something holistic likes to the queue</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.949" end="00:42:36.739" style="s2">and on phenomenon it looks insane in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.969" end="00:42:40.519" style="s2">kind of its and if you&#39;ve ever seen an</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.739" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">absolute newborn baby in its body it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.519" end="00:42:44.269" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:45.709" style="s2">his limbs are flailing wildly its heads</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.269" end="00:42:47.299" style="s2">rolling around so eyes are rolling in</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.709" end="00:42:48.739" style="s2">his head because it hasn&#39;t figured how</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.299" end="00:42:50.089" style="s2">to wire itself up yet that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.739" end="00:42:52.219" style="s2">happening in the network collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.089" end="00:42:54.699" style="s2">intelligence so there&#39;s a gap there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.219" end="00:42:54.699" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.109" end="00:43:00.630" style="s2">we talked about discernment and how</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.719" end="00:43:02.519" style="s2">that&#39;s a key skill in decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.630" end="00:43:05.249" style="s2">media compared to broadcast media oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.519" end="00:43:06.450" style="s2">absolutely so so now the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.249" end="00:43:12.390" style="s2">conversation which i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.450" end="00:43:14.039" style="s2">nice is turning to now what and how so</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.390" end="00:43:16.859" style="s2">the answer now what is decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.039" end="00:43:18.529" style="s2">active intelligence great how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.859" end="00:43:24.569" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.529" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">so I said first step is know that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.569" end="00:43:30.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know know that most of your habits</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:32.579" style="s2">are blue church habits in fact most your</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.900" end="00:43:34.969" style="s2">habit even gamej habits but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.579" end="00:43:36.569" style="s2">leave it up to church right now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.969" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">certainly everything you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.569" end="00:43:39.269" style="s2">formerly taught and everything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:41.640" style="s2">learned from formal institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.269" end="00:43:44.749" style="s2">almost all those are gonna be wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.640" end="00:43:44.749" style="s2">you have to actually step into a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.279" end="00:43:54.859" style="s2">child&#39;s mind place and as a rule of</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.470" end="00:51:09.720" style="s2">system if every node is doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.740" end="00:51:11.640" style="s2">by the way those two recursion if every</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.720" end="00:51:13.559" style="s2">node is primarily focused initially on</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.640" end="00:51:16.170" style="s2">building us discernment and skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.559" end="00:51:17.579" style="s2">in doing this process alright then what</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.170" end="00:51:19.260" style="s2">ends up happening is the network is</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.579" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2"> amazing</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.260" end="00:51:24.059" style="s2">and making sense of subtlety alright you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:26.819" style="s2">can take the perception these subtle</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.059" end="00:51:27.050" style="s2">broad implicit pattern recognizers that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.819" end="00:51:30.770" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.050" end="00:51:32.810" style="s2">so gifted with and grabbed very vague</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.770" end="00:51:34.910" style="s2">and weird not quite knowing what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.810" end="00:51:36.980" style="s2">on thing put it into the system and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.910" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">after a couple of turns it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.980" end="00:51:41.930" style="s2">reified to a very crisp clarity that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:43.160" style="s2">be shared so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.930" end="00:51:45.080" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to accomplish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.160" end="00:51:46.930" style="s2">that process and you notice how much of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.080" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">a burden is placed on the individual now</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.930" end="00:51:52.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the broadcast modality</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:54.140" style="s2">where most of your agency is limited to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.970" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">a very narrow band and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.140" end="00:51:56.690" style="s2">relying on the causal structure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:51:58.820" style="s2">you&#39;re embedded in to do almost all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.690" end="00:52:00.650" style="s2">work in the decentralized collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.820" end="00:52:02.780" style="s2">intelligence for to actually work almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.650" end="00:52:04.460" style="s2">all of the agency is actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.780" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">individuals you have to have really</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.460" end="00:52:10.700" style="s2">really effective responsible individuals</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:12.620" style="s2">and by responsible I mean is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.700" end="00:52:13.580" style="s2">they&#39;re able to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.620" end="00:52:15.170" style="s2">environment in the way that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.580" end="00:52:18.650" style="s2">about they&#39;re not reacting they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.170" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">shifting to a causal domain they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.650" end="00:52:21.500" style="s2">saying what they&#39;re supposed to say or</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:23.480" style="s2">rejecting because they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.500" end="00:52:29.510" style="s2">reject they&#39;re listening and refining</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.480" end="00:52:31.220" style="s2">and doing the work of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.510" end="00:52:32.750" style="s2">think about collaboration how</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.220" end="00:52:35.930" style="s2">collaboration works you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.750" end="00:52:37.730" style="s2">collaborating on a song if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.930" end="00:52:39.260" style="s2">partners we&#39;re really collaborating I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.730" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">gonna be like ah and I just had this</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.260" end="00:52:44.420" style="s2">crazy sense and I&#39;d like to play it</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">terrible sound but you&#39;re listening very</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.420" end="00:52:47.720" style="s2">closely right and you&#39;re good at it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.180" style="s2">you&#39;re good at listening very closely</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.720" end="00:52:52.760" style="s2">and you&#39;re like you know what is it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.180" end="00:52:54.800" style="s2">this and you play it back and what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.760" end="00:52:57.650" style="s2">play back is actually closer to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.800" end="00:52:59.450" style="s2">feeling like oh yes more like that more</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.650" end="00:53:01.130" style="s2">like that and then like okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.450" end="00:53:02.330" style="s2">this but now I&#39;m actually little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.130" end="00:53:03.860" style="s2">better I because it&#39;s more clearing me</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.330" end="00:53:05.210" style="s2">because what you did was you refine it</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.860" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">and expressed it back to me with it I</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.210" end="00:53:10.010" style="s2">couldn&#39;t perceive myself but once I saw</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.870" style="s2">it pop that&#39;s insight you just gave me</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:14.360" style="s2">an insight collaboratively collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.870" end="00:53:15.620" style="s2">insight so now I take a night out put</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.360" end="00:53:17.240" style="s2">something back to you and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.620" end="00:53:19.250" style="s2">like oh yeah I totally get it and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.240" end="00:53:21.590" style="s2">you drop into it and now we&#39;re now a</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.250" end="00:53:23.330" style="s2">collective intelligence coherence is now</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.590" end="00:53:25.100" style="s2">happening in the flu and collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.330" end="00:53:27.050" style="s2">between us and the things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.100" end="00:53:28.130" style="s2">produced are vastly more than what</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.050" end="00:53:30.380" style="s2">either one of us could have done</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.130" end="00:53:31.700" style="s2">separately now of course this requires</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.380" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2">that you have developed a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.700" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">of discernment I&#39;ve developed a certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:36.410" style="s2">level of discernment we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:38.180" style="s2">relationship that allows us to actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.410" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">use that and we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.180" end="00:53:41.130" style="s2">means what the requirements are and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:43.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve also built a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.130" end="00:53:45.300" style="s2">skillfulness and expression so that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.470" end="00:53:47.400" style="s2">not creating noise and expressing it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.300" end="00:53:50.100" style="s2">actually making it more signal when I</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.400" end="00:53:52.230" style="s2">express it more real or true I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.100" end="00:53:55.980" style="s2">increasing the truth of the expression</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.230" end="00:53:58.380" style="s2">of the quality so it&#39;s a pretty like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.980" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">think pretty concrete example that many</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.380" end="00:54:01.500" style="s2">people might be able to grasp and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:02.940" style="s2">idea is that that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.500" end="00:54:07.610" style="s2">we&#39;re here trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.940" end="00:54:07.610" style="s2">become real collaborators at scale and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.590" end="00:54:12.840" style="s2">well we&#39;re getting better at it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.430" end="00:54:15.120" style="s2">actually learning it like we&#39;re noticing</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.840" end="00:54:17.190" style="s2">for example that our most natural</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.120" end="00:54:18.810" style="s2">humaneness has a lot of capability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.190" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">separate from non</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.810" end="00:54:27.090" style="s2">authenticity from artifice and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:28.280" style="s2">authenticity can at least feel true I</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.090" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">mean I feel good</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.280" end="00:54:31.560" style="s2">artifice can do a really good job of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:34.770" style="s2">feeling good but art but authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.560" end="00:54:36.860" style="s2">can feel true even when it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.770" end="00:54:39.840" style="s2">clusterfuck or even was not done</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.860" end="00:54:41.850" style="s2">exquisitely particularly it&#39;s hard if it</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.840" end="00:54:43.470" style="s2">feels really true and authentic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.850" end="00:54:45.780" style="s2">something in there that your basic like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.470" end="00:54:48.330" style="s2">deep humanist is like all right I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.780" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">work with that where do we go from here</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.330" end="00:54:54.060" style="s2">and by the way I&#39;m interested and by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:56.130" style="s2">with this openness hey you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.060" end="00:54:58.280" style="s2">just figuring this out I&#39;m trying what</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.130" end="00:54:59.880" style="s2">do you got and you send it back to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.280" end="00:55:03.900" style="s2">symmetrically because we&#39;re available</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.880" end="00:55:05.310" style="s2">and I listen and I hear you then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.900" end="00:55:06.780" style="s2">actually created a relationship that has</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.310" end="00:55:09.000" style="s2">that feeling of trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.780" end="00:55:10.860" style="s2">relationship which then creates an open</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.000" end="00:55:11.970" style="s2">channel to do more of it now of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.860" end="00:55:13.170" style="s2">we&#39;re late we&#39;re a limited</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.970" end="00:55:14.730" style="s2">we&#39;re limited by our discernment so</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.170" end="00:55:16.740" style="s2">we&#39;re always going to have to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.730" end="00:55:19.230" style="s2">work on improving the quality of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.740" end="00:55:21.330" style="s2">discernment in all the modalities that</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.230" end="00:55:23.370" style="s2">happen to be happening and we are really</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.330" end="00:55:24.570" style="s2">limited by our capacity to express we</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.370" end="00:55:27.870" style="s2">have to get better and better being able</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.570" end="00:55:32.220" style="s2">to express with clarity with elegance</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.870" end="00:55:34.290" style="s2">and width I want to say it&#39;s fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.220" end="00:55:36.930" style="s2">meaning we don&#39;t want to put stuff in it</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.290" end="00:55:38.130" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t belong in it I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.930" end="00:55:41.390" style="s2">something that there&#39;s also subtly</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.130" end="00:55:43.740" style="s2">manipulative I just gotta tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.390" end="00:55:45.510" style="s2">pure truth two degrees in which I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.740" end="00:55:46.740" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna it up but at least I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.510" end="00:55:48.300" style="s2">not it up with stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.740" end="00:55:51.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be there at all so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.300" end="00:55:52.869" style="s2">just expressing it and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.150" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">about that is very good news</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.869" end="00:55:56.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s extremely powerful process and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:57.759" style="s2">the process of collaboration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.710" end="00:56:01.479" style="s2">available now because we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.759" end="00:56:03.940" style="s2">connected to each other is unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.479" end="00:56:05.469" style="s2">and that has the capacity to solve all</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.940" end="00:56:06.700" style="s2">the problems for dealing with that kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.469" end="00:56:08.739" style="s2">of a decentralized collective</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.060" end="00:58:13.210" style="s2">should be noticing that you&#39;re good at</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.210" end="00:58:17.230" style="s2">should be doing is notice sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.430" end="00:58:18.940" style="s2">fact so that the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.230" end="00:58:21.270" style="s2">begins the process of being able to</p>

<p begin="00:58:21.270" end="00:58:27.820" style="s2">simulation and artifice and towards</p>

<p begin="00:58:39.250" end="00:58:43.630" style="s2">build capacity you&#39;re building capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.580" end="00:58:45.160" style="s2">so these people are gonna do better so</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.630" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a good choice for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.160" end="00:58:51.000" style="s2">it is a better choice for everyone to be</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.000" end="00:58:56.830" style="s2">the more people who are playing it</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.530" end="00:58:58.540" style="s2">better the more obvious that is because</p>

<p begin="00:58:58.540" end="00:59:02.200" style="s2">showing up over here and there&#39;s a rate</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.200" end="00:59:07.180" style="s2">that once it starts to hit is stretched</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.510" end="00:59:09.430" style="s2">to achieve criticality escape velocity</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.180" end="00:59:14.860" style="s2">and just blows past this old structure</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.430" end="00:59:16.090" style="s2">very rapidly no so there we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.860" end="00:59:18.670" style="s2">I mean that metaphor of a 4 year old</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.090" end="00:59:21.100" style="s2">where this is if you want to play</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.670" end="00:59:24.070" style="s2">basketball you have an opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.830" end="00:59:30.370" style="s2">opportunity exists to have him on your</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.420" end="00:59:30.820" style="s2">team right now by the way and Michael</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.000" end="00:59:42.820" style="s2">at 12 like if you imagine five of the</p>
