<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:29.870" style="s2">can build their capacity and act</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.480" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">is doing wonderful work with that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.980" end="00:08:39.930" style="s2">I&#39;m glad to be able to help every now</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:42.990" style="s2">and then so thank you so much for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.930" end="00:08:44.790" style="s2">second webinar again also the way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.990" end="00:08:47.790" style="s2">this is coming together that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.790" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">actually possible to speak for me for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:53.130" style="s2">to speak in English and for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:08:55.590" style="s2">simultaneous translation into Portuguese</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.130" end="00:08:59.190" style="s2">and then simultaneous subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.590" end="00:09:01.170" style="s2">so you can follow the subtitles for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.190" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">as an example of what can happen when we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:05.580" style="s2">shift from competitive advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:07.710" style="s2">collaborative advantage which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.580" end="00:09:09.390" style="s2">one of the transitions that are at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.710" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">heart of moving towards regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.390" end="00:09:16.650" style="s2">cultures we can just do so much more if</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:20.610" style="s2">we work together and so as we said I</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.650" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">will start with a short well short half</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.610" end="00:09:28.110" style="s2">hour presentation and then I open up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:31.650" style="s2">questions and just looking how to share</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.110" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">my screen and this is the one I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.650" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">share and now it should work okay now it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">looks like I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got two screens</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:49.290" style="s2">here so if you see me looking off-center</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">it&#39;s because I&#39;m looking at the screen</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.290" end="00:09:55.650" style="s2">just slightly there the topic of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:59.190" style="s2">webinar is systemic bio-inspired</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.650" end="00:10:03.540" style="s2">design and it&#39;s part of a series of two</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:05.730" style="s2">webinars - as a warm-up - my visit to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.540" end="00:10:07.530" style="s2">Brazil and I&#39;m really looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.730" end="00:10:09.780" style="s2">this visit and March and giving a talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.530" end="00:10:11.490" style="s2">at good Institute and also a short</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.780" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">workshop at Curtin sitting you can find</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.490" end="00:10:20.570" style="s2">out more at the design Rehana at Evo</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:23.320" style="s2">org and just to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.570" end="00:10:26.690" style="s2">English that this webinar is not about</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.320" end="00:10:30.170" style="s2">pi inspired design in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.690" end="00:10:34.100" style="s2">biomimicry levels one and two which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.170" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">basically the examples of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.100" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">innovate new products that are inspired</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">by the way that nature with its 3.8 year</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:47.710" style="s2">eight billion year head start in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">research and development has innovated</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.710" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">wonderful solutions that we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:55.130" style="s2">from of course and the most important</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">thing here to reiterate from what I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.130" end="00:11:00.470" style="s2">in my last webinar is that while very</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:03.950" style="s2">often I think I just did it myself we</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.470" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">use language that says learning from</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.950" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">nature as if nature is something out</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:14.210" style="s2">there and we&#39;re somewhere separate from</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:16.520" style="s2">it the key internal reframing that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.210" end="00:11:19.400" style="s2">need to do to work regenerative ly is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.520" end="00:11:23.180" style="s2">first and foremost understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.400" end="00:11:26.690" style="s2">are nature and that at the very best we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.180" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">can design as nature creating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.690" end="00:11:33.410" style="s2">conducive to life and really that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:35.300" style="s2">this is about and and just briefly these</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.410" end="00:11:37.300" style="s2">examples here that that you&#39;ve got on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.300" end="00:11:41.060" style="s2">the screen at the moment are all</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.300" end="00:11:43.580" style="s2">biomimetic design innovations all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.060" end="00:11:46.250" style="s2">images are from my book so i also speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.580" end="00:11:49.190" style="s2">about the product design level but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.250" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">this webinar i wanted to focus more on</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.190" end="00:11:54.590" style="s2">the systemic level so as you can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:57.890" style="s2">here on the screen there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.590" end="00:12:00.970" style="s2">optimize the aerodynamics of a car and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.890" end="00:12:03.650" style="s2">the stability of a car following</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.970" end="00:12:07.670" style="s2">biological models there&#39;s ways to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.650" end="00:12:10.820" style="s2">fast swimming swimsuits or Hospital</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.670" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">interiors that don&#39;t allow bacteria to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.820" end="00:12:18.830" style="s2">attach mimicking the way that the shark</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:20.900" style="s2">skin is structured and we have all or</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.830" end="00:12:22.940" style="s2">many of us have seen how the wings of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.900" end="00:12:25.220" style="s2">airplanes can have tipped up at the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.940" end="00:12:27.980" style="s2">of the the wing over the last years</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.220" end="00:12:31.400" style="s2">because it makes them more aerodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.980" end="00:12:34.100" style="s2">more using less fuel and more stable and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.400" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">that&#39;s an innovation that is copied from</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.100" end="00:12:39.069" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:42.129" style="s2">of prey um so rather than staying with</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.069" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">the product design level I said I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.129" end="00:12:47.529" style="s2">to speak to you today about the third</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">level of biomimicry which is biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.529" end="00:12:52.439" style="s2">that is inspired by biological and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:56.220" style="s2">ecological processes and systems and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.439" end="00:13:00.009" style="s2">this map is a map of the world&#39;s biomes</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.220" end="00:13:02.529" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s a distribution map of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.009" end="00:13:07.089" style="s2">type of ecosystems that we have around</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.529" end="00:13:10.420" style="s2">the globe and as we begin to rematch the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.089" end="00:13:12.699" style="s2">human presence onto the biological and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.420" end="00:13:15.129" style="s2">ecological patterns of nature because</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.699" end="00:13:18.910" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of divorced ourselves from it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.129" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">through being somewhat overly focused of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.910" end="00:13:23.819" style="s2">what technology can do and not paying</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:26.769" style="s2">enough attention of how even our highest</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.819" end="00:13:29.439" style="s2">technology needs to fit into the life</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.769" end="00:13:32.199" style="s2">sustaining cycles of nature if we want</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.439" end="00:13:33.970" style="s2">to use it for any length of time and if</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.199" end="00:13:39.970" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to go extinct in a hurry</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:42.579" style="s2">and so this map of looking at where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:45.480" style="s2">key ecosystems are is a good point to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.579" end="00:13:49.000" style="s2">start of how to rematch ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.480" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">learning from nature how to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.000" end="00:13:56.350" style="s2">nature again and how to become a healing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:14:01.750" style="s2">regenerating regenerating influence on</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:26.819" style="s2">because a it shows how at night we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.189" end="00:14:29.350" style="s2">really light up the planet with our</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.350" end="00:14:34.930" style="s2">unfortunately is still by and large</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.930" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">and nuclear and if we want to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.199" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">the human presence on earth we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:44.589" style="s2">shift fundamentally from these energy</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.820" end="00:14:55.050" style="s2">also shows when you look at that just</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.310" end="00:14:57.540" style="s2">above the curvature of the globe you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.050" end="00:15:01.710" style="s2">that green line and it gives you an idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.540" end="00:15:04.140" style="s2">of how small or how how relatively load</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.710" end="00:15:08.010" style="s2">the atmosphere actually is and between</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.140" end="00:15:10.290" style="s2">the earth and that upper layer in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.010" end="00:15:12.360" style="s2">that layer of air is where everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.290" end="00:15:14.730" style="s2">that we&#39;ve ever done as a species has</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.360" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">taken place and all our actions work</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.730" end="00:15:19.800" style="s2">about from a very few exceptions when we</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:23.280" style="s2">travel beyond that sphere but all our</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.800" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2">actions have had consequences on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.280" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">living planet life as a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.220" end="00:15:31.320" style="s2">process that we&#39;re participating in and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">with the converging crises that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.320" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">coming at us we&#39;re now really challenged</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.420" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">to redesign our human impact on earth in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">such a way that we fit back into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:46.860" style="s2">system and that we heal this system so</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">the big question is this is another map</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.860" end="00:15:51.450" style="s2">of the earth built up from satellite</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">images and you can see that there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.450" end="00:15:56.490" style="s2">large areas that are deserts and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:58.440" style="s2">unfortunately because of human action</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.490" end="00:16:01.200" style="s2">over the last five thousand years we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.440" end="00:16:04.200" style="s2">have drastically increased the deserts</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.200" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">and the question is what would it take</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.200" end="00:16:09.960" style="s2">if we actually started to inhabit each</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:12.330" style="s2">of these diverse ecosystems that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.960" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2">previous map showed but do it in such a</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.850" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">the way we work with land so it is at</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.390" end="00:20:03.250" style="s2">its most bio productive because</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.400" end="00:20:27.490" style="s2">purposes but also it&#39;s important to not</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.160" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">see it as only utilitarian value its</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.490" end="00:20:33.040" style="s2">intrinsic value we need to be stewards</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">of the biodiversity of life in all these</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.930" end="00:20:48.340" style="s2">transformation because one thing we know</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.980" end="00:21:32.470" style="s2">talk about a lot but it might help to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.460" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">review what they actually mean and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.470" end="00:21:38.980" style="s2">first one of them is this word what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:41.620" style="s2">resilience and when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.980" end="00:21:47.049" style="s2">resilience there&#39;s on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.620" end="00:21:49.330" style="s2">capacity of an ecosystem to persist in</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.330" end="00:21:57.040" style="s2">the outside or another way of saying it</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.270" end="00:21:59.049" style="s2">is absorbing or coping with these</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.040" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">disruptions in such a way that the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.049" end="00:22:04.330" style="s2">structure and the function of the system</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:07.000" style="s2">stays the same and then when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.330" end="00:22:09.220" style="s2">disruption becomes too much or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.000" end="00:22:12.220" style="s2">intervals of the disruption becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.220" end="00:22:12.790" style="s2">frequently that the system cannot cope</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.790" end="00:22:19.179" style="s2">then the next level would be adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:22.120" style="s2">capacity which is to change the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.179" end="00:22:24.460" style="s2">structure of the system slightly in</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:22.850" style="s2">explain a little bit more about in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.640" end="00:25:26.510" style="s2">talk is what is called the adaptive</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.510" end="00:25:33.730" style="s2">understand here is that resilience</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.820" end="00:25:38.179" style="s2">theory isn&#39;t just some kind of detached</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.730" end="00:25:40.910" style="s2">academic theory it is the result of 50</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.179" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">years of studying change dynamics within</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:54.909" style="s2">happens in these systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.429" end="00:25:58.149" style="s2">and this adaptive psycho is kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.070" end="00:26:15.639" style="s2">the same image repeated because it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.309" end="00:26:18.729" style="s2">central to what designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.639" end="00:26:22.629" style="s2">cultures is about the capacity to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.729" end="00:26:24.789" style="s2">and transform in response to changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.629" end="00:26:28.210" style="s2">environmental conditions and changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.789" end="00:26:31.089" style="s2">social conditions is what regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.210" end="00:26:34.359" style="s2">cultures need to grow and need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.089" end="00:26:36.909" style="s2">improve on and so let me just talk you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.359" end="00:26:41.289" style="s2">briefly through this adaptive cycle</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:43.809" style="s2">it&#39;s basically best to start at the blue</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.289" end="00:26:46.749" style="s2">arrow which is when the system is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.809" end="00:26:50.349" style="s2">starting to if you if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.749" end="00:26:52.479" style="s2">in terms of a clearing or a forested</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.349" end="00:26:54.899" style="s2">area like the forest areas in California</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.479" end="00:26:58.419" style="s2">that have been leveled by a wildfire</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.899" end="00:27:01.330" style="s2">last summer and then when ecological</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.419" end="00:27:03.690" style="s2">succession starts to happen and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.330" end="00:27:05.859" style="s2">first species come in and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.690" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">succession plants come in and take over</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.859" end="00:27:16.049" style="s2">and eventually you get a series of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:19.239" style="s2">successions that lead to a peak canopy</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.049" end="00:27:21.509" style="s2">peak productivity ecosystems which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.239" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">when when you get into the green arrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.509" end="00:27:28.989" style="s2">where rather than lots of like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:32.289" style="s2">reason why where it says in blue growth</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.989" end="00:27:34.690" style="s2">and the little our that&#39;s our selection</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.289" end="00:27:36.940" style="s2">our selections are species that produce</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.690" end="00:27:38.919" style="s2">lots of seeds and some of them survive</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.940" end="00:27:41.789" style="s2">but most of them don&#39;t and then in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.919" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">in the in the second in the green arrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.789" end="00:27:46.450" style="s2">conservation happens where K selected</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:48.639" style="s2">species are favored which are basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.450" end="00:27:50.469" style="s2">species that produce just a lot a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.639" end="00:27:52.570" style="s2">offspring but care for them a lot which</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.469" end="00:27:56.549" style="s2">is most of the mammals and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.570" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">us and when you in these systems where</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.549" end="00:28:05.260" style="s2">the green arrow gets to the top then the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:07.270" style="s2">amount of free</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.260" end="00:28:09.010" style="s2">Capital is like most capital is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.270" end="00:28:11.590" style="s2">locked-up most nutrients are locked up</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.010" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">in the system and most connections that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.590" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">can be made are already made most</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:18.700" style="s2">relationships are already defined and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:20.860" style="s2">the system becomes rigid and as the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.700" end="00:28:23.650" style="s2">environment changes it might not serve</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.860" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">the new conditions anymore and really</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.650" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">that&#39;s where we are at the moment we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">created a globalized economy that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:32.620" style="s2">quite rigid in the way it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:35.500" style="s2">structures access to capital and access</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.620" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">to resources and it has created an</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.500" end="00:28:40.030" style="s2">enormous Lea brittle system particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">because we&#39;ve divorced ourselves from</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.030" end="00:28:45.940" style="s2">the rest of nature and nature&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:48.309" style="s2">to create abundance for all of life and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.940" end="00:28:51.160" style="s2">so then you move into this breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.309" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">stage where the existing patterns don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.160" end="00:28:57.700" style="s2">serve any longer and we need to release</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:29:00.490" style="s2">structures that don&#39;t serve and move</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.700" end="00:29:03.429" style="s2">into from break down into break through</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.490" end="00:29:06.520" style="s2">move into experimenting rapidly with new</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.429" end="00:29:09.940" style="s2">options and reorganizing the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.520" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">the system to respond to the new</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.940" end="00:29:16.360" style="s2">conditions and so this loop happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:18.669" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in the patch in a forest</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.360" end="00:29:21.850" style="s2">where just a tree fell or where it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.669" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">an entire forest ecosystem in in an area</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.850" end="00:29:26.919" style="s2">in California and it happens at</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:32.350" style="s2">different scales at different time</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.919" end="00:29:34.780" style="s2">scales and so nature is this nested</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.350" end="00:29:38.650" style="s2">system of these dynamic change loops</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.780" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">happening all the time and I focused I</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.650" end="00:29:42.460" style="s2">gave us this idea of a hole a cube and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.730" style="s2">when we work regenitive lee we always</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:47.890" style="s2">have to think of where does what we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.730" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">sit in a relationship to the next larger</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.890" end="00:29:52.900" style="s2">hole where does our community sit in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.410" end="00:29:55.660" style="s2">bio region where does our bio region sit</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.900" end="00:29:58.210" style="s2">within our national patterns of of doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.660" end="00:30:03.040" style="s2">things and where do our nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.210" end="00:30:04.929" style="s2">sit within the global patterns of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.040" end="00:30:07.750" style="s2">creating conditions conducive to life</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.929" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">how do we collaborate between nations to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.750" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">increase planetary bio productivity in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:17.290" style="s2">such a way that we create abundance for</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:18.780" style="s2">all and so as you can see in this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.290" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2">diagram</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.780" end="00:30:25.580" style="s2">these patterns of change that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.240" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">described by the adaptive cycle are also</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.580" end="00:30:32.280" style="s2">nested at the local regional and global</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:34.890" style="s2">scale and sometimes when a system is in</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.280" end="00:30:37.230" style="s2">that breakdown phase the red phase it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.890" end="00:30:40.700" style="s2">can lead to a revolt at the next level</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.230" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">up it can create innovations that then</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">like local innovations can can become</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:48.510" style="s2">innovations at the biosphere the by</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:51.419" style="s2">origin or scale and by a regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.510" end="00:30:53.850" style="s2">innovation can then also affect the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.419" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">national scale so in many ways what</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.850" end="00:31:00.330" style="s2">seems to be the case in ecosystems is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">that innovations are local and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.330" end="00:31:06.450" style="s2">spread into the global and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:09.570" style="s2">lesson for us as we redesign the human</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.450" end="00:31:11.640" style="s2">presence on earth our impact on earth we</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.570" end="00:31:14.549" style="s2">need to start locally and by originally</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.640" end="00:31:16.770" style="s2">and then spread patterns that work</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.549" end="00:31:20.070" style="s2">between bio regions but always with</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.770" end="00:31:25.860" style="s2">sensitivity to the unique conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.070" end="00:31:29.730" style="s2">those bio regions and this is both scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.860" end="00:31:32.909" style="s2">linking work in terms of spatial scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.730" end="00:31:35.789" style="s2">linking but also in terms of temporal</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.909" end="00:31:38.039" style="s2">scale linking because these big patterns</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.789" end="00:31:42.390" style="s2">at the global scale are much slower</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.039" end="00:31:44.429" style="s2">or this patterns at large biomes levels</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.390" end="00:31:47.370" style="s2">like the regional patterns are slower</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.429" end="00:31:51.690" style="s2">again then the change at the regional</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.370" end="00:31:54.780" style="s2">level and so one key lesson to take from</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.690" end="00:31:57.419" style="s2">this is that breakdown is nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.780" end="00:31:59.669" style="s2">we should fear breakdown is part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.419" end="00:32:02.039" style="s2">these change cycles we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.669" end="00:32:03.570" style="s2">breakdown at different scales in order</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:53.800" style="s2">detail right now because I really would</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.850" end="00:33:55.480" style="s2">like to have some questions so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.800" end="00:33:57.520" style="s2">gonna move on I know this is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:33:58.840" style="s2">tour de force with a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.520" end="00:34:03.910" style="s2">technical concepts</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.840" end="00:34:06.040" style="s2">I hope the translators coping and all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.910" end="00:34:09.010" style="s2">this for me is contextualized within</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.040" end="00:34:12.850" style="s2">what I said earlier the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.010" end="00:34:15.129" style="s2">as life capable of creating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.850" end="00:34:16.600" style="s2">conducive to life and if we understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.129" end="00:34:20.020" style="s2">this within the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.600" end="00:34:24.760" style="s2">evolutionist evolutionary story then we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.020" end="00:34:28.540" style="s2">can see that while competitive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.760" end="00:34:31.149" style="s2">does exist in nature it normally within</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.540" end="00:34:33.970" style="s2">within groups selfish competitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.149" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2">behavior sometimes beats altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.970" end="00:34:37.669" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:40.190" style="s2">if you have a group where too much</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.669" end="00:34:42.020" style="s2">competitive behavior happens then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.190" end="00:34:44.899" style="s2">doesn&#39;t compete very well with other</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.020" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">groups so this is called multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.899" end="00:34:49.780" style="s2">selection so basically groups which can</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:52.369" style="s2">collaborate and be altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.780" end="00:34:55.549" style="s2">out-compete groups that are full of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.369" end="00:34:58.220" style="s2">competitive individuals and so we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.549" end="00:35:00.250" style="s2">to understand that as life has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.220" end="00:35:04.119" style="s2">it has evolved through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.250" end="00:35:06.559" style="s2">diversification and then subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.119" end="00:35:10.690" style="s2">reintegration of that diversity at</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.559" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">higher levels of complexity and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.690" end="00:35:16.790" style="s2">reintegration happens more often than</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:20.450" style="s2">not through collaborative processes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.790" end="00:35:24.349" style="s2">we are now faced in this multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.450" end="00:35:27.140" style="s2">selection kind of way with global crises</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.349" end="00:35:31.069" style="s2">coming at us as one species where the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.140" end="00:35:33.470" style="s2">only way we can respond viably in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.069" end="00:35:37.940" style="s2">that we will have a future as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.470" end="00:35:39.950" style="s2">is to make that shift from thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.650" style="s2">it&#39;s all about competitive advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.950" end="00:35:46.660" style="s2">that shift towards collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.650" end="00:35:49.970" style="s2">advantage and learning from how</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.660" end="00:35:53.710" style="s2">ecosystems do this all the time is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.970" end="00:35:59.809" style="s2">I call systems level bio-inspired</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.710" end="00:36:03.829" style="s2">innovation and design and so just lastly</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.809" end="00:36:07.730" style="s2">we we are really at what I would call a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.829" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">species level rite of passage we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.730" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">been an immature young species taking</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:23.290" style="s2">large been a degenerative presence on</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.290" end="00:36:28.549" style="s2">era the Anthropocene because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.390" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">become a geological force I would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.549" end="00:36:35.510" style="s2">to call it the eco zoic the the era</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.609" style="s2">where we finally understand that we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.510" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">to reintegrate ourselves into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.609" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">ecosystem and Otto Sharma and others</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:45.950" style="s2">have worked with this shift from ego to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:47.990" style="s2">eco and I quite like this illustration</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.930" end="00:40:14.320" style="s2">design what we design and i must say i</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.890" end="00:40:16.270" style="s2">personally haven&#39;t done so much work</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.320" end="00:40:18.970" style="s2">with high school students of mainly work</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.270" end="00:40:22.510" style="s2">with university students but a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.970" end="00:40:25.150" style="s2">mine in norway has set up a institute</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.510" end="00:40:28.119" style="s2">called the small earth institute and she</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.150" end="00:40:30.310" style="s2">is looking at exactly that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.119" end="00:40:32.470" style="s2">work with high school students on</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.310" end="00:40:36.099" style="s2">regenerative cultures and i think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.470" end="00:40:38.680" style="s2">already listed a lot of resources on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.099" end="00:40:41.050" style="s2">website and so if you google small earth</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.680" end="00:40:45.580" style="s2">institute norway you will probably find</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.050" end="00:40:48.900" style="s2">some inspiration but if i had to answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.580" end="00:40:54.339" style="s2">the questions respond taneous lee for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.900" end="00:40:56.050" style="s2">so much is about educating kids about a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.339" end="00:40:58.780" style="s2">connection to the natural environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.050" end="00:41:02.859" style="s2">and taking them out of the classroom and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.780" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">and letting them experience and vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.859" end="00:41:08.530" style="s2">ecosystems as much as possible and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:10.150" style="s2">work with natural environments and i</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.530" end="00:41:12.310" style="s2">know that&#39;s not always possible in city</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.150" end="00:41:15.250" style="s2">environments but bringing some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.310" end="00:41:17.660" style="s2">nature into the classroom working with</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.250" end="00:41:19.369" style="s2">even if it&#39;s just in the courtyard a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.660" end="00:41:20.740" style="s2">little bit of container based gardening</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.369" end="00:41:23.660" style="s2">and a little bit of permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.740" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">bringing plants into the classroom and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.660" end="00:41:30.820" style="s2">involving the students into maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:33.830" style="s2">and caring for them all of that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.820" end="00:41:35.710" style="s2">abstract really key lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.830" end="00:41:38.630" style="s2">biomimicry and also regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.710" end="00:41:43.420" style="s2">based on that but that&#39;s just just a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.630" end="00:41:48.099" style="s2">starting point okay amazing thank you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.420" end="00:41:51.290" style="s2">and then we have a long question here</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.099" end="00:41:53.780" style="s2">which is we are working in Brazil with</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.290" end="00:41:55.960" style="s2">some huge communities who are dealing</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.780" end="00:41:59.150" style="s2">not only with traditional and innovative</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.960" end="00:42:01.339" style="s2">knowledge but which are developing new</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.150" end="00:42:03.470" style="s2">ways of living in communities supporting</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.339" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">themselves creating alternative</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.470" end="00:42:10.250" style="s2">technologies which we think could</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:12.290" style="s2">contribute to a kind of a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.250" end="00:42:14.680" style="s2">culture not only for those communities</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.290" end="00:42:17.270" style="s2">but also for many other social sectors</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:19.369" style="s2">what do you ever heard about them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.270" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">beyond this are we able to interconnect</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.369" end="00:42:25.190" style="s2">many of this and other communitarian</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">initiatives all over the world so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.190" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">reckon he&#39;s talking about eco villages</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:39.170" style="s2">or yeah Cristina - no communities so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:40.910" style="s2">have spent a lot of my well the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.170" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">15 years with the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.910" end="00:42:45.320" style="s2">Network movement and I&#39;ve lived in</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:48.619" style="s2">Finland on eco villages in the finto and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.320" end="00:42:50.540" style="s2">eco village for four years and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.619" end="00:42:55.250" style="s2">excited like the last time I was in</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.540" end="00:42:57.800" style="s2">Brazil was at Rio mas bench in the UN</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.250" end="00:43:00.380" style="s2">summit on sustainable development and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.800" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">met a lot of the people in Casa the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.380" end="00:43:05.720" style="s2">Latin American network of eco villages</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:08.330" style="s2">and I think these intentional</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.720" end="00:43:10.580" style="s2">communities working in place working</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.330" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">with indigenous communities in many</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.580" end="00:43:17.180" style="s2">cases in South America a key innovation</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:19.310" style="s2">places where we can learn a lot and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.180" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">key bit about my book&#39;s title is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.310" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:26.390" style="s2">plural we need to match them to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">unique conditions of place and culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.390" end="00:43:30.930" style="s2">and so we need more of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:34.830" style="s2">experiments and we also need to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.930" end="00:43:37.620" style="s2">ways of how to infiltrate mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.830" end="00:43:40.320" style="s2">communities in sub urban and urban</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.620" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">environments and sometimes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.320" end="00:43:45.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a benefit from working on</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">small-scale eco village intentional</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:50.130" style="s2">community because it allows like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:52.920" style="s2">have more buy-in you have a group that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:55.080" style="s2">wants to live differently so it allows</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.920" end="00:43:57.330" style="s2">for much more rapid iterations in your</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.080" end="00:44:00.780" style="s2">innovation innovation cycle and learning</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.330" end="00:44:04.530" style="s2">but it tends to always be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.780" end="00:44:06.750" style="s2">removed from the majority world from how</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.530" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">most people that are still running in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.750" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">some kind of treadmill are living so</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:14.190" style="s2">while we need these experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:16.530" style="s2">they&#39;re really important and I think gen</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.190" end="00:44:19.320" style="s2">and casa a good networks to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.530" end="00:44:22.440" style="s2">interconnecting them um in terms of more</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.320" end="00:44:23.940" style="s2">the technological innovation side the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.440" end="00:44:26.850" style="s2">peer-to-peer network is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.940" end="00:44:30.090" style="s2">platform to bring them together and yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.850" end="00:44:33.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about local innovation in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.090" end="00:44:36.360" style="s2">global collaboration and exchange let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.210" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">have more of it great and there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.360" end="00:44:41.670" style="s2">quite a few questions here about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:44.760" style="s2">business and commerce and regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.670" end="00:44:48.060" style="s2">so maybe I read a couple of them and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.760" end="00:44:50.490" style="s2">maybe you can give a an answer so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.060" end="00:44:53.640" style="s2">first is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.490" end="00:44:56.610" style="s2">what could a sever economic system look</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.640" end="00:44:58.770" style="s2">like and then another question is</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.610" end="00:45:01.050" style="s2">whether there are companies applying the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.770" end="00:45:04.410" style="s2">concept of regenerative design within</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.050" end="00:45:05.850" style="s2">highly competitive systems and then what</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.410" end="00:45:08.220" style="s2">are some of the challenges of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.850" end="00:45:11.640" style="s2">implementing that kind of change at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.220" end="00:45:13.110" style="s2">executive level so a little bit a dream</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.640" end="00:45:15.180" style="s2">question about what could the severe</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.110" end="00:45:18.420" style="s2">economic system look like and what are</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.180" end="00:45:21.300" style="s2">some examples are some some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.420" end="00:45:24.840" style="s2">challenges of implementing this okay so</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.300" end="00:45:29.130" style="s2">in terms of the like I I&#39;m actually part</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.840" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">of a global research project at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.130" end="00:45:32.790" style="s2">moment that is looking into what</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.750" end="00:45:37.290" style="s2">regenerative economies might look like</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.790" end="00:45:39.990" style="s2">and in many ways this question what will</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.290" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">the saver a service focused economy look</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.990" end="00:45:43.669" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:49.029" style="s2">is very akin to that and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.669" end="00:45:51.859" style="s2">beginning to get towards is if</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.029" end="00:45:54.409" style="s2">ultimately over the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.859" end="00:45:56.359" style="s2">life has created conditions conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.409" end="00:45:58.759" style="s2">life by increasing the amount of bio</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.359" end="00:46:00.589" style="s2">productivity in the planet and basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.759" end="00:46:03.650" style="s2">making the planet more inhabitable</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.589" end="00:46:05.689" style="s2">making it lusher more abundant storing</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.650" end="00:46:08.749" style="s2">up generation over generation and over</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.689" end="00:46:12.559" style="s2">generation a wealth of biodiversity and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.749" end="00:46:17.209" style="s2">and energetic and material abundance</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.559" end="00:46:20.179" style="s2">that that life thrives off then we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.209" end="00:46:21.439" style="s2">say that while the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.179" end="00:46:24.349" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.439" end="00:46:27.079" style="s2">the march towards entropy still holds in</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.349" end="00:46:30.439" style="s2">the large timescale of universal time</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.079" end="00:46:33.559" style="s2">patterns on the timescale of our planet</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.559" end="00:46:38.689" style="s2">nothing in terms of universal time</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:42.289" style="s2">patterns life is actually a sin tropic</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.689" end="00:46:45.159" style="s2">force life pushes the end march towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.289" end="00:46:47.569" style="s2">entropy in the other direction and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.159" end="00:46:50.419" style="s2">I&#39;m answering with a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.569" end="00:46:52.489" style="s2">question again a saver economy is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.419" end="00:46:54.679" style="s2">economy that is a sin tropic economy</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.489" end="00:46:58.659" style="s2">that creates conditions conducive to</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.559" end="00:47:14.479" style="s2">relatively abstract and I think just as</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.469" end="00:47:16.219" style="s2">with the question what would a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.479" end="00:47:19.489" style="s2">regenerative economy or regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.219" end="00:47:22.339" style="s2">economies look like we are we have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.489" end="00:47:25.279" style="s2">we have models we have case studies that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.339" end="00:47:29.229" style="s2">are definitely giving us hope that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.279" end="00:47:32.599" style="s2">can do this but we in the middle of a of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.229" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">living the questions together I am don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.599" end="00:47:37.969" style="s2">expect answers in and be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:39.499" style="s2">suspicious of anybody who will say yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.969" end="00:47:41.089" style="s2">sure I&#39;ll give you the answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.499" end="00:47:44.089" style="s2">kind of question and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.089" end="00:47:47.390" style="s2">coming to the corporate questions and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.089" end="00:47:50.419" style="s2">have big questions about how some large</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.390" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">companies can be transformed and I had</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.419" end="00:47:54.289" style="s2">the pleasure of working whether with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:54.860" style="s2">unique large company that is still</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.289" end="00:47:58.460" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.860" end="00:48:01.370" style="s2">and therefore not having to bow to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.460" end="00:48:04.250" style="s2">pressure of profit maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.370" end="00:48:07.640" style="s2">shareholders but most of the large</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.250" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">corporations that that can&#39;t even decide</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.640" end="00:48:12.230" style="s2">for themselves how they make the shift</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:14.020" style="s2">from being degenerative monsters</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.230" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">destroying the planet to being</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.020" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">regenerative participants m.d</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:22.130" style="s2">centralizing production and consumption</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.770" end="00:48:25.610" style="s2">in such a way that they become knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.130" end="00:48:27.350" style="s2">holders for regenerative networks they</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.610" end="00:48:29.360" style="s2">might not be able to do this because in</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.350" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">the short term it might be less</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.360" end="00:48:36.560" style="s2">profitable then it then following a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:39.350" style="s2">different path but their reality is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.560" end="00:48:41.150" style="s2">only less profitable or it seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.350" end="00:48:45.250" style="s2">seemingly more profitable because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.150" end="00:48:48.290" style="s2">tend to externalize all the impacts and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.250" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">socialize all the costs that that these</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.290" end="00:48:53.930" style="s2">impacts have so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:55.640" style="s2">journey and I think it will take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.930" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">of soul-searching for large corporations</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:01.580" style="s2">and I pull my hat to anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.510" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">trying to work with one of these large</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.580" end="00:49:07.400" style="s2">corporations in in a regenerative way</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:10.280" style="s2">I&#39;m open to joining the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.400" end="00:49:12.560" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have answers I just have</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.280" end="00:49:16.930" style="s2">ideas I have a lot of questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.560" end="00:49:20.510" style="s2">need to ask to do that thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:23.840" style="s2">maybe just to ask a fragment of one</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.510" end="00:49:26.330" style="s2">question that was asked here so knowing</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.840" end="00:49:28.570" style="s2">that it&#39;s this big challenge in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.330" end="00:49:31.340" style="s2">change the world view and the mindset</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.570" end="00:49:33.500" style="s2">from the people in charge in these</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.340" end="00:49:35.750" style="s2">corporations which do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.500" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">gonna happen sooner do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.750" end="00:49:45.170" style="s2">these companies will end up dying or you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:49.220" style="s2">know going through a cycle of breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.170" end="00:49:51.820" style="s2">or do you think the planet will you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.220" end="00:49:57.100" style="s2">succumb or humanity will succumb first</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.820" end="00:50:00.080" style="s2">well I think we we definitely have one</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.100" end="00:50:01.640" style="s2">glimmer of hope that it this is none of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.080" end="00:50:06.020" style="s2">this is about trying to save the planet</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.640" end="00:50:08.670" style="s2">and Gaia will be absolutely fine without</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.020" end="00:50:11.400" style="s2">us one could even be facetious</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.670" end="00:50:14.460" style="s2">well maybe she would be a lot better if</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.400" end="00:50:16.680" style="s2">we just exit it faster it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.460" end="00:50:18.690" style="s2">unfortunately like that unless we change</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.680" end="00:50:21.930" style="s2">our behavior but we have the potential</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.690" end="00:50:24.660" style="s2">of becoming healing and stewarding</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.930" end="00:50:28.220" style="s2">elements within gaia once we understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.660" end="00:50:34.260" style="s2">that we are gaia and so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.220" end="00:50:37.589" style="s2">these large corporations well we might</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.260" end="00:50:39.750" style="s2">see human civilization as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.589" end="00:50:43.349" style="s2">collapse before some of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.750" end="00:50:45.660" style="s2">corporations were change um and if</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.349" end="00:50:49.260" style="s2">anybody&#39;s not watched djembe and Elle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.660" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">video on deep adaptation please google</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.260" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s worth watching because he</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:57.930" style="s2">spells out that we are facing imminent</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:51:00.780" style="s2">near-term human extinction if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.930" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">change our ways and we have left the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.780" end="00:51:06.030" style="s2">window of opportunity so small that even</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">if we start changing our ways we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.030" end="00:51:10.440" style="s2">have guarantees anymore that we will</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:12.750" style="s2">make it we will have to find it within</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.440" end="00:51:16.049" style="s2">us and that&#39;s the species-level rite of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.750" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">passage we have to act even if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.049" end="00:51:20.730" style="s2">know whether the outcomes is going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:23.099" style="s2">save us and that very action from that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.730" end="00:51:25.290" style="s2">place in service of life and future</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.099" end="00:51:27.809" style="s2">generations is the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.290" end="00:51:29.420" style="s2">process and I&#39;m not sure how many large</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.809" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">corporations are willing to make that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.420" end="00:51:36.150" style="s2">shift but as I hinted at before my guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:38.069" style="s2">is that if you want to just as when the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.150" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">dinosaurs were still around and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.069" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">were little shrew like little mammals</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.470" style="s2">running between their feet and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:49.980" style="s2">dinosaurs were the megafauna</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.470" end="00:51:52.020" style="s2">and well we have agile small bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.980" end="00:51:55.020" style="s2">companies who are already acting</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.020" end="00:51:56.910" style="s2">regenerative ly between the feats of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.020" end="00:51:58.859" style="s2">dinosaurs of large multinational</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.910" end="00:52:01.079" style="s2">corporations at the moment but I also</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.859" end="00:52:03.329" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say that there isn&#39;t a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.079" end="00:52:05.309" style="s2">of wealth in the people in the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.329" end="00:52:07.530" style="s2">in the tradition of these large</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.309" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">corporations and that I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.530" end="00:52:14.940" style="s2">bedevil them in any way um but my sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:16.859" style="s2">is that for them to be relevant in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.940" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">second half of this century or even</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.859" end="00:52:21.730" style="s2">within the next 10-15 years they need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:24.430" style="s2">start to look at how</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.730" end="00:52:28.170" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing their whole supply</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.430" end="00:52:32.140" style="s2">webs on to a much more RiRi generalizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.170" end="00:52:34.119" style="s2">level they can become global networks of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.140" end="00:52:37.000" style="s2">knowledge holders but they need to free</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.119" end="00:52:39.160" style="s2">all the patents and move towards an</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.000" end="00:52:41.260" style="s2">open-source innovation pattern because</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.160" end="00:52:43.480" style="s2">this is ultimately not about what</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.260" end="00:52:46.119" style="s2">company succeeds anymore it&#39;s about what</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.480" end="00:52:49.869" style="s2">the humanity finds a future in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.119" end="00:52:52.750" style="s2">community of life or whether we go</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.869" end="00:52:55.270" style="s2">extinct and in the process erodes so</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.750" end="00:52:59.710" style="s2">much of life&#39;s inheritance of the last</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.270" end="00:53:01.570" style="s2">3.8 million years so watch this space</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.710" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">that the jury&#39;s still out</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.570" end="00:53:08.140" style="s2">and as I&#39;ve just recently seen an</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:10.660" style="s2">article that I wrote in 2004 where I</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.140" end="00:53:12.520" style="s2">quote Donella Meadows saying that when</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.660" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">people ask her do we still have enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.520" end="00:53:18.040" style="s2">time she always says the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:22.630" style="s2">just have enough time if we start today</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.040" end="00:53:26.350" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s it we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.630" end="00:53:28.090" style="s2">do all do our best to see whether we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.350" end="00:53:28.600" style="s2">turn this oil tanker around before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.090" end="00:53:32.920" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.600" end="00:53:36.190" style="s2">and I think maybe a common thread</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.920" end="00:53:39.220" style="s2">amongst three or four questions here is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.190" end="00:53:43.420" style="s2">about the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.220" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">so both as in what are some references</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.420" end="00:53:49.750" style="s2">or case studies or examples of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:51.790" style="s2">scale linked regeneration where you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.750" end="00:53:55.270" style="s2">a local initiative for regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.790" end="00:53:59.410" style="s2">actually had systemic impacts and could</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.270" end="00:54:02.530" style="s2">be could be scaled and and another is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.410" end="00:54:06.510" style="s2">also how how do we build the evidence so</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.530" end="00:54:10.630" style="s2">people who will be so like from you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.510" end="00:54:13.660" style="s2">economists to politicians to people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.630" end="00:54:15.760" style="s2">are sitting on the board in in large</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.660" end="00:54:18.970" style="s2">corporations like how do we build the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.760" end="00:54:23.260" style="s2">evidence where is the evidence like how</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.970" end="00:54:27.609" style="s2">do we build a business case I take a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.260" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">little like I know that we love looking</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.609" end="00:54:32.350" style="s2">at performance indicators and evidence I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:34.809" style="s2">mean there there&#39;s a lot of evidence but</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.350" end="00:54:38.109" style="s2">it is anecdotal it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.809" end="00:54:39.579" style="s2">specific storytelling evidence it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.109" end="00:54:41.470" style="s2">like you&#39;ve seen the pictures of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.579" end="00:54:44.190" style="s2">Loess Plateau there are other places in</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.470" end="00:54:46.599" style="s2">Ethiopia in Senegal where similar</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.190" end="00:54:48.460" style="s2">large-scale ecosystems restoration is</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.599" end="00:54:51.069" style="s2">happening a lot of eco villages have</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.460" end="00:54:53.049" style="s2">been involved in ecosystems restoration</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.069" end="00:54:55.420" style="s2">for a long long time and they can</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.049" end="00:54:57.039" style="s2">demonstrate that the the springs start</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.420" end="00:55:00.069" style="s2">flowing again and that the the water</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.039" end="00:55:02.619" style="s2">comes back and there are companies who</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.069" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">can demonstrate that they&#39;ve improved</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.619" end="00:55:08.980" style="s2">the social cohesion in their communities</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">and and increased the positive effects</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.980" end="00:55:13.779" style="s2">on the environment and but I think we</p>
