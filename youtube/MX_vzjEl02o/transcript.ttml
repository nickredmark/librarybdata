<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">I guess both of us would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">described as IDW adjacent would you like</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:16.590" style="s2">to I just like if you could just talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:19.130" style="s2">about your your own background for a for</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.590" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">a bit what&#39;s your bio oh sure I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.130" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">used to just say documentary filmmaker</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:24.630" style="s2">cuz that seemed to mean something in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">world I&#39;m not sure what it means but</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.630" end="00:00:27.529" style="s2">that you know I come from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">independent documentary filmmaking world</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.529" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">went to school for for film started I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">guess asking more let&#39;s call it I DW ish</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">political questions in college when 9/11</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">hit when I was a sophomore and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">really started a lot of the gears in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">mind moving in the direction of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">where certain questions have have come</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.860" style="s2">out and finally a couple years ago just</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">Dovan after sort of frustration was</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.860" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">boiling over and reached out to a group</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">that was hosting Sam Harrison Maajid</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">Nawaz and Australia the things moved</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:00.539" style="s2">pretty quickly and suddenly we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">making a documentary based on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.539" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">collaboration between Majid and Sam and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:08.310" style="s2">and I guess that alerted you know my</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">presence to some some IDW folks and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.310" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">whatever this word means is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">sure we&#39;ll talk about it I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">the word now I guess when people ask me</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">what I do and I say content creator it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">sounds really thin but I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">what it is I&#39;m a content creator in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">philosophical and intellectual space so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">that&#39;s podcasts and documentary that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">few of us around</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">yeah whatever we are you know anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">that moves and makes noise and has</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">pictures we kind of touch and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">hopefully try to do some good with it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re in the same boat there but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">guess we&#39;re pointing our cameras at some</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">some ideas that would be considered IDW</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">so that makes us literally adjacent to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">it in many cases yeah yeah Jason enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">to be able to say it in film it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">put it that way yeah and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">adjacent enough that hopefully people</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">like us do our homework a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">which means you&#39;re gonna have to expose</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:57.540" style="s2">yourself to these ideas and and see the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">what&#39;s good about them what&#39;s bad about</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.540" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">them try to poke around at the dangers</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">hopefully take sort of a critical eye to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">some of the ideas because presumably we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">we care about them and in some in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">way do you have a definition for the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">or for the wider I mean I sort of look</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:17.099" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">as the IDW is the named part of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.099" end="00:02:22.290" style="s2">broader movement and and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:23.849" style="s2">maybe you have to disentangle those</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.290" end="00:02:26.549" style="s2">things as well to see what is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.849" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">emergent phenomenon that the IDW is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.549" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">sort of named part of yeah I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.359" style="s2">know actually and then this is why it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:37.109" style="s2">becomes so hard to talk about when the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.359" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">definition is so you know loose to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.109" end="00:02:41.209" style="s2">with I have what I wish it would be I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:44.969" style="s2">think even burying that initial article</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.209" end="00:02:48.329" style="s2">sort of pondered what I want it to be is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.969" end="00:02:51.650" style="s2">this what I want it to be is people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.329" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">are connected by their common pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.650" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">truth and unafraid to ask taboo or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:01.169" style="s2">call it politically uncorrect questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:02.609" style="s2">to find that truth that could be you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.169" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">know it&#39;s people who are unafraid to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.609" end="00:03:07.169" style="s2">wander into the waters of IQ and race or</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:09.689" style="s2">religion and violence and you know these</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.169" end="00:03:11.909" style="s2">things that sort of make people cringe</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.689" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">you know everyone says famously when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.909" end="00:03:15.659" style="s2">get at the dinner table don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">politics or religion this is a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.659" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">people who are like we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:19.349" style="s2">about politics and religion because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">matters and we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.349" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">somewhere but that pursuit if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">pursuit of truth in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:27.359" style="s2">abstract way that&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:29.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve written about but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.359" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">philosophical pursuit trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.430" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">truth and where I think it can there the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">cracks that are showing in the IDW that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">I worry about is if it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:41.009" style="s2">political movement i define them very</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:42.629" style="s2">distinctly that philosophical effort is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.009" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">one where you&#39;re seeking to find truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.629" end="00:03:47.639" style="s2">again just sort of agnostic lis just</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:49.259" style="s2">truth for its own sake and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.639" end="00:03:52.079" style="s2">political movement is trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.259" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">out how to be effective which is which</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.079" end="00:03:55.979" style="s2">is agnostic of truth you could be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">worst person in the world like Pol Pot</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.979" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">you know that regime was very political</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">I obviously disagree with their</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">philosophical precepts but they figured</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:04.229" style="s2">they were figuring out how to move</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">people from point A to point B and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.229" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">could do it with progressive movements</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.439" style="s2">or any movement and if the IDW becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">you know the difference between being a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.439" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">journalist and an activist is a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">interesting conversation and if it if it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">becomes politicians rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">philosophers in that mindset then then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:24.779" style="s2">think it&#39;s rightful to attack it and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:26.250" style="s2">think the cracks will probably crumble</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.779" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">it in some ways you sort of pretend like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.250" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">no one&#39;s listening</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:29.610" style="s2">pretend like you&#39;re not going to get in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">trouble for the questions you asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:33.960" style="s2">there we see that that that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">naive which is why it inherently has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.960" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">become a little political because people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.430" end="00:04:39.930" style="s2">are watching and so your words matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">and there is no matter how philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.930" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">you want to be there is always a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:46.650" style="s2">a a risk to saying things publicly even</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">anything I say here I assume it will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.650" end="00:04:53.699" style="s2">seen and so having just a let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:55.380" style="s2">a moral filter on what you say is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.699" end="00:04:58.199" style="s2">probably a good thing for all of us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.380" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">ponder but I think the IDW if it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.199" end="00:05:02.970" style="s2">anything was a recognition that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">filter had gotten so thick that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.970" end="00:05:06.389" style="s2">were just self censoring themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:08.190" style="s2">these extreme ways and it really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.389" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">mattered particularly the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.190" end="00:05:12.300" style="s2">acceleration of it after 9/11 where</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">where I jumped into it with the film I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.300" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">made was I think noticing that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">filter was so thick that it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:20.430" style="s2">doing real real damage and we could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:21.870" style="s2">headed and maybe we are now you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.430" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">with the Trump moment we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.870" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">about maybe we we have wandered into</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:27.389" style="s2">those waters where the filter actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">was counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.389" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">so hopefully the IDW is dissolving the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:35.880" style="s2">filter and you know seeing what we find</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">but I worry that it&#39;s failing to live up</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.880" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">to that potential and a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">circles a mutual friend of ours</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">Ryan Bennett I think came up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:47.639" style="s2">something I think really really useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">called the IDW protocol and I might and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.639" end="00:05:52.409" style="s2">I might flash that up on screen he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">it pinned to his Twitter bio but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.409" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">three principles that I think are as</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:06:00.419" style="s2">good as anything as to defining what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:03.570" style="s2">IDW protocol as a kind of method of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.419" end="00:06:05.430" style="s2">interacting rather than a Content it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.570" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">brilliantly what do you what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.430" end="00:06:11.220" style="s2">of that if I could pick up some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">like platform and incentive things</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.220" end="00:06:13.830" style="s2">because it&#39;s interesting I didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">through the newsroom like you did I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.830" end="00:06:19.229" style="s2">always sort of in the independent world</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">and in my world it was I would see I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.229" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">think the kinds of things that you saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">daily only at the end of my process</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">usually at the end of my process like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:27.930" style="s2">would make a whole film and sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">on an island maybe I would have some</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:30.840" style="s2">investors who really just believed in</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:33.180" style="s2">what I was doing or the story was sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:34.949" style="s2">of you know angel money and in the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.180" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking to distributors and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.949" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">where you&#39;re gonna show this thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:39.659" style="s2">that&#39;s when suddenly all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">incentives I was like oh wait like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.659" end="00:06:42.690" style="s2">need commercials and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:44.580" style="s2">this needs to be a certain length and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.690" end="00:06:47.160" style="s2">all those other factors that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">you were running into in the newsroom</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.160" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like the incentives here you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:51.510" style="s2">30 seconds for a soundbite and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:55.530" style="s2">better make it good all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.510" end="00:06:56.910" style="s2">stuff and yeah and so I I was exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.530" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">it at a very different part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.910" end="00:07:02.460" style="s2">pipeline then you were in in our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:04.530" style="s2">media upbringing but I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.460" end="00:07:07.620" style="s2">really important point maybe to linger</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.530" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">on about the dangers I know this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.620" end="00:07:13.260" style="s2">something we&#39;ll wait into more but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:14.580" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the innocent sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.260" end="00:07:16.020" style="s2">of start of like I just want to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.580" end="00:07:17.610" style="s2">different conversations and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.020" end="00:07:19.230" style="s2">dissatisfied with what I&#39;m seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.610" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">sort of the mainstream or my friends are</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.230" end="00:07:22.860" style="s2">talking about and kind of afraid to talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:25.410" style="s2">about that&#39;s not it&#39;s like a great like</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.860" end="00:07:26.760" style="s2">innocent little kind of thing but you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.410" end="00:07:28.680" style="s2">know you start to pick up steam and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.760" end="00:07:29.970" style="s2">pretty soon you have people watching and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.680" end="00:07:31.350" style="s2">then pretty soon there&#39;s people with</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.970" end="00:07:33.240" style="s2">money and then pretty soon there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.350" end="00:07:35.760" style="s2">commercials and pretty soon it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.240" end="00:07:36.900" style="s2">there&#39;s this habit and humanity of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.760" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">want to like reinvent the wheel every</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.900" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">time but we always keep just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:44.130" style="s2">like rebuilding the same thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">oh that we tore down and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.130" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">in the IDW maybe someone like Rogan that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:50.030" style="s2">you mentioned or all the other names</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:52.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m sure will get into eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.030" end="00:07:55.050" style="s2">start to feel the pressure of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.980" end="00:07:56.790" style="s2">incentives that we feel like we got away</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.050" end="00:08:00.330" style="s2">from and some people have been really</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.790" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">successful about about they&#39;re lucky I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:03.420" style="s2">think but about getting away from those</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2">incentives of like we&#39;re not gonna be ad</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.420" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">based and maybe models like just user</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:11.040" style="s2">patreon kind of stuff is a way to break</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:13.530" style="s2">out of that model maybe it is we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.040" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">trying to sort of figure it out but this</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.530" end="00:08:20.490" style="s2">I think you&#39;re hinting at sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:23.430" style="s2">phenomenon of audience capture of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.490" end="00:08:25.350" style="s2">the feedback loop certainly of financial</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.430" end="00:08:27.300" style="s2">gain when you do something and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.350" end="00:08:28.920" style="s2">your wallet grows and then you just</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.300" end="00:08:31.290" style="s2">start to tend to do that thing again and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.920" end="00:08:35.070" style="s2">wherever the psychology comes into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.290" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">process of sort of you know knowingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.070" end="00:08:38.760" style="s2">well I&#39;m going to repeat the process or</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:40.410" style="s2">you just start feeling good because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.760" end="00:08:41.700" style="s2">your wallet and then the story emerges</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.410" end="00:08:44.220" style="s2">in your mind and you&#39;re doing some post</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.700" end="00:08:46.650" style="s2">hoc rationalization that&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.220" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">stuff I mean we obviously we&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.650" end="00:08:51.210" style="s2">all the news media that the channels</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:53.290" style="s2">seemed to split further more extreme and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.210" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">more you know further left and further</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">and it incentivizes if the mandate is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:01.779" style="s2">just get viewers get clicks we know sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">of where that could lead it&#39;ll amplify</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.779" end="00:09:05.380" style="s2">maybe the darkest parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:07.769" style="s2">psychology that get addicted to outrage</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.380" end="00:09:10.630" style="s2">and all this kind of stuff that we see I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.769" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">think it would be really naive to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.630" end="00:09:16.990" style="s2">pretend that starting a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:18.579" style="s2">with the intention of not of escaping</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.990" end="00:09:20.290" style="s2">all that means you will have</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.579" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">successfully escaped it it will chase</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.290" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">you and it will find you and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:27.670" style="s2">it&#39;s real it&#39;s real potent dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">stuff and I think we should have a level</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.670" end="00:09:33.639" style="s2">of not apologetics for someone who falls</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:35.889" style="s2">in prey to it but sympathy for them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.639" end="00:09:38.290" style="s2">I&#39;m sure we can name names of the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.889" end="00:09:40.149" style="s2">who may have fallen prey to that but we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">should also admit that that that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.149" end="00:09:44.680" style="s2">is like old old psychology that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:46.839" style="s2">deals us on a personal day-to-day level</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.680" end="00:09:49.300" style="s2">of sort of the ends justify the means</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.839" end="00:09:51.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I worked all day at</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.300" end="00:09:53.199" style="s2">Auschwitz but I got paid you know like</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.130" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the extreme version of it but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.199" end="00:09:56.620" style="s2">go to your job and you do your thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:59.709" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re participating in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.620" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">of system that that you know has some</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.709" end="00:10:05.860" style="s2">moral cost to it but in the end the ends</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:07.750" style="s2">justify the means and I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.860" end="00:10:09.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a dangerous it&#39;s a dangerous way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.750" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">live again it&#39;s nothing new it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.550" end="00:10:13.990" style="s2">happens in every sort of field that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:15.880" style="s2">see in sort of an open capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.990" end="00:10:18.990" style="s2">society that we always have to contend</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.880" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">with because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.990" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">attractive it&#39;s attractive even just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:23.889" style="s2">getting the likes even if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:25.209" style="s2">making any money and in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.889" end="00:10:27.370" style="s2">conversation but you get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.209" end="00:10:28.810" style="s2">retweets and likes I think we all check</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.370" end="00:10:30.519" style="s2">our notifications and we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.810" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">admit the dopamine hit that we see when</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.519" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">we see a high number is is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:38.709" style="s2">that we have to contend with yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:42.189" style="s2">I certainly feel that myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.709" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">like like I just just the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.189" end="00:10:46.089" style="s2">there is a comment thread and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">what the audience like and what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.089" end="00:10:50.380" style="s2">don&#39;t like you can I mean if you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:53.589" style="s2">have to not be human to not to not feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.380" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">that in some way yeah yeah yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.589" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">it too and I think we should be honest</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.639" style="s2">about that and be able to laugh at it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:02.380" style="s2">little bit and I think to sort of zoom</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.639" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">out a little bit of you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.380" end="00:11:05.160" style="s2">have talked a lot before and I keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">coming back to this line</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.160" end="00:11:13.110" style="s2">of the danger the dangers that lurk in</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">something like the IDW conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:18.690" style="s2">even followers and fans of it is you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:22.009" style="s2">know once this mistake that I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.690" end="00:11:24.689" style="s2">to notice or basically profess is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.009" end="00:11:26.850" style="s2">there seems to be a trend of people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.689" end="00:11:29.459" style="s2">think the moment that they have rejected</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.850" end="00:11:30.930" style="s2">bad philosophy or a bad philosophy it</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.459" end="00:11:33.000" style="s2">also means they&#39;ve rejected bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:35.160" style="s2">psychology and they really have nothing</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.160" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">find this maybe in a way like I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.079" end="00:11:41.009" style="s2">through like an atheist conversation and</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:54.120" style="s2">really dumb bad idea and you could get</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.379" end="00:11:57.180" style="s2">deep into that but it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.120" end="00:11:59.220" style="s2">you&#39;re not susceptible to the Lords of</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">being like oh I&#39;ve noticed that the left</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.709" end="00:12:09.810" style="s2">is really wacky and it&#39;s gone overboard</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:11.579" style="s2">and look like I&#39;m I woke to this in sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.810" end="00:12:13.079" style="s2">of the red pill way or either side of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.579" end="00:12:15.300" style="s2">that if whether whatever your political</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.079" end="00:12:17.670" style="s2">epiphany is that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.300" end="00:12:21.149" style="s2">escaped the normal trappings that we all</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.670" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">deal with of weak psychology and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.149" end="00:12:25.170" style="s2">they relate but they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:27.360" style="s2">they don&#39;t correlate the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.170" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">think a lot of people tend to to jump</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.360" end="00:12:30.870" style="s2">the gun and think they have and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:32.490" style="s2">goes for the personalities in the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.870" end="00:12:33.899" style="s2">that goes for the big names that we all</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.490" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">know who are on stage that goes for</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.899" end="00:12:36.899" style="s2">people like you and I who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:38.610" style="s2">sort of tell the story of these people</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.899" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">go through people following it I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.610" end="00:12:42.089" style="s2">we all have to just sort of be honest</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:43.860" style="s2">about that again laugh about it a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.089" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">bit it&#39;s if there&#39;s anything that binds</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.860" end="00:12:49.380" style="s2">us as humans together that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:51.300" style="s2">great thing to sort of you know find</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.380" end="00:12:52.889" style="s2">common ground even with your political</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.300" end="00:12:54.600" style="s2">enemy is like we&#39;re all susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.889" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">these kind of things we should admit</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.600" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">that and then what you do with it is is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">really important because I think there</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:03.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge moment in a personal life</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:06.649" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge moment in a political or</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.750" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">philosophical movement are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.649" end="00:13:11.550" style="s2">reject that part of psychology and do</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:13.740" style="s2">everything you can to suppress it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.550" end="00:13:15.480" style="s2">and overcome it and reach some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.740" end="00:13:17.370" style="s2">Nirvana to use like a religious term</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.480" end="00:13:19.290" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an effort that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.370" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">people take on and maybe success</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.290" end="00:13:24.750" style="s2">or are you going to admit that these are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:26.190" style="s2">trappings that not only even calling</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.750" end="00:13:28.590" style="s2">them trappings might be too negative</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.190" end="00:13:30.930" style="s2">these are facets of a human psychology</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.590" end="00:13:32.910" style="s2">that can actually be beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.930" end="00:13:34.410" style="s2">provide a lot of meaning and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.910" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">figure out a way to massage them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.410" end="00:13:39.990" style="s2">maybe hijack them for ethical ends it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:41.550" style="s2">the word actually a good word to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.990" end="00:13:43.020" style="s2">ponder with it is virtue signaling I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.550" end="00:13:45.570" style="s2">hate when people use the word virtue</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.020" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">signaling it&#39;s something we do and of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.570" end="00:13:49.860" style="s2">course we&#39;ve see sort of the really</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.840" style="s2">disingenuous version of it the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:54.120" style="s2">signaling that&#39;s just like over the top</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.840" end="00:13:56.040" style="s2">and clearly just makes your eyes roll</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.120" end="00:13:57.390" style="s2">the way I just sort of did on camera but</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.040" end="00:13:59.820" style="s2">I think we should all admit that we all</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.390" end="00:14:02.640" style="s2">we&#39;re always virtru signaling and some</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.820" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">in some way and there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.640" end="00:14:06.780" style="s2">ability that again it&#39;s the same choice</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:09.000" style="s2">are you gonna just try to deny that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.780" end="00:14:10.110" style="s2">virtue signal and that any one virtue</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.000" end="00:14:11.850" style="s2">signals and this should be something</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.110" end="00:14:12.990" style="s2">that we stamp out in sort of human</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.850" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">psychology if we&#39;re gonna make any</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.990" end="00:14:19.380" style="s2">progress or do you recognize it as a as</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">a maybe even necessary but permanent</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.380" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">feature of human psychology that we just</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:26.010" style="s2">have to not even contend with but take</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:28.530" style="s2">care of and make sure it&#39;s amplified</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.010" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">towards ethical ends that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.530" end="00:14:32.220" style="s2">a really really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:34.290" style="s2">philosophical split and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.220" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">split that I don&#39;t know I could like pin</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.290" end="00:14:37.770" style="s2">IDW characters in either direction on</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">that split but it&#39;s a split we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.770" end="00:14:42.180" style="s2">talk about often enough because we just</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.830" style="s2">sort of deny that you I think everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.180" end="00:14:46.680" style="s2">assumes the right answer is to reject</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.830" end="00:14:49.080" style="s2">this stuff and just put it and make fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.680" end="00:14:51.390" style="s2">of it and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.080" end="00:14:53.370" style="s2">think that&#39;ll probably that&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.390" end="00:14:55.620" style="s2">be the snake eating its own tail at some</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.370" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">point yeah I remember you you making</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.620" end="00:15:00.450" style="s2">that point about psychology and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">that it was quite a profound realization</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.450" end="00:15:04.440" style="s2">because I think a lot of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">conversations can can become almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.440" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">unrooted from the human world of status</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:17.250" style="s2">prestige and and then sort of then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">get some kind of incentives become</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.250" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">aligned with in any kind of network or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:23.880" style="s2">any kind of organization and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:26.970" style="s2">then you can be in trouble very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.880" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">I mean ironically Eric Weinstein we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:31.510" style="s2">a film with Eric Weinstein that we call</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:34.300" style="s2">glitch to the origin of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.510" end="00:15:38.590" style="s2">and he talked about the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.300" end="00:15:41.170" style="s2">groupthink and how the IDW was a set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.590" end="00:15:42.490" style="s2">disagreeable characters but then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.170" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">got the paradox of when you create a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.490" end="00:15:47.530" style="s2">tribe of none tribal individuals what</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:49.570" style="s2">then happens yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.530" end="00:15:51.340" style="s2">interesting yeah maybe you know I used</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.570" end="00:15:53.470" style="s2">virtual signaling as my example in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.340" end="00:15:59.320" style="s2">last answer to ponder but tribalism is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.470" end="00:16:03.070" style="s2">probably the same kind of challenge or</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.320" end="00:16:06.730" style="s2">facet of human psychology we are we to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.070" end="00:16:10.840" style="s2">deny our evolutionary residue of being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.730" end="00:16:13.300" style="s2">tribal animal is is is foolish I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.840" end="00:16:15.190" style="s2">you that&#39;s it&#39;s probably just a truth</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.300" end="00:16:17.380" style="s2">that we are again we have to do the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.190" end="00:16:21.570" style="s2">sort of decision if you&#39;re gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.380" end="00:16:25.830" style="s2">stamp that out as some sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.570" end="00:16:28.750" style="s2">always toxic and always problematic</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.830" end="00:16:31.180" style="s2">feature or it&#39;s something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.750" end="00:16:32.410" style="s2">at could you build a tribe a moral tribe</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.180" end="00:16:35.500" style="s2">or an ethical tribe or a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.410" end="00:16:38.080" style="s2">tribe yeah I guess I&#39;m less afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.500" end="00:16:40.150" style="s2">the word tribal than probably a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.080" end="00:16:42.190" style="s2">people I see commenting online and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.150" end="00:16:46.420" style="s2">pointing out this tribalism it&#39;s a date</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.190" end="00:16:48.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a powerful feature you know an</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.420" end="00:16:51.370" style="s2">example that I think I&#39;ve also used this</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.190" end="00:16:53.020" style="s2">like something like tribalism I I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.370" end="00:16:56.100" style="s2">to contend ok this is an open question</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.020" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a morally neutral</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.060" end="00:17:10.570" style="s2">and a huge amount of energy comes out</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.740" end="00:17:13.209" style="s2">you discover that that&#39;s it that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.209" end="00:17:16.920" style="s2">just you know those are just quarks</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:21.550" style="s2">splitting at some level and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.920" end="00:17:23.260" style="s2">other quarks flying off of it and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.550" end="00:17:24.540" style="s2">have choices of what you want to do with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.260" end="00:17:26.290" style="s2">that you&#39;ve discovered something</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.540" end="00:17:29.770" style="s2">incredibly powerful when you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.420" end="00:17:38.560" style="s2">you want with it you could probably put</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.210" end="00:21:27.800" style="s2">in that conversation is if it is a group</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.330" end="00:21:30.350" style="s2">of people and we&#39;re imagining some sort</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">of having them in the room but once</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.850" end="00:21:49.700" style="s2">they&#39;re in the room don&#39;t be afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:51.560" style="s2">challenge them and push them on these</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:55.070" style="s2">things and try to discover truth like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.560" end="00:21:56.780" style="s2">said because there are there are ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.070" end="00:21:58.250" style="s2">and conjectures about the way the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.780" end="00:22:01.550" style="s2">universe is even in the moral sphere</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.250" end="00:22:03.980" style="s2">that are that cannot coexist and when</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.550" end="00:22:05.810" style="s2">they both cannot be right that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.980" end="00:22:07.100" style="s2">hope what&#39;s exciting about oh come in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.810" end="00:22:08.600" style="s2">the room we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna hash</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:11.420" style="s2">might not get to the bottom of it but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.070" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna record this and we&#39;re going</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:15.470" style="s2">our long thing and we&#39;re gonna get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.550" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">it and maybe and maybe I think some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:20.300" style="s2">the distaste comes from people watching</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.890" style="s2">some of these IDW conversations and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.300" end="00:22:23.720" style="s2">seeing enough of that it&#39;s a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.890" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">giving a pass being like oh well you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.720" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">know they think really different than</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:28.970" style="s2">differently than me so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:30.590" style="s2">they&#39;re here and it&#39;s like yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.970" end="00:22:33.110" style="s2">think really different than differently</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.590" end="00:22:35.330" style="s2">than you and you&#39;re right so go go hash</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.110" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">it out and maybe they&#39;re you know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.330" end="00:22:40.490" style="s2">seems to be a little not enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">latter part of that recently maybe so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.490" end="00:22:44.420" style="s2">yeah the other big point was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:47.240" style="s2">Pangburn fiasco I mean Pangburn</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.420" end="00:22:49.040" style="s2">obviously put on the Sam Harris Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.110" end="00:22:58.340" style="s2">place and then they folded and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.410" end="00:22:59.930" style="s2">there was some kind of inertia or sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:02.180" style="s2">of forward momentum that was stopped</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.930" end="00:23:04.070" style="s2">around that time of having all of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.840" end="00:23:14.030" style="s2">the other financial draw or the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.290" end="00:23:17.030" style="s2">financial blocks to having these</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.290" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible to have what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">want to have for example would be a sort</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:08.060" style="s2">that&#39;s where you make money so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:12.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a reality that we are contending</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.060" end="00:24:15.320" style="s2">with in these things and is a real is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.650" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">real shame this is to your point about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.320" end="00:24:19.610" style="s2">the Weinsteins and saying that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:22.160" style="s2">intellectual Commerce what was the quote</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.160" end="00:24:26.600" style="s2">forces yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.130" end="00:24:29.750" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a really good concrete</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.600" end="00:24:31.490" style="s2">example of if market forces you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">people&#39;s kids need to go to college and</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:45.020" style="s2">like you said you&#39;ve done the numbers so</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.179" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">trying to tackle that hurdle I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.020" end="00:24:48.110" style="s2">know what the answer will be there might</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">be technological ways to tackle it live</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.110" end="00:24:52.309" style="s2">streaming maybe you can lower the ticket</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.309" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">or sometimes entrepreneurs in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.590" end="00:24:58.520" style="s2">you try to work out the numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.690" end="00:24:59.990" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s solutions out there but</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.049" end="00:25:09.380" style="s2">people I don&#39;t know the right answer it</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.850" end="00:25:11.240" style="s2">mean is that are people getting greedy</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.380" end="00:25:13.190" style="s2">like that&#39;s a question that I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:17.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going to also have to just contend</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.190" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">with and critics of the IDW who this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.390" end="00:25:21.860" style="s2">goes to that general point of bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:23.630" style="s2">psychology and bad philosophy greed is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.860" end="00:25:25.490" style="s2">one of those things we all contend with</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.630" end="00:25:27.260" style="s2">like how much money is too much money if</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.490" end="00:25:29.780" style="s2">someone offers me five million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.260" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">to read an ad for a product that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.780" end="00:25:33.230" style="s2">agree with on my podcast am I going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">read it well five million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.230" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of money I could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.150" style="s2">right here being like no way but you put</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">that check in front of me and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.150" end="00:25:43.700" style="s2">we all should be like that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:46.580" style="s2">tough know to say so you know it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.700" end="00:25:48.980" style="s2">there&#39;s there this isn&#39;t two casts the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.580" end="00:25:50.750" style="s2">seek for moral purity will be the death</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.980" end="00:25:52.520" style="s2">of any movement so we shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">that we should acknowledge that these</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.520" end="00:25:56.929" style="s2">are real factors and people need to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.280" style="s2">paid but is there a limit is there a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.929" end="00:26:01.870" style="s2">point where someone&#39;s gotten paid enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.280" end="00:26:03.950" style="s2">is there a point when you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.870" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">the importance of what&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.950" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">said on stage should be enough to sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">of lower the price yeah you know who am</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:13.610" style="s2">i did who are any of us that save this</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">stuff but I think probably ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.610" end="00:26:17.179" style="s2">these questions or having it at this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.740" style="s2">dark dirty secret in the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.179" end="00:26:19.909" style="s2">world it&#39;s probably a big mistake we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.740" end="00:26:21.530" style="s2">should talk about these things and be</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.909" end="00:26:24.470" style="s2">honest about these things Sam I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.530" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">has been more recently and probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.470" end="00:26:29.030" style="s2">rightfully so when when you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:32.600" style="s2">sought-after and you have a lot of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.030" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">people who you know you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.600" end="00:26:37.730" style="s2">people asking for your attention just</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:38.290" style="s2">setting a price of entry to get me in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.730" end="00:26:41.260" style="s2">the door</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.290" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a decent filter to weed</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.260" end="00:26:46.050" style="s2">out some of the wasting of your time</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:50.560" style="s2">yeah but you could use that to justify</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.050" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">high fees to a certain degree and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.560" end="00:26:54.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah we&#39;re all we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:55.990" style="s2">contending with that maybe maybe what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.220" end="00:26:58.570" style="s2">see a lot of times is this trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.990" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">someone who seemingly organically comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.570" end="00:27:02.590" style="s2">from nowhere and is everywhere doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.030" style="s2">really good work and then they hit some</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.590" end="00:27:07.690" style="s2">level where suddenly they stop</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.030" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">outputting new ideas that&#39;s probably and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.690" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">they start if you were mentioning with</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:13.210" style="s2">Jordan like how much can you tour this</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:14.800" style="s2">one book before you just write maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.210" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">same book and then tour that one again</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.800" end="00:27:19.690" style="s2">because you hit this level that you just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.080" end="00:27:23.740" style="s2">be incentives to create new ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.690" end="00:27:26.830" style="s2">new innovative ideas is is unplugged at</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.740" end="00:27:28.540" style="s2">some certain point that that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.830" end="00:27:31.570" style="s2">shame that I think yeah that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.540" end="00:27:34.990" style="s2">that probably has to be addressed and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.570" end="00:27:36.210" style="s2">talked about in some way yeah we I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.990" end="00:27:39.850" style="s2">we all have to contend with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.210" end="00:27:42.220" style="s2">something that I was really excited</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.850" end="00:27:43.960" style="s2">about at the beginning of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.220" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">the emergence of the IDW and I first</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:48.670" style="s2">found out about through the Rubin report</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:50.410" style="s2">and a couple of shows on on the Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.670" end="00:27:53.290" style="s2">report I remember one with Ben Shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.410" end="00:27:55.450" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson and another one with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.290" end="00:27:57.100" style="s2">Bret and Eric where you just really got</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.450" end="00:28:00.820" style="s2">the sense of a conversation that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.100" end="00:28:02.680" style="s2">going somewhere and because in implicit</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.820" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">in the way that the IDW is framed is</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.680" end="00:28:07.420" style="s2">that people might change their minds</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:11.740" style="s2">that you could you and I I haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.420" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">that same sense of excitement or I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.740" end="00:28:14.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen that same sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.000" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">excitement in many of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.230" end="00:28:18.700" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen since especially with</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:21.160" style="s2">those core group from from from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.700" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">beginning and and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.160" end="00:28:24.520" style="s2">aliveness to a conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:26.860" style="s2">someone might change their minds or</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.520" end="00:28:28.600" style="s2">their open-mindedly inquiring into</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.860" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">something and there&#39;s a curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.600" end="00:28:33.460" style="s2">there&#39;s an adult an evolving perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:36.430" style="s2">on both sides and I haven&#39;t felt that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:38.920" style="s2">kind of a live quality for many of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.430" end="00:28:41.980" style="s2">discussions that I can remember probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.920" end="00:28:44.020" style="s2">over the last few months or so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.980" end="00:28:46.150" style="s2">think I think I feel the same kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.020" end="00:28:48.160" style="s2">you know I know a lot of these guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:50.230" style="s2">personally and I basically keep saying I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:51.730" style="s2">you know I&#39;m like write more books like</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.230" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">put something out put out an</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.730" end="00:28:58.060" style="s2">thisis let&#39;s talk about it let&#39;s argue</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:29:00.010" style="s2">about it yeah if some I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.060" end="00:29:02.470" style="s2">can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.010" end="00:29:06.460" style="s2">India in the conversation of mind change</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.470" end="00:29:08.110" style="s2">in real time like that well maybe I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.460" end="00:29:11.290" style="s2">seen some of them go the wrong the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.110" end="00:29:13.660" style="s2">way actually I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.290" end="00:29:15.130" style="s2">topic like abortion is out there that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.660" end="00:29:17.260" style="s2">gets tossed around a little bit in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.130" end="00:29:18.580" style="s2">and there&#39;s totally it if the IDW is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.260" end="00:29:20.500" style="s2">group of people and we have sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.580" end="00:29:23.290" style="s2">same names in mind there are disparate</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.500" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">outcomes of that question that are just</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.290" end="00:29:27.070" style="s2">there as a mess on the floor in that IDW</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:28.360" style="s2">room there really ought to be looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.070" end="00:29:29.860" style="s2">and picked up because I think there</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.360" end="00:29:31.660" style="s2">there are definitive right and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.860" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">answers in that space or definitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.660" end="00:29:35.650" style="s2">better and worse questions to ask to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:38.140" style="s2">probe that that aren&#39;t even being asked</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.650" end="00:29:40.090" style="s2">I mean Dave Rubin has been at the center</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.140" end="00:29:42.670" style="s2">of a lot of the criticisms of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.090" end="00:29:44.860" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen especially in the last</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.670" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">few months I think and I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.860" end="00:29:47.740" style="s2">an interview with him where I put a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:49.240" style="s2">of those questions to him</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.740" end="00:29:52.180" style="s2">because I have a look back at some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.240" end="00:29:55.090" style="s2">the previous shows and I kind of agreed</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.180" end="00:29:56.740" style="s2">with it&#39;s not it&#39;s not whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.090" end="00:29:59.050" style="s2">certain people on your show I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:01.180" style="s2">think you completely should have free</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.050" end="00:30:03.460" style="s2">rein to have anyone and speak to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.180" end="00:30:05.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s about whether you&#39;re giving the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.460" end="00:30:07.450" style="s2">audience enough perspective giving them</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.380" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">enough information to make up their</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.450" end="00:30:11.860" style="s2">minds about who these people are and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.580" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">I think valuable questions can be asked</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.860" end="00:30:17.460" style="s2">and and you mentioned about sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:20.410" style="s2">the the need for self correction and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.460" end="00:30:22.150" style="s2">we I think it&#39;s fair to say we&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.410" end="00:30:23.590" style="s2">really seen that with with Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.150" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen him get very very defensive</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.590" end="00:30:30.160" style="s2">very very triggered by a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">criticism that he&#39;s getting yeah yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.160" end="00:30:35.020" style="s2">yes he does not if you point out errors</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:36.910" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t seem to take it he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.020" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">seem to take it in good faith and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.910" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not from everyone in good faith but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:44.470" style="s2">I have a lot of open questions about</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:47.410" style="s2">watching what&#39;s happened with Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.470" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">and I don&#39;t so I want to preface this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.410" end="00:30:50.950" style="s2">again whenever I talk about Dave I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:52.780" style="s2">mean this personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.950" end="00:30:54.250" style="s2">I want I want to put out I interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.780" end="00:30:57.260" style="s2">him for my film didn&#39;t make the cut but</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.250" end="00:30:59.210" style="s2">he was gracious to give me his time and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.260" end="00:31:01.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve met him a few times and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.210" end="00:31:05.270" style="s2">really nice guy none of this is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.280" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">be a personal attack on on dave rubin</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.270" end="00:31:13.790" style="s2">but i have open questions about watching</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">watching his sort of trajectory as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.790" end="00:31:20.630" style="s2">said sort of in this conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:25.030" style="s2">gosh I don&#39;t know a polite way to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.630" end="00:31:29.690" style="s2">this but I wonder if we underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.030" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">the well there&#39;s the intellect and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.690" end="00:31:37.190" style="s2">intelligence that maybe it takes to sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">of walk away from a tribe that you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.190" end="00:31:42.160" style="s2">captivated by because suddenly you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:45.350" style="s2">the wilderness and it&#39;s a dark place and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.160" end="00:31:47.990" style="s2">maybe going back to sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:49.820" style="s2">tribal instincts we have the lure of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.990" end="00:31:52.220" style="s2">finding a new tribe you might not even</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.820" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">be conscious of it but is there because</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.220" end="00:31:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;s safe there&#39;s safety in numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.830" style="s2">it&#39;s dark in the wilderness and you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.640" end="00:31:59.330" style="s2">to be near other warm animals who</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.830" end="00:32:01.160" style="s2">provide all this protection and some</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.330" end="00:32:03.049" style="s2">evolutionary way again like these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.160" end="00:32:06.380" style="s2">are not unique today if these things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.049" end="00:32:08.270" style="s2">not unique to any of us but they might</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.380" end="00:32:11.419" style="s2">you know that things are not distributed</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.270" end="00:32:15.470" style="s2">even evenly in the world and Dave might</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.419" end="00:32:16.970" style="s2">have a high you know a potent version of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.470" end="00:32:20.210" style="s2">that in his own psychology I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.970" end="00:32:21.620" style="s2">famously stand-up comics always sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.210" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">get knocked for you know they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.620" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">they just want validation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.900" style="s2">they&#39;re their whole thing maybe he was</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:30.410" style="s2">selected a little bit for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.900" end="00:32:32.150" style="s2">of entrenchment and and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.410" end="00:32:34.340" style="s2">by accident he&#39;s got himself in trench</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.150" end="00:32:37.640" style="s2">but talking about Dave Rubin in this way</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.340" end="00:32:39.950" style="s2">as I think you and I are trying to do as</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.640" end="00:32:42.500" style="s2">again I don&#39;t mean this to be dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.950" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">or some jerky thing to say but as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.500" end="00:32:47.929" style="s2">cautionary tale that walking into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:50.179" style="s2">wilderness and finding yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.929" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">wilderness or as Dave would probably put</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.179" end="00:32:53.630" style="s2">it he didn&#39;t go anywhere the left left</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:55.730" style="s2">him or whatever finding yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.630" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">wilderness is a vulnerable dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.730" end="00:33:03.290" style="s2">spot to be and it&#39;s and it&#39;s and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:04.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a time where maybe you could fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.290" end="00:33:06.530" style="s2">you could fall into conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.760" end="00:33:09.049" style="s2">very easily in that state you could fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.530" end="00:33:10.870" style="s2">into violence and that&#39;s that you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.049" end="00:33:15.040" style="s2">fall into a lot of directions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.870" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">state that we again I don&#39;t mean this to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.040" end="00:33:19.960" style="s2">be condescending but I have compassion</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:22.150" style="s2">for the I will just call it the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.960" end="00:33:23.800" style="s2">that Dave has made of ending up well</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.150" end="00:33:26.380" style="s2">hopefully not ending but being in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.800" end="00:33:28.990" style="s2">place where he&#39;s in now because I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.380" end="00:33:33.010" style="s2">we all I don&#39;t know how it would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.990" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">gone for me in the post 9/11 waking up</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.010" end="00:33:36.970" style="s2">period that I had which was just much</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:39.580" style="s2">earlier than Dave&#39;s to sort of some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.970" end="00:33:41.740" style="s2">the lunacy on the left if I had Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.580" end="00:33:44.260" style="s2">and I had a YouTube channel that I could</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.740" end="00:33:46.150" style="s2">just start like this maybe I like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.260" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">we&#39;re all dave rubin on some level we</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.150" end="00:33:49.990" style="s2">all have a little dave rubin in us and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:51.520" style="s2">maybe he was a bit unlucky just even</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.990" end="00:33:53.170" style="s2">given the place where he lives he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.520" end="00:33:54.550" style="s2">Los Angeles and he could pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.170" end="00:33:57.550" style="s2">phone and call Sam Harrison get him on</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.550" end="00:34:00.100" style="s2">his first show and get a huge audience I</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.550" end="00:34:02.530" style="s2">mean a lot of things had to fell in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.100" end="00:34:04.210" style="s2">place for Dave Rubin to be Dave Rubin it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.530" end="00:34:06.520" style="s2">probably would have been better for him</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.210" end="00:34:08.080" style="s2">if he was just a kid in Minnesota</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.520" end="00:34:10.899" style="s2">without those connections who would have</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.080" end="00:34:13.240" style="s2">maybe gone through that initial I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.899" end="00:34:14.830" style="s2">know angst and like wanting to like</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.240" end="00:34:17.740" style="s2">throw a middle finger up to the left</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.830" end="00:34:19.450" style="s2">that abandoned him when maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.740" end="00:34:20.620" style="s2">audience wasn&#39;t so big and maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.450" end="00:34:22.899" style="s2">would have sorted some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.620" end="00:34:24.820" style="s2">out and seen in the mirror a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.899" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">of like okay this this might feel good</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:29.590" style="s2">for a minute but this is not this is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.429" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">where the real show it I was also a fan</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.590" end="00:34:32.440" style="s2">of Dave Rubens show you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:34.600" style="s2">beginning and enjoying a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.440" end="00:34:37.510" style="s2">conversations I think having a hunch</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.600" end="00:34:39.790" style="s2">that he was in a vulnerable spot but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.510" end="00:34:42.129" style="s2">remember pretty clearly the moment where</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.790" end="00:34:43.629" style="s2">I was like man yeah like personally</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.129" end="00:34:44.950" style="s2">offended by it so I will take this one</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.629" end="00:34:47.470" style="s2">personally and that you could call this</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.950" end="00:34:51.550" style="s2">one a bit of an attack but people like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.470" end="00:34:53.560" style="s2">you and I in this field of storytellers</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.550" end="00:34:57.010" style="s2">trying to amplify this with the video</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.560" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">tools that we have here I take the job</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.010" end="00:35:01.990" style="s2">really seriously I know it&#39;s you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:03.640" style="s2">take it too seriously sometimes but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.990" end="00:35:04.930" style="s2">take it really seriously that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.640" end="00:35:06.460" style="s2">privilege to be able to have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.930" end="00:35:08.770" style="s2">conversations and it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.460" end="00:35:10.540" style="s2">responsibility to be able to have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.770" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">conversations and to edit these things I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:16.210" style="s2">mean taking taking hours and hours of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:18.670" style="s2">footage of someone with really big ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.210" end="00:35:20.530" style="s2">that they&#39;ve spent years crafting and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.670" end="00:35:22.359" style="s2">working out and being very careful about</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.530" end="00:35:23.869" style="s2">the language they choose and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.359" end="00:35:26.539" style="s2">and I are the ones who have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.869" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">like tasks to try to deliver that to an</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.539" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">audience who might only have 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:31.579" style="s2">in their car that&#39;s a I take it</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:33.470" style="s2">seriously and so I do a ton of homework</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.579" end="00:35:35.269" style="s2">if I&#39;m gonna interview someone and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.470" end="00:35:36.680" style="s2">doing this podcast now and I have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.269" end="00:35:39.470" style="s2">people that I&#39;m interviewing I read</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.680" end="00:35:41.059" style="s2">their books I read articles I try to dig</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.470" end="00:35:42.890" style="s2">in as much as I can I talk to friends</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.059" end="00:35:45.650" style="s2">about it I batted it around with myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.890" end="00:35:48.559" style="s2">I spend a lot of time before the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.650" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">question is asked with what you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.559" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">with doing my homework and it became</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:55.849" style="s2">clear to me actually this this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:58.089" style="s2">to one of your questions about tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.849" end="00:36:00.049" style="s2">it was an interview with Amy Chua and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.089" end="00:36:03.019" style="s2">Amy Chua wrote a book called political</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.049" end="00:36:06.680" style="s2">tribes that I absolutely loved and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.019" end="00:36:09.319" style="s2">read it and learned a lot from it and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.680" end="00:36:10.519" style="s2">and it shifted my thinking on actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.319" end="00:36:12.799" style="s2">this question of tribalism I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.519" end="00:36:15.109" style="s2">probably honing a lot of her influence</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.799" end="00:36:17.539" style="s2">in my answer to you about tribalism as</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.109" end="00:36:19.039" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not this evil thing to stamp</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.539" end="00:36:22.789" style="s2">out but actually something to understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.039" end="00:36:25.130" style="s2">and we and we absolutely pretending it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.789" end="00:36:26.509" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist is a huge fatal mistake</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.130" end="00:36:28.009" style="s2">and has been a fatal mistake it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.509" end="00:36:30.289" style="s2">great book it&#39;s a short book I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.009" end="00:36:31.700" style="s2">everyone reading it but I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.289" end="00:36:32.930" style="s2">happen where it&#39;s actually Michael</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.700" end="00:36:34.249" style="s2">Shermer who was another person who I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.930" end="00:36:38.239" style="s2">think who has made some mistakes but</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.249" end="00:36:40.849" style="s2">Michael Shermer brought Amy Chua to Dave</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.239" end="00:36:42.920" style="s2">Rubin because Michael read her book and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.849" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">maybe also saw a lot of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.920" end="00:36:47.269" style="s2">liked a lot of it and also realized he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.859" style="s2">friends with Dave was like out Dave</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.269" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">really needs to hear this because Dave</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.859" end="00:36:52.670" style="s2">you know Dave&#39;s making some mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:57.079" style="s2">that this could really correct he like</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.670" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">brought her to the studio and when I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.079" end="00:37:01.069" style="s2">watched their interview it was Michael</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:03.499" style="s2">and Amy and then I think he had Amy on</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.069" end="00:37:05.569" style="s2">solo it was clear to me after five</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.499" end="00:37:07.759" style="s2">minutes that Dave Reuben maybe he looked</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.569" end="00:37:09.769" style="s2">at a Wikipedia article at best but</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.759" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">hadn&#39;t read the book hadn&#39;t done an</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.769" end="00:37:15.170" style="s2">ounce of homework of this thing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">questions he was asking were so asinine</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.170" end="00:37:20.450" style="s2">towards her that again has someone in</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">the industry who sits in his chair often</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.450" end="00:37:24.200" style="s2">I was just offended by being like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:25.460" style="s2">have this incredible intellect in front</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.200" end="00:37:27.470" style="s2">of you and someone who did a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:30.019" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t even take the time to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.470" end="00:37:31.880" style="s2">the homework to read her book and so on</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.019" end="00:37:33.380" style="s2">a personal level I was offended by it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.880" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">there might be some people who could get</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.380" end="00:37:36.319" style="s2">away with that like a Joe Rogan could</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">just come in and wing it and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.319" end="00:37:39.530" style="s2">curious but Dave has</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:41.120" style="s2">agenda on that show I don&#39;t care what he</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.530" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">says about I&#39;m just talking to people if</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.120" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">you watch that well you maybe not even</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:47.270" style="s2">agenda but he has an opinion a political</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">opinion which he&#39;s allowed to have but</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.270" end="00:37:51.110" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna ask the questions with</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:53.360" style="s2">some with some narrative that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.110" end="00:37:55.610" style="s2">looking for her answer to fit into it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.360" end="00:37:57.710" style="s2">just totally disingenuous to your guests</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.610" end="00:38:00.260" style="s2">to treat them that way and so just on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.710" end="00:38:02.330" style="s2">pure like filmmaker and promise to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.260" end="00:38:05.510" style="s2">audience and your guests level I was I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.330" end="00:38:09.080" style="s2">was personally offended by that one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.510" end="00:38:12.020" style="s2">my frustrations generally maybe with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.080" end="00:38:15.080" style="s2">the corner of the IDW that Dave occupies</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.020" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">is that there is the the stereotype sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.080" end="00:38:21.380" style="s2">of SJW nineteen year old girl with</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:23.270" style="s2">purple hair and screaming about you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.380" end="00:38:24.680" style="s2">systemic racism or something on college</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.270" end="00:38:26.840" style="s2">campuses that rightfully should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.680" end="00:38:29.540" style="s2">lampooned and criticized but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.840" end="00:38:32.210" style="s2">also an opposite version of that of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:34.310" style="s2">19 year old usually boy wearing a bowtie</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.210" end="00:38:36.620" style="s2">who like red one and Rand book and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.310" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">thinks that libertarianism is like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.620" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">know is the only philosophy of the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.050" style="s2">that they&#39;ll ever need in their life and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.550" style="s2">and they&#39;ll go about their that person</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.050" end="00:38:45.740" style="s2">should also be Lampoon because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.550" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">they&#39;re both incredibly we know lazy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.740" end="00:38:54.440" style="s2">harmful ideological positions to be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.680" end="00:38:56.180" style="s2">and so has Dave sort of allied with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.440" end="00:38:57.620" style="s2">stereotype on the other side in some</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.180" end="00:38:59.390" style="s2">ways certainly I don&#39;t want to cast</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.620" end="00:39:01.550" style="s2">aspersions on his fans but it probably a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.390" end="00:39:03.500" style="s2">lot of them are also his fans there</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.550" end="00:39:05.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper end of the pool they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.500" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">like waiting in the shallow end I hope</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.630" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">for Dave&#39;s sake of his own intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:14.390" style="s2">journey that he can break out of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:16.940" style="s2">and continue to go but it&#39;s uh he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.390" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">found a lucrative shallow and say that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.940" end="00:39:22.490" style="s2">share your concerns about it seeming</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:25.130" style="s2">unfair to focus on on Dave but I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.490" end="00:39:26.600" style="s2">the reason why the reason why I did the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.130" end="00:39:28.430" style="s2">interview in the way that I did and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.600" end="00:39:30.140" style="s2">reason that I&#39;m kind of interested to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.430" end="00:39:33.230" style="s2">return to it in the context of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.140" end="00:39:36.140" style="s2">is that that was as Dave said in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.230" end="00:39:38.390" style="s2">interview with with me his his garage</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.140" end="00:39:39.890" style="s2">was kind of the home of the IDW it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.390" end="00:39:43.250" style="s2">where a lot of the initial connections</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.890" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">were made and it&#39;s where a lot so it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.250" end="00:39:49.420" style="s2">the place where when there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">criticisms that the flaws in in Dave&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.420" end="00:39:52.460" style="s2">thinking and before</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.470" style="s2">moments are then sort of massively</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.460" end="00:39:56.450" style="s2">highlighted I think there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.470" end="00:39:59.770" style="s2">different pieces that we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.450" end="00:40:02.660" style="s2">unpack and they&#39;re all very useful</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.770" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">learning experiences for for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.660" end="00:40:07.820" style="s2">one of which is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:10.130" style="s2">replace a high-resolution critique with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.820" end="00:40:11.570" style="s2">a low resolution critique and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.130" end="00:40:14.990" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.570" end="00:40:16.970" style="s2">for the IDW is how do you how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.990" end="00:40:19.640" style="s2">do you find a path through that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.970" end="00:40:22.040" style="s2">sort of very complex arguments around</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.640" end="00:40:23.960" style="s2">say sex and gender for example without</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.040" end="00:40:25.850" style="s2">slipping into a low resolution critique</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.960" end="00:40:28.220" style="s2">these are very difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.850" end="00:40:30.170" style="s2">that have to be had at this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.220" end="00:40:32.750" style="s2">higher level and as soon as you come</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.170" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">down to a low resolution partially true</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.750" end="00:40:37.670" style="s2">critique of the left for example then</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:40.460" style="s2">then your that that&#39;s a really dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.670" end="00:40:42.200" style="s2">place to be yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.460" end="00:40:43.940" style="s2">interesting yeah I like that I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.200" end="00:40:46.280" style="s2">as the thought that popped into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.940" end="00:40:48.770" style="s2">it would be impossible but it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.280" end="00:40:52.340" style="s2">should somehow have like there should be</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.770" end="00:40:54.020" style="s2">a podcast or a YouTube situation where</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.340" end="00:40:55.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like impossible to only listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.020" end="00:40:57.470" style="s2">five minutes like if you start it your</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.910" end="00:40:58.820" style="s2">hat you can&#39;t get out of but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:01.370" style="s2">get out of it for at least half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.820" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s a really astute</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.370" end="00:41:05.240" style="s2">point though is you know a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:07.640" style="s2">information could be a dangerous thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.240" end="00:41:09.260" style="s2">it&#39;s famously like the this mount stupid</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.640" end="00:41:10.310" style="s2">graph that you know you get a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.260" end="00:41:11.210" style="s2">information and suddenly you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.310" end="00:41:12.440" style="s2">you&#39;re a genius</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.210" end="00:41:14.120" style="s2">you get a little and for more</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.440" end="00:41:18.260" style="s2">information and you realize you got a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.120" end="00:41:20.950" style="s2">long way to go yeah yeah you could you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.260" end="00:41:24.620" style="s2">could misunderstand and misinterpret</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.950" end="00:41:25.910" style="s2">really big ideas that are so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.620" end="00:41:27.830" style="s2">splitting the atom again it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.910" end="00:41:29.390" style="s2">could you can make some monumental</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.830" end="00:41:31.820" style="s2">mistakes if you miss understand I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.390" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">been looking at you know Darwin and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.820" end="00:41:34.310" style="s2">Darwinian ISM and the mistakes that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:36.920" style="s2">people make about understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.310" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">evolution if you hear survival of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.920" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">fittest and then you walk away and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:42.410" style="s2">think you know what that means and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:44.380" style="s2">go run with it you can you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.410" end="00:41:47.420" style="s2">horror show on earth pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.380" end="00:41:50.830" style="s2">because that idea is even wrong but even</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.420" end="00:41:53.960" style="s2">to just to know what&#39;s wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.830" end="00:41:56.270" style="s2">takes a long time I think actually you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.960" end="00:41:59.600" style="s2">know that&#39;s why someone like Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.270" end="00:42:02.350" style="s2">who I love obviously I work with he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.600" end="00:42:04.310" style="s2">not he&#39;s an incredible we need more</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.350" end="00:42:06.650" style="s2">communicators of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.310" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">Sam Sam is a philosophy communicator the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.650" end="00:42:09.710" style="s2">way that Carl Sagan was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:11.510" style="s2">scientist that really a science educator</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.710" end="00:42:16.040" style="s2">because he had this incredible ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.510" end="00:42:18.970" style="s2">to study and understand big complicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.040" end="00:42:22.130" style="s2">ideas of science and then deliver it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.970" end="00:42:24.619" style="s2">within a pretty concise way that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.130" end="00:42:25.460" style="s2">entertaining and poetic and really would</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.619" end="00:42:27.619" style="s2">do the job</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.460" end="00:42:29.480" style="s2">Sam is incredibly good at that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.619" end="00:42:32.150" style="s2">writing a book on determinism he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.480" end="00:42:33.890" style="s2">not he is not the first one he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.150" end="00:42:35.840" style="s2">the millionth and a half one to say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.890" end="00:42:37.670" style="s2">free will is an illusion but he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.840" end="00:42:39.050" style="s2">really cool short book about it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.670" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">shorter than a lot of the other books</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.050" end="00:42:42.470" style="s2">out there on it and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:44.869" style="s2">real talent in that I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.470" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">moral landscape is probably you know his</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.869" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">original thesis that that deserves</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:51.290" style="s2">critique as an original idea but most of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:53.900" style="s2">his books and most of his work is</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.290" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">incredible philosophy communication and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.900" end="00:42:59.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s a really valuable skill and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:02.060" style="s2">we need more of that especially maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.240" end="00:43:03.710" style="s2">this you know attention span as you were</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.060" end="00:43:05.630" style="s2">pointing out earlier the incentives of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.710" end="00:43:08.900" style="s2">traditional media where you only have</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.630" end="00:43:11.290" style="s2">you know a minute to speak if you can if</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.900" end="00:43:13.609" style="s2">you can compress sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.290" end="00:43:16.010" style="s2">hundreds of years of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.609" end="00:43:17.570" style="s2">thinking into into a compressible thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.010" end="00:43:21.020" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a really really good skill</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.570" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">but of course there are really bad ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.020" end="00:43:25.220" style="s2">to do it there&#39;s bad ways to make a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">low-resolution version of a file where</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.220" end="00:43:29.840" style="s2">you actually miss all the good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:31.340" style="s2">whether it&#39;s an image that just becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.840" end="00:43:33.650" style="s2">so pixelated that you can&#39;t see what</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.340" end="00:43:35.060" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at anymore or you know it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.650" end="00:43:38.690" style="s2">but there&#39;s really good ways to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.060" end="00:43:41.690" style="s2">whatever algorithm turns you know a five</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.690" end="00:43:43.550" style="s2">gig wave into a hundred Meg mp3 and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.690" end="00:43:46.280" style="s2">still sounds really good that algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.550" end="00:43:47.960" style="s2">is in tremendously valuable tool and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.280" end="00:43:50.660" style="s2">you if that analogy works with almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.960" end="00:43:53.660" style="s2">the people who become the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.660" end="00:43:55.850" style="s2">that could take you know terabytes of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.660" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">information and compress it and deliver</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.850" end="00:44:00.470" style="s2">it to you but that&#39;s not always doable</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:01.070" style="s2">or easy and we Nate we might not be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.470" end="00:44:03.109" style="s2">there yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.070" end="00:44:05.300" style="s2">where you might need a three-hour long</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.109" end="00:44:07.010" style="s2">podcast or four nights with Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.300" end="00:44:08.690" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson talking about truth</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.010" end="00:44:10.010" style="s2">and never getting anywhere and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.690" end="00:44:11.990" style="s2">they probably needed four more nights</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.010" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">and they needed and that&#39;s great but</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.990" end="00:44:16.130" style="s2">that you know okay that sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.100" style="s2">the best we can do is you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.130" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">to get this in five</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.100" end="00:44:21.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get this in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:23.970" style="s2">because I don&#39;t get this in a minute so</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.150" end="00:44:25.170" style="s2">you know if I think Einstein has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.970" end="00:44:28.260" style="s2">of great quotes about that something</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.170" end="00:44:29.550" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t understand it if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.260" end="00:44:31.170" style="s2">can&#39;t explain it simply you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.550" end="00:44:33.900" style="s2">understand it some all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.170" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">stuff or whatever but yeah there it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.900" end="00:44:37.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really crucial important</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:40.770" style="s2">point and maybe that&#39;s again the day of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.500" end="00:44:43.110" style="s2">Reuben criticism of like you know you do</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.770" end="00:44:47.070" style="s2">more homework it&#39;s the the low the low</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.110" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">resolution sort of you know ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.070" end="00:44:52.680" style="s2">owns and SJW is not helping anyone so i</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.090" style="s2">want to kind of wrap up by coming back</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.680" end="00:44:56.310" style="s2">to a point that you may write at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.090" end="00:44:58.830" style="s2">beginning which was the difference</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.310" end="00:45:00.780" style="s2">between politics or that your concerns</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">about the IDW was that whether it was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.780" end="00:45:06.780" style="s2">political thing rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:08.820" style="s2">philosophical thing and yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.780" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">really interesting point because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.820" end="00:45:15.480" style="s2">nature of politics comes if you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:18.330" style="s2">break it down it&#39;s not an inquiry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.480" end="00:45:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s when inquiry stops it&#39;s it&#39;s got an</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.330" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">agenda it&#39;s got an end it&#39;s like when</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.190" end="00:45:26.010" style="s2">one inquiry collapses into activism or</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:28.860" style="s2">collapses into politics it lacks that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.010" end="00:45:31.890" style="s2">kind of a live sense of curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.860" end="00:45:33.600" style="s2">openness and and evolution and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.890" end="00:45:35.400" style="s2">not even that&#39;s not even - not that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.600" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">what politics is it&#39;s like we sat in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:40.170" style="s2">room we thought about this or we did the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:42.120" style="s2">studies and we were going with this</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.170" end="00:45:43.260" style="s2">answer and we&#39;re gonna try to push it</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.120" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try it out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.260" end="00:45:46.890" style="s2">world and politics is how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.470" style="s2">enough people to pull the lever so we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.890" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">try this idea that&#39;s that is what</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.470" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">politics is you know I think like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:56.870" style="s2">natural push back someone would have if</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:58.890" style="s2">they hear a criticism of oh the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.870" end="00:46:01.320" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be political or is too</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.890" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">political or something as and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.320" end="00:46:03.480" style="s2">even know if this is a good point</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:04.590" style="s2">they&#39;ll point out like well look at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.480" end="00:46:06.390" style="s2">these people with their disparate</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.590" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">political ideas and their disparate</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.390" end="00:46:09.420" style="s2">political outcomes I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:13.830" style="s2">different point than the one I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.420" end="00:46:16.260" style="s2">it is like if it&#39;s people who are have</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.830" end="00:46:19.770" style="s2">political agendas no matter what they</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.260" end="00:46:22.080" style="s2">are which on some some ways we all do</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.770" end="00:46:24.450" style="s2">but if that&#39;s the practice of IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.080" end="00:46:26.190" style="s2">pushing a political agenda or even</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.450" end="00:46:28.080" style="s2">denigrating another political agenda</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.190" end="00:46:31.080" style="s2">just for the sake of something else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.080" end="00:46:35.190" style="s2">I think that&#39;s not only is it boring</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.080" end="00:46:37.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s nothing it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.190" end="00:46:38.190" style="s2">new it&#39;s not a reaction to anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.020" end="00:46:40.740" style="s2">that&#39;s probably that&#39;s what we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.190" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">doing before it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.740" end="00:46:45.450" style="s2">political reaction to a political</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:47.310" style="s2">mistake and that&#39;s not that&#39;s not new</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.450" end="00:46:49.350" style="s2">that&#39;s not like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.310" end="00:46:51.360" style="s2">people came to the room</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.350" end="00:46:52.500" style="s2">I think people came to the room because</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.360" end="00:46:54.180" style="s2">they had a hunch that there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.500" end="00:46:56.280" style="s2">questions that they couldn&#39;t ask and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.180" end="00:46:57.960" style="s2">there was answers that they thought were</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.280" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">out there or that there were answers</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.960" end="00:47:04.020" style="s2">that they had a hunch where were you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.980" end="00:47:06.540" style="s2">know being pushed upon them that just</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.020" end="00:47:09.540" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly be true whether on sex</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.710" end="00:50:12.030" style="s2">huge show in New York and all these</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.690" end="00:50:13.890" style="s2">tickets were sold and then famously two</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.030" end="00:50:15.600" style="s2">days before the event he sends out an</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.890" end="00:50:17.820" style="s2">email saying he folded the company and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.600" end="00:50:20.460" style="s2">anyway huge fiasco but suddenly people</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.820" end="00:50:22.650" style="s2">were coming to New York and who all were</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.460" end="00:50:24.840" style="s2">sort of in this space on some level they</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.650" end="00:50:26.760" style="s2">were coming to hear the likes of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.840" end="00:50:30.270" style="s2">and Sam and all these names that we know</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.760" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">and we a bunch of us sort of organically</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.270" end="00:50:33.180" style="s2">got together being like can we do</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:34.770" style="s2">anything for these people like we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:36.990" style="s2">these contacts like they&#39;re all coming</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.990" end="00:50:40.320" style="s2">out a random like Eventbrite tweet he</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.120" end="00:50:41.910" style="s2">was one of the many who had bought a</p>

<p begin="00:50:41.910" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">coming anyway i retweeted it one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.520" end="00:50:48.390" style="s2">those random little viral moments and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:50.130" style="s2">reached out to Ryan anyway when I met</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.390" end="00:50:52.200" style="s2">him we just became fast friends famously</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.130" end="00:50:55.170" style="s2">the Pangburn event that didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.200" end="00:50:57.080" style="s2">turned into this kind of impromptu party</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.170" end="00:50:59.630" style="s2">in Manhattan</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.080" end="00:51:01.670" style="s2">with at bars and at different places and</p>

<p begin="00:51:01.670" end="00:51:05.540" style="s2">some of the figures like Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:07.490" style="s2">who talked to people when he could from</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.540" end="00:51:11.600" style="s2">afar and Coleman was there Coleman</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.490" end="00:51:13.130" style="s2">Hughes and you know probably no surprise</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.130" end="00:51:16.550" style="s2">saying like this was better than the if</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.810" end="00:51:19.160" style="s2">the event had even happened because on</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.550" end="00:51:21.890" style="s2">some level you buy a ticket to go see</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.160" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">Sam Harris or or Erik Weinstein or</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.890" end="00:51:24.470" style="s2">whatever and you kind of know what</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.830" end="00:51:30.320" style="s2">great it&#39;s great to hear maybe real</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.940" end="00:51:32.270" style="s2">improv a little this time and do</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.320" end="00:51:34.550" style="s2">something new or here&#39;s a new song it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.270" end="00:51:37.340" style="s2">great but really you&#39;re there in so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.550" end="00:51:39.320" style="s2">ways to like be with other people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.340" end="00:51:42.110" style="s2">are also have their ear to the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.320" end="00:51:44.570" style="s2">this conversation and so what what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.110" end="00:51:46.550" style="s2">launched was and then and then to finish</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.570" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">that maybe frustration is then the event</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.550" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">ends and everyone goes home and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:53.540" style="s2">like the only thing to do is maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">yell about it on Twitter and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.540" end="00:51:59.330" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s we&#39;re seeming we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:00.710" style="s2">missing something to connect the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.330" end="00:52:02.450" style="s2">to change the conversation from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.710" end="00:52:04.010" style="s2">one-to-many that happens when one</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.450" end="00:52:06.530" style="s2">person&#39;s on a stage and many people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.010" end="00:52:09.020" style="s2">out here to the many too many and how do</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.530" end="00:52:10.850" style="s2">we do that so I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.020" end="00:52:12.560" style="s2">simple idea we&#39;re calling it in common</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.850" end="00:52:14.150" style="s2">and we just started doing some tests at</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.560" end="00:52:16.790" style="s2">the Soho forum in New York which are</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.150" end="00:52:19.310" style="s2">going well very early where it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.790" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">simple you come to the event and you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.310" end="00:52:26.210" style="s2">a code and it&#39;s a code that only people</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:27.710" style="s2">at the event have access to and you sign</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.210" end="00:52:29.660" style="s2">up for the code you answer just a few</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.710" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">simple questions of like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.660" end="00:52:32.540" style="s2">available what kind of food you like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:34.520" style="s2">eat what neighborhood you&#39;re in really</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.540" end="00:52:36.530" style="s2">simple stuff we do all the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.520" end="00:52:38.750" style="s2">work behind the scenes and hook you up</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.530" end="00:52:40.520" style="s2">with other people who went to the event</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.750" end="00:52:42.740" style="s2">five or six people whatever it is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.520" end="00:52:44.210" style="s2">there&#39;s Plus Ones and then you go and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.740" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">have dinner with these people or brunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.210" end="00:52:47.690" style="s2">and they launch it&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">neighborhood and it&#39;s it&#39;s could be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.690" end="00:52:51.860" style="s2">next day or a few days late or even on</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">the weekend and meet them and see what</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.860" end="00:52:55.250" style="s2">happens and continue the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:56.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s it it&#39;s just about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.250" end="00:52:58.310" style="s2">simple the work is up to you we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.930" end="00:53:01.100" style="s2">connect you with it at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.310" end="00:53:03.170" style="s2">and then you know make some friends and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.100" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">error correct at the table if you want</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.170" end="00:53:07.640" style="s2">to continue the discussion or talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:09.600" style="s2">whatever you want yeah it&#39;s in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.640" end="00:53:14.230" style="s2">it&#39;s what meetup comm should have</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.600" end="00:53:17.530" style="s2">we have a hunch the meetup.com effort is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.230" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">sort of dissatisfying because there&#39;s</p>
