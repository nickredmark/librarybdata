<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.750" style="s2">hi Dean it&#39;s been a long time I finally</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.639" end="00:00:09.990" style="s2">have a few new things to say at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.750" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">two I&#39;ll start with this one and I will</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.990" end="00:00:16.590" style="s2">leave it to you to decide why it is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">this seems like something to say in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.590" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">context of the other things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">talked about so the notion here is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">something called C Gnaeus the the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">concept was first introduced at least to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:35.579" style="s2">me by German name Brian Eno and he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:38.790" style="s2">endeavoring to name the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.579" end="00:00:42.090" style="s2">there seemed to be a certain genius of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.790" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">scene where some kind of scene would</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.090" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">emerge say like punk rock or</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">skateboarding or Impressionism or</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">quantum mechanics where while the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">individual participants themselves may</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">in fact also be geniuses there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">something about them together or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">emergence of the movement that seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">have its own independent genius and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">he calling that acini as&#39; and friend of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.740" style="s2">mine gentleman named Sebastian Paquette</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:11.930" style="s2">was very interested in this concept and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.740" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">he and I talked about it quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.930" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">while ago actually but eight years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:21.770" style="s2">it seems like and I was recently having</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">a conversation with Tim Kelly and she</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.770" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">recommended that I document the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">seven I were thinking about it so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">this is it basically this is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">expansion you may call it the Macau how</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">did it seems roll out because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">that there&#39;s something characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">about scenes so to begin with a scene is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">very it begins very vague it begins as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">feeling but does not have any voice it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">cannot be said it cannot be seen it does</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">not have any symbolic characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">that are easily shared but he&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">almost a yearning of something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">wants to be and in the beginning there</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">will only be a very small number</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:23.450" style="s2">of people who are uniquely attuned to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:28.710" style="s2">the scene so as to be able to feel it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.450" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">enough has to be able to and attracted</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.710" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">to realizing it in some fashion so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">just use I say Impressionism as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">example so you have your your Monet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s some some feeling in Monet</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">that is orienting him and drawing him</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">towards changing art from</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">representational art to use something</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">else it has no name to it it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">what it is there&#39;s no technique or</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:03:00.230" style="s2">framework but there&#39;s a sense of what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">more right in this in this direction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.230" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">by doing this by acting on this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">he makes it more real he makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">concrete someone else who may not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">able to be as attuned as he is is able</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">to see water lilies and is able to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">there&#39;s something there that is now more</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:22.200" style="s2">clear to me all right so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">progressive development you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.200" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">development of the vague and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">very powerful sense of something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">wants to be and then there&#39;s a people</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">who are somehow uniquely attuned to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:37.830" style="s2">thing that wants to be and some of whom</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:39.540" style="s2">then choose to an endeavor to realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.830" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">the endeavor to actualize it and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.540" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">their actualization they make it more</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">legible they make it more perceivable</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">they make it more real now I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:54.570" style="s2">propose that there seem to be three core</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">call it functions in this first</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.570" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">realization now these are functions</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:04.910" style="s2">meaning that a given person may play all</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">three functions or two or just one and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.910" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">certain people may may play these</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:12.329" style="s2">functions at different points in time it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">is the impossible in principle that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.329" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">may in fact take a whole group of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:22.520" style="s2">to play a given function so so one</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">function I will call source source is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.520" end="00:04:31.710" style="s2">the most in alignment with the essence</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.900" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2">of the sea so an individualist if except</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.710" end="00:04:36.389" style="s2">what particular individual happens to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">play the role of source this individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.389" end="00:04:43.260" style="s2">is the the expressor or the actual Iser</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">of the scene whose expressions in actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.260" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">actualizations are most fully of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">essence of what the scene actually is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.780" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">I&#39;ll get back to this source in a second</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.430" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">the other two I call the charismatic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:07.950" style="s2">the artist the artist plays the role of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">making the scene legible to itself the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.950" end="00:05:13.350" style="s2">artist is kind of developing the palette</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">of expressions that are signature</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.350" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">characteristics of what the scene really</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:26.040" style="s2">is say for example you know the the use</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">of color and light and Impressionism as</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.040" end="00:05:30.030" style="s2">part of the artistry of the palette of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">what it is to be in an impressionist</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.030" end="00:05:37.200" style="s2">painting would say in skateboarding in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:43.490" style="s2">the skateboarding scene it is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.200" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">the the innovation of the ollie is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.490" end="00:05:47.910" style="s2">expansion of the expressive palate of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:49.950" style="s2">the scene itself so the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.910" end="00:05:52.890" style="s2">language or the pattern language in its</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.950" end="00:05:58.070" style="s2">increasing a spring expressivity is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.890" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">domain of artistry the charismatic is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:07.350" style="s2">the function that converts the scene</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:08.940" style="s2">while still being in alignment with this</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.350" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">essence our so this is still playing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.940" end="00:06:13.860" style="s2">role very close to source but converts</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:17.430" style="s2">the scene into expressions to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.860" end="00:06:19.139" style="s2">legibility to the rest of the world all</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.430" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">right so this is kind of what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.139" end="00:06:26.910" style="s2">scene cool or desirable or sexy or</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:32.490" style="s2">interesting you know this might be for</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.910" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">example wearing a leather jacket the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.490" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">studded leather jacket oh with a safety</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.289" style="s2">pin through your nose I believe or your</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:40.789" style="s2">ear I can remote it was an early Punk</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.289" end="00:06:45.090" style="s2">there&#39;s not necessarily part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.789" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">intrinsic palette of Punk to dress Punk</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.090" end="00:06:50.340" style="s2">but it is the characteristic that gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:52.470" style="s2">rise to the expression of punk in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.340" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">that makes it legible to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:55.770" style="s2">world that helps you know what Punk is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.690" style="s2">and by the way it also makes Punk</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.770" end="00:06:59.700" style="s2">attractive to at least those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.690" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">the rest of the world who are attracted</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.700" end="00:07:02.520" style="s2">to the source right because it is still</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:04.530" style="s2">source it is the thing it is expressing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.520" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">itself honestly in a truly end with</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.530" end="00:07:10.320" style="s2">integrity outside so artistry is about</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:12.419" style="s2">creating the language inside it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.320" end="00:07:14.789" style="s2">increasingly capable of expressing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.419" end="00:07:18.740" style="s2">thing for itself and charisma is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.789" end="00:07:22.380" style="s2">creating the aesthetic for expressing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.740" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">outside and by the way also inside so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.380" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">these are the three now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">things that often is the case is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:33.210" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the history of a scene</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">the source is really only known to those</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.210" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">people who are keenly interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.380" style="s2">scene</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:42.510" style="s2">well right I knew her before the scene</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.380" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">got cool this is the kind of the Velvet</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.510" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">Underground or the Pixies it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.630" style="s2">know Drock perhaps I mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:53.789" style="s2">schrodinger everybody knows who shorter</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.789" end="00:08:00.419" style="s2">mechanic groupies know about Dirac but</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.630" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">the idea is that the the source is held</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.419" end="00:08:05.820" style="s2">in very high esteem because the source</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:08.430" style="s2">is so close and so pure in the essence</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.820" end="00:08:09.780" style="s2">of what the scene is but because they</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.430" end="00:08:12.030" style="s2">are not necessarily participating in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.780" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">artistry or charisma they are not as</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">legible in the broader environment okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">and so then these three functions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:23.400" style="s2">again by the way one person can play all</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">three functions and the functions may</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:26.820" style="s2">move you may say that John Lennon may</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.820" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">and charismatic and then sometimes maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.099" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">more source and you know Paul McCartney</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">may been playing more of the role of</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:40.709" style="s2">moving through time and space but as</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">these these functions begin to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.709" end="00:08:45.240" style="s2">embodied and begin to be played out the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:47.880" style="s2">the scene becomes more real it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.240" end="00:08:49.620" style="s2">more legible from the outside it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.880" end="00:08:51.000" style="s2">more capable of people who are attuned</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.620" end="00:08:53.700" style="s2">to it to become more</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.000" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">love sensing how they can act in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.700" end="00:08:58.530" style="s2">context of it and and as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2">more people begin to participate which</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.530" end="00:09:03.840" style="s2">means that you have more reality</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.840" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">and now at a certain critical threshold</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:15.230" style="s2">new kinds of functions begin to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">there for example the function of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.230" end="00:09:23.250" style="s2">journalist the journalist it plays the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:27.710" style="s2">role of communicating the scene to the</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:37.710" style="s2">who was doing the same thing internally</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:38.910" style="s2">like the naming of the scene who named</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:56.520" style="s2">the internet as a scene wasn&#39;t called</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.760" end="00:10:17.070" style="s2">then there&#39;s a identification all right</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:22.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.070" end="00:10:24.510" style="s2">identify who is in the scene this is a</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.510" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">beginning the process of helping the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:31.320" style="s2">emergent rock and roll scene to get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">sense of who is who and what those</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:46.790" style="s2">there are now enthusiasts there are fans</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.230" end="00:10:50.339" style="s2">of the scene these are people who are</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.370" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">you can imagine the scene is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.510" end="00:11:05.170" style="s2">like having a plane</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a circle that starts out</p>
