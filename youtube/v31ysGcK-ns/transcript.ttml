<p begin="00:00:00.290" end="00:00:04.939" style="s2">doing great fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.339" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">could you just sort of the story of</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:16.410" style="s2">crystal waters when it started and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:18.289" style="s2">your involvement was you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">consult any time yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.289" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">we started crystal orders in 1985 when</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:29.609" style="s2">the then owner pop sample approached me</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.420" end="00:00:32.070" style="s2">and I had a trainee at a time</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">Robert tap we&#39;re still living it just</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.070" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">taught us today to with basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">bit-bit tool vicious one to find the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">for a large number of people to live</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">together legally as we have approval</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">from Council the second one also to do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">land use plan we had it took quite some</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">time to convince Council that&#39;s a longer</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:01:03.589" style="s2">story but it basically took three years</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">of design observation and design and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.589" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">submissions to council until we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">approval and people could start the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:16.340" style="s2">moving and so since about nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">eighty seven eighty eight people been</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.340" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">living at Crystal orders and they&#39;ve has</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">steadily grown is still growing to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">point where we today are about close to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">about twenty fifty people and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">always bunch of visitors there as well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">think that the key was to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">convince council that in a rural area it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">is a rural village as it was the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">way to go I think was such a depressed</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">in recession area of they were willing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">to give it a go nothing the important</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">points now is be fulfilled all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">requirements by the council and we still</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">do we pay council rates but we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">self-governing we maintain our on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:09.310" style="s2">road within without on right</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">we produce some of our own energy as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.310" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">well is asked today they produce more</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:21.099" style="s2">food as an eco village than it did as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:23.650" style="s2">farm and we are a catchment so the water</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.099" end="00:02:27.190" style="s2">running off crystal waters goes into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:30.970" style="s2">catchment which is used for water for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.190" end="00:02:33.700" style="s2">living populations and is a WoW life</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.970" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">habitat at the same time I think to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.700" end="00:02:39.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the aspects which I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">happy right and and you said that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.580" end="00:02:42.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of visitors teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:46.630" style="s2">programs could you say a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.940" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2">about the courses here on it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.630" end="00:02:53.769" style="s2">number of people offering courses by</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">Paracelsus ecological solutions the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.769" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">mainly the programs are doing mainly in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:02.440" style="s2">connection with universities from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">United States Japan and Korea the liver</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.440" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">with these universities to provide</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:11.170" style="s2">programs from about two weeks a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:12.940" style="s2">bit more in two weeks 17 days to about</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.170" end="00:03:16.359" style="s2">seven weeks that&#39;s the longest one we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.940" end="00:03:19.450" style="s2">done so far which fit into their</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.359" end="00:03:21.820" style="s2">curriculum so each one each of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.450" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">courses is actually different each time</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.820" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">we produce a new handbook which is from</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">a core handbook we put together and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:35.079" style="s2">allows students to get credits and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:37.420" style="s2">it allows the universities therefore</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.079" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">plays which continues in a way with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.420" end="00:03:43.180" style="s2">education which I can&#39;t really do at</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">university and that part is mainly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.180" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">hands-on aspects but we do also teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:52.569" style="s2">the theory aspects as well but really we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">don&#39;t want to duplicate what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.569" end="00:03:56.980" style="s2">already done at university we want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.370" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">continue and see in a write a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.980" end="00:04:02.920" style="s2">for the theory why they need to go and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:06.880" style="s2">put their heads in the books and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.920" end="00:04:08.440" style="s2">see how it&#39;s applied out in the field in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:11.440" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:14.320" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been teaching permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.440" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">since since when and how how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.320" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">permaculture contributing to a shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:21.670" style="s2">towards a more sustainable society I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:24.790" style="s2">the first permaculture course with Bill</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.670" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">Maher&#39;s in 1979 and the second one with</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.790" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">him in 1980 and then I started teaching</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:34.360" style="s2">1981</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">so that&#39;s 26 years yes and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.360" end="00:04:39.510" style="s2">teaching continuous in that time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">some years I&#39;ll be teaching</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.510" end="00:04:47.170" style="s2">10 courses and last year I think 20</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">weeks of teaching but more now through</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.170" end="00:04:53.890" style="s2">its eco-village design I&#39;ve passed on</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">the purely permaculture teaching two</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.890" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">other people at crystals which have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">able to turn it into an income stream</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:06.850" style="s2">for themselves as I see permaculture is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">a very important way of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.850" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">looking at things I think their</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">observation aspects are really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:18.310" style="s2">people often fail us under the botanist</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.620" end="00:05:20.770" style="s2">or another farmer how can I really ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.310" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">be good at designing using permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.770" end="00:05:26.110" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:28.710" style="s2">as people still see as permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.110" end="00:05:33.820" style="s2">being permanent permanent agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.710" end="00:05:36.790" style="s2">but as it has always been much more and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.820" end="00:05:39.880" style="s2">to me it has always been permanence in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.790" end="00:05:41.800" style="s2">culture and by doing that it has the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.880" end="00:05:46.210" style="s2">design element which is really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.800" end="00:05:48.970" style="s2">the baby put things together and it has</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.210" end="00:05:51.160" style="s2">an element of food growing it has an</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.970" end="00:05:54.340" style="s2">element of spirituality also people</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.160" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">mostly try to deny that very having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.340" end="00:06:01.390" style="s2">very strong aspect of spirituality of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">social awareness of structures like we</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.390" end="00:06:07.000" style="s2">see them around here as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:09.820" style="s2">experimentation but now after all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:11.800" style="s2">time I think we have come to a point</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.820" end="00:06:13.750" style="s2">where I see eco villages or their</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.800" end="00:06:16.900" style="s2">abilities on education which we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.750" end="00:06:19.810" style="s2">offering as part of the lease as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.900" end="00:06:23.320" style="s2">umbrella and permaculture is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.810" end="00:06:27.220" style="s2">aspect of that but other parts are also</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.320" end="00:06:29.889" style="s2">important that like the economy aspect</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.220" end="00:06:31.750" style="s2">and is really important to governance is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">an important one too I think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.750" end="00:06:37.930" style="s2">pretty holistic approach and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:41.830" style="s2">permaculture is part of that holistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.930" end="00:06:43.570" style="s2">approach I think mainly now with youth</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.830" end="00:06:45.790" style="s2">and we do a lot of work with very young</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.570" end="00:06:47.460" style="s2">people there haven&#39;t got the muscle</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.790" end="00:06:50.169" style="s2">memory they haven&#39;t really got</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.460" end="00:06:54.729" style="s2">grandparents who can tell them what food</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.169" end="00:06:58.060" style="s2">really used to taste like and I find</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.729" end="00:07:00.520" style="s2">that a critical period of another</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.060" end="00:07:04.050" style="s2">generation and the memory will be so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:07.479" style="s2">distant that it can&#39;t be probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.050" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">captured anymore if I was in Japan very</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.479" end="00:07:14.740" style="s2">recently and a Japanese person stated</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:18.360" style="s2">that in another 10 to 20 years 3000</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.740" end="00:07:20.830" style="s2">years of Japanese agricultural history</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.360" end="00:07:23.800" style="s2">will be gone will be buried with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.830" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">last farmers who still carry that muscle</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.800" end="00:07:27.010" style="s2">memory and the world should be concerned</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:29.050" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.010" end="00:07:32.289" style="s2">I know Japan is concerned about it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.050" end="00:07:34.690" style="s2">it&#39;s happening around the world as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.289" end="00:07:36.580" style="s2">know my generation I grew up learning to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.690" end="00:07:39.370" style="s2">milk the cow was just a fuss growing up</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.580" end="00:07:45.880" style="s2">or planting a garden or harvesting all</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.370" end="00:07:49.150" style="s2">this aspects of recycling of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.880" end="00:07:52.900" style="s2">frugal was part of growing up in a post</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.150" end="00:07:56.020" style="s2">Second World War generation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.900" end="00:07:57.190" style="s2">that&#39;s being lost so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.020" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">lot of things at the moment it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.190" end="00:08:03.700" style="s2">happening which we I think are doing by</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:06.220" style="s2">teaching these bees we may be not even</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.700" end="00:08:08.650" style="s2">quite aware the contribution we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.220" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">making I think a historical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.650" end="00:08:13.419" style="s2">where do you see equivalence designer</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:16.810" style="s2">education go in the future when legacy</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.419" end="00:08:20.500" style="s2">if you sort of visioned a perfect future</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.810" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">for and the impulse spreading and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.500" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">would you holding I think we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.330" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">getting better and better at what we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:31.849" style="s2">doing at the moment and I think I could</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:34.699" style="s2">see this at this meeting with</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.849" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">here as I was involved in three programs</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.699" end="00:08:40.490" style="s2">last year and I could see personally the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">gaining experience in the growth and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.490" end="00:08:44.990" style="s2">improvement but and I think that will</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:47.540" style="s2">happen I think that the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.990" end="00:08:50.630" style="s2">of teachers will pick up from where we</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.540" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">have been going and will be more</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:56.259" style="s2">professional they maybe have sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:09:00.079" style="s2">backgrounds which are more suitable to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.259" end="00:09:04.579" style="s2">what we are doing there maybe are better</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.079" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">in teaching the material personally I</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.579" end="00:09:11.089" style="s2">see a great need to strengthen this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:14.440" style="s2">program but also to link the program and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.089" end="00:09:18.470" style="s2">what I will be working on for next year</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.440" end="00:09:21.529" style="s2">2019 my plan is to offer a four month</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.470" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">program which will be people called an</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.529" end="00:09:28.269" style="s2">apprenticeship it&#39;s basically a semester</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">term for many universities where</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.269" end="00:09:34.149" style="s2">students and I&#39;m looking only about</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:39.170" style="s2">eight students mixture of male female</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.149" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">north-south at crystal waters where they</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.170" end="00:09:44.329" style="s2">don&#39;t have to sort of leave off but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:47.259" style="s2">really gets interesting as we really can</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.329" end="00:09:50.449" style="s2">do the hands-on and we also can see and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.259" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">harvest the fruits of our Labor&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.449" end="00:09:55.550" style="s2">speak as we can do designs and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.889" style="s2">implementation we can plant and harvest</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.550" end="00:10:01.399" style="s2">in the gardens we can get into a routine</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.889" end="00:10:04.130" style="s2">where we can solve our differences if</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.399" end="00:10:07.639" style="s2">they are such as people can get involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.130" end="00:10:11.269" style="s2">in the day-to-day life of a community</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.639" end="00:10:14.149" style="s2">and see the weather the Dark Side of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.269" end="00:10:16.579" style="s2">Moon I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not all love peace</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.149" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">and happiness in a community and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.579" end="00:10:23.000" style="s2">people need to be aware of that too our</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:26.149" style="s2">setting can advise and enter into a life</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.000" end="00:10:31.630" style="s2">of being part of an eco village a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.149" end="00:10:34.120" style="s2">openness and how would you define design</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.630" end="00:10:36.550" style="s2">sort of a few if you speak a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:38.860" style="s2">the central role of design in both</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.550" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">permaculture and polish design education</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.860" end="00:10:45.430" style="s2">I would say the important point too may</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">be dishonest as it is a product of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.430" end="00:10:52.870" style="s2">observation so we will never take it on</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:55.990" style="s2">just on its own us design it is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.870" end="00:10:58.290" style="s2">outcome of observation and the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.990" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">loop where we can observe again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.290" end="00:11:05.350" style="s2">absorb really what we&#39;ve seen on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:09.480" style="s2">piece of land we want to design but</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.350" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">design itself I would say us place and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.480" end="00:11:18.519" style="s2">time as the typical example our use in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">permaculture people say no goats are bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.519" end="00:11:23.110" style="s2">they sits follow goats</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:25.420" style="s2">it sort of won&#39;t be first in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.110" end="00:11:28.509" style="s2">permaculture story and then we then look</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.420" end="00:11:30.220" style="s2">at it a bit deeper we find goats can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.509" end="00:11:31.870" style="s2">very very useful I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.220" end="00:11:33.759" style="s2">Switzerland and goats had that very</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.870" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">important part we play the nullcline</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.759" end="00:11:38.980" style="s2">regions but it is the place the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:41.889" style="s2">place for the goat at the right time so</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.980" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">for me it&#39;s placement and timing both as</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.889" end="00:11:47.949" style="s2">a product of observation the observation</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:49.540" style="s2">this example would include of the code</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.949" end="00:11:51.759" style="s2">is action not a grazing animal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.540" end="00:11:53.980" style="s2">surprising anything so what will the go</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.759" end="00:11:56.230" style="s2">to do in the place where I put them how</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.980" end="00:11:58.930" style="s2">long can they go period and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.230" end="00:12:00.939" style="s2">basically true also in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.930" end="00:12:04.209" style="s2">designing human settlements there we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.939" end="00:12:07.060" style="s2">need to be more aware of what people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.209" end="00:12:08.980" style="s2">needs are and behavior are and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.060" end="00:12:11.829" style="s2">think you know but really have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.980" end="00:12:15.939" style="s2">constantly be aware of that and in many</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.829" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">cases in the situation of land use of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.939" end="00:12:22.269" style="s2">human settlements occur images we find</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:26.709" style="s2">we know more about the carrying capacity</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.269" end="00:12:29.110" style="s2">of land for goats or cattle or sheep we</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.709" end="00:12:31.899" style="s2">know about the carrying capacity for our</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.110" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">streams has really been a lot of study</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.899" end="00:12:39.490" style="s2">there we really know then is the impact</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">of humans too great when do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.490" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">put a cap on the population we know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:49.899" style="s2">some cities have a field to me some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.180" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">the big cities the fail of internal</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.899" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">decayeth I remember I was in Mumbai and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:13:00.130" style="s2">walking from my place where I stayed</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:03.639" style="s2">where I was working walking past and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.130" end="00:13:07.269" style="s2">that all that remain lying on a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.639" end="00:13:09.939" style="s2">platform very was living in his last</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.269" end="00:13:12.339" style="s2">week and I&#39;ve watched him day after day</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.939" end="00:13:13.779" style="s2">dying on there and would leave some food</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.339" end="00:13:17.199" style="s2">or some water for him and other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.779" end="00:13:20.230" style="s2">exactly he was quite aware of that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.199" end="00:13:22.449" style="s2">the process which was happening but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">system the social structure did not</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.449" end="00:13:28.449" style="s2">exist anymore to really truly take care</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:32.259" style="s2">I think we have to be aware that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.449" end="00:13:34.779" style="s2">a size of a city even mighty modern seas</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.259" end="00:13:37.809" style="s2">that is likely to happen and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.779" end="00:13:41.230" style="s2">Iike villages are a good counterbalance</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.809" end="00:13:45.420" style="s2">to ease the burden on some of the cities</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.230" end="00:13:49.029" style="s2">okay and also I think make it maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.420" end="00:13:50.980" style="s2">acceptable and more exciting for young</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.029" end="00:13:53.529" style="s2">people to stay in religious like leer in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.980" end="00:13:57.639" style="s2">Thailand when I go out to Thai villages</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.529" end="00:14:00.130" style="s2">I find lots of older people my age and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.639" end="00:14:03.939" style="s2">very young people where are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.130" end="00:14:05.740" style="s2">which are 20 30 40 all there in Bangkok</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.939" end="00:14:08.949" style="s2">or there in Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.740" end="00:14:11.139" style="s2">varying hotels or in businesses where I</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.949" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">can earn a dollar they will not go back</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.139" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">to the farm to live there what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:19.779" style="s2">happen to villages so we need to find</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:20.439" style="s2">ways where you maybe should go and ask</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.779" end="00:14:23.079" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.439" end="00:14:25.569" style="s2">what would hold you back in the village</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.079" end="00:14:27.939" style="s2">what would make it possible for you to</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.939" end="00:14:33.730" style="s2">I think much better and while on the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.689" end="00:14:36.670" style="s2">hand there&#39;s the role of holding people</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.730" end="00:14:40.279" style="s2">back in in the villages do you also see</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.670" end="00:14:41.930" style="s2">that the ecology design education</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.279" end="00:14:44.779" style="s2">Killam has has something to take into</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.730" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">personal belief is that when we talk</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:18.649" style="s2">this is actually not true at all a very</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.059" end="00:15:44.930" style="s2">planning we have taken a suburban area a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.540" end="00:15:47.629" style="s2">fringe area of a city and we ripped it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">apart and they made it into light</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:57.170" style="s2">commercial educational areas and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.809" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">residential areas and so we flipped our</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.170" end="00:16:03.889" style="s2">lives into many parts and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.990" style="s2">fulfill our needs on a daily basis we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.889" end="00:16:09.470" style="s2">have to bring in the water bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.990" end="00:16:12.170" style="s2">food we have to pump out the device</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.470" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">which we creating there&#39;s no cycles</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.170" end="00:16:17.420" style="s2">anymore and we have to travel to and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:19.250" style="s2">from work this is huge shift every day</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.420" end="00:16:21.350" style="s2">and I think we should look at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.250" end="00:16:24.670" style="s2">European much smarter as we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.350" end="00:16:28.040" style="s2">together our needs a lot more I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.670" end="00:16:30.319" style="s2">planning that we could feed ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.040" end="00:16:32.899" style="s2">suburbia that we could make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.319" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">contribution we&#39;ve done tastes and other</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.899" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">people have done tests to which show</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:41.929" style="s2">that in a climate of Melbourne so a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:45.850" style="s2">temperate climate or a suburban climate</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.929" end="00:16:50.929" style="s2">like Brisbane it is possible to provide</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.850" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">most of the vegetable needs required for</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.929" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">him on four</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:57.880" style="s2">in square meters that is very intensive</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:17:00.930" style="s2">gardening multiple clocking but that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.880" end="00:17:05.230" style="s2">possible so now we can start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:07.150" style="s2">wasted spaces Virender roofs so there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.230" end="00:17:09.429" style="s2">actually possible this for food</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.150" end="00:17:11.260" style="s2">production I wouldn&#39;t say we should grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.429" end="00:17:13.809" style="s2">rice necessarily all that&#39;s done in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:16.419" style="s2">Japan in suburbia or we should grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.809" end="00:17:17.319" style="s2">large crops of potatoes or wheat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.419" end="00:17:19.539" style="s2">not what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.319" end="00:17:21.640" style="s2">but the vegetables our daily vegetable</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.539" end="00:17:23.890" style="s2">needs it&#39;s definitely possible to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.640" end="00:17:26.860" style="s2">that with in suburbia and it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.890" end="00:17:29.500" style="s2">with today&#39;s available technology to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.860" end="00:17:32.350" style="s2">absorb the human wastes of the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.500" end="00:17:35.950" style="s2">living there bidding the footprint of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.350" end="00:17:40.330" style="s2">that suburbia in parks and gardens and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.950" end="00:17:42.580" style="s2">urban forests and so on we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.330" end="00:17:45.010" style="s2">invent anything new to do that wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.580" end="00:17:46.059" style="s2">today&#39;s knowledge today&#39;s technology we</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.010" end="00:17:48.700" style="s2">could do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.059" end="00:17:50.020" style="s2">and in the process bring people closer</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.700" end="00:17:52.299" style="s2">closer together</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.020" end="00:17:54.309" style="s2">they&#39;ve been surveys done by Bill</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.299" end="00:17:56.440" style="s2">Metcalfe and others which show that a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.309" end="00:17:59.770" style="s2">very high popular percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.440" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">population would actually lie like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.770" end="00:18:07.210" style="s2">live close together with a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">to neighbors and but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.210" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">Nico village or suicide but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:16.289" style="s2">could create suburbia in something which</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">has all of our village flavor to it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.289" end="00:18:23.830" style="s2">qualities in a suburban environment and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:27.970" style="s2">how do you see the growing problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.830" end="00:18:29.890" style="s2">water scarcity be ameliorated by some of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.970" end="00:18:34.120" style="s2">the design approaches within eco village</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.890" end="00:18:39.549" style="s2">design are there ways that we can better</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.120" end="00:18:42.610" style="s2">preserve our waters and yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.549" end="00:18:45.309" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know where people see that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.610" end="00:18:48.580" style="s2">to that problem in my own house I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.309" end="00:18:51.580" style="s2">a roof area of about 250 square meters</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.580" end="00:18:53.799" style="s2">every time it rains one millimetre</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.580" end="00:18:56.770" style="s2">I collect 250 liters of water in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.799" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">rainwater tank now but I am in a rural</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.770" end="00:18:59.830" style="s2">area I can actually drink that water</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">it&#39;s clean</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.830" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">but if you live in a city and it&#39;s</p>
