<p begin="00:00:02.879" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">response to a patreon question that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:11.190" style="s2">submitted by a subscriber the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">asks is there an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.190" end="00:00:17.039" style="s2">explanation for the Fermi paradox or our</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">irrational species doom to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.039" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">themselves there&#39;s a problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:24.890" style="s2">concept of irrational species any</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">species that exists is in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.890" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">rational response to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">from which it has come now in our case</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:34.680" style="s2">our species has another way in which it</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">can be irrational which is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.680" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">conscious thoughts and those conscious</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">thoughts can be at odds with reality but</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:45.050" style="s2">it is really impossible to have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:48.629" style="s2">species persist without it being</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.050" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">sensible in some deep relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">the universe but that actually points to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">the answer to this question as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">which is it is quite possible for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">species to be in sync with its past</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">environment and incapable of surviving</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">in a future environment so the Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">paradox is really most likely about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">fact that if you reach a point at which</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.909" style="s2">you can potentially travel and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:24.259" style="s2">communicate across vast distances of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.909" end="00:01:27.080" style="s2">space you have inevitably discovered</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.259" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">technologies that are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.080" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">creating your undoing as a species now</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:38.270" style="s2">the question is do any species manage to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">create those technologies and then not</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.270" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">accidentally destroy themselves quickly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">thereafter my guess would be it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">possible to do especially if you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">aware enough of the problem that you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">name something like the Fermi paradox</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">which points to the hazard you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">don&#39;t need to get run over by a car to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">understand why it is that you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:07.650" style="s2">very careful walking by the curb you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">learn enough from the thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.650" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">or from other people&#39;s experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">having hit by having been hit by cars to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">learn to behave safely so a species that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2">could recognize the hazard of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">self-destruction could potentially put</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.740" end="00:02:28.710" style="s2">safeguards in place that would negate</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">the hazard of the technologies that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.710" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">had invented but my guess would be it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:39.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen very frequently that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">effect what makes populations wise is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.170" end="00:02:45.170" style="s2">repeated interactions with failure and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">the problem is failure is not an option</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.170" end="00:02:52.020" style="s2">once you have things like nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">weapons that can on leaf dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.020" end="00:02:59.490" style="s2">can end a species with one single error</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:03:03.630" style="s2">so for Humanity the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.490" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">for us to do is to recognize that even</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.630" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">if risks seem tolerable even if the risk</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">of a nuclear war occurring during any</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:19.739" style="s2">year seems to be one in a thousand or</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:22.770" style="s2">one in 10,000 that risk is still far too</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.739" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">high if our purpose is to survive in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.770" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">long term we have to find a way to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">the technologies that are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">destroying us under control in order for</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">our species to continue to persist deep</p>
