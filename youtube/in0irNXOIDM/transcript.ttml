<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">pain but what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">that you get everybody that&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">that&#39;s involved with it now becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">an evangelist</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">and an advocate of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">when it finally gets developed and hits</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">the streets</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">so my ideally i would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">everybody in the facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">have some kind of input may be trapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">by that software that adriel was talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">about where they put their input in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">and then it um it gets tracked and every</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">the programmers can comment on it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">other people can comment on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">and if it&#39;s easy to do and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">and urgent and important then it will</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">get done it&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">but important equals or height but</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a little lower and hard to do but</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">not important it just</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">drops off and you can see why so um</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">that is kind of like what i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">see happen over the next year</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">so basically um we talked about them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to mention some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">ideas an</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">app that an easy to use app</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">that gets adopted right away that allows</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">people and this is i think jubilee&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">words the need for a meta app that pulls</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">all the information about game b</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">products and companies into</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">into one simple app it can rate</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">um that are beneficial you can choose a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">feature set</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">that is important to you break those</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">values it shows you companies</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">based on that and shows you the overall</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">ratings as well um</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">i think jubilee mentioned this it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">be kind of like a cancel culture that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">actually works but gives you a road to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">redemption a company a road to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">redemption</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">so that you can see if a company is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">doing well is improving over time</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">has done well has improved over time</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">hi alejandra welcome how are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">hi nice to see you hi</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">um so um basically just</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">a a little bit of a recap so a meta app</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">that&#39;s easy to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">that would show people a list of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">that have done beneficial things</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">in the past and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">they have done in the past few months</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">are they trending up are they trending</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">down and you can see that as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">so because we have that information it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">will capture that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">so this and this came out of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">previous meetings</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">um providing a software module to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">companies so that they can begin the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">process of incorporating their companies</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">into this list and app so they can start</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">and then the the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">in this work group</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">or committee will then uh help to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">onboard that company</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">um and and track and verify that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">um it can be crowdsourced at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">uh but if if they&#39;re if they provide</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">enough hooks</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re easily verifiable then this</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">can grow when they can show the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">connections to other companies their</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">suppliers</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.840" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">and such uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">start with small local businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">they could grow to provide a platform to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">provide those businesses with a local</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">small companies will get priority and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">prominence on the app</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">and you can add things like products and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">ingredients lists later uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">bentley mentioned that you can buy these</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">ingredient lists so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">something that can be added later</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure who mentioned this but i</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">thought this was important how we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">make sure that only the data we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">share gets shared with only companies</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">we know won&#39;t use it for bad purposes i</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">that seemed like it was important i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">not sure how we&#39;d do that but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">be something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">is considered</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of green washing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">tendency now that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">that again is something that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">considered when you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">um how you&#39;re going to verify this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">how you&#39;re going to make sure those</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">ratings that you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">are you still valid</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">uh moderators to keep the bots out i</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">i thought that was important as well and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">so people want cheaper quality plus</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">metrics like companies from the good guy</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">there&#39;s one of the things that came up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">is that there were three or four really</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">really good companies that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">had this kind of intent but they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">used i never even heard of them until</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">um we did this uh the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">well what was the other one um b corp</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">i contacted them but they they just</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">really didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">much of a desire i seem to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:08.639" style="s2">with this so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">that fell off the wayside but other</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">companies i never heard of b corp before</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">i never heard a good guide and never</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">heard of other companies</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">a lot of these companies but why so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a big thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">we have to kind of figure out why</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">because we want this to be used we want</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">this to be the killer app we want this</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">to people to use the word for using it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">like google</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">i want to buy i want to make a purchase</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">i i&#39;m thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to use this app to just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">research and get the information right</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s big companies that buy other</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">so we want to know that too it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">be if that happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:49.840" style="s2">then this thing goes gray or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">like that and it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">rise to prominence until the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">stuff is filled up</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">um this was i thought this was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">gritty you need something that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">when someone is being a bastard</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">you recognize that language carrie so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">just uh you know something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">very simple very graphic</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">very intuitive that says this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">you know this is is just something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">is trending the wrong direction i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">going to point that out</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.120" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">radical transparency that&#39;s the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the model</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">companies get prominence and points for</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">providing radical transparency</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">um that&#39;s the idea may never get there</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s just the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">and the app is built to to grow with</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">plug-in capability for the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">for products</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">ingredients and contracts so at this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">stage it&#39;s the casting of the white net</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">still trying to gather and even know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">where we need input from i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">need input from people who are just</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">neophyte users programmers</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">people who are business people and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">people know</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">kind of where all the bodies are buried</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">and so ideally in two months</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">i would like to be able to know whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">this is viable or not to go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">and a year to come up with a workable</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">and a basic functioning app</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">so that is that is the idea two months</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">go or no go</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">12 months something</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">anyways i&#39;ll open it up</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">so i was just looking up i&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">go ahead oh so uh i was just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">the certified b</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">the b corporation that you mentioned i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">forgotten that was there</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">um and just to clarify that has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">to do with game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">uh b corporation in that context is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">benefit corporation in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">corporation settings but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">overlaps in a kind of way because</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to work for a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">world but i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know market if you&#39;d already</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">looked to see that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">they do actually do ratings on b</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">corporations at several different</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">uh levels have you seen that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">uh yeah i i love the idea of b</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">corp i um there&#39;s a few things</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">that when i contacted them i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">i really thought well if</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">if this if one of the key things they do</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">miscall the b corps thing that would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">fantastic and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">i i emailed them and i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">i wanted to to do that but they just</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">just seemed very</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">reluctant what was your feeling well i</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">haven&#39;t communicated with them i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">just asking whether you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">their rating system they have on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">site</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">uh adriel can you pull up my screen</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">so this is uh this is their rating for</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">greening</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">which is just the first company i saw on</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">their list so it&#39;s got a rating in 92.3</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">and then they have it broken down by</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">governance the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">worker rating a community rating</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">environment customers and then they rate</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">each section</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">um so that was interesting now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">that&#39;s not of course exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">um but it was a little closer than i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t checked on them in a year or so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">so they&#39;ve added a lot of features to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">their site so</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">i just wanted us to to be aware that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">that exists</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">um and then we could see whether we want</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">you know if the how is that overlap</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">enough that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">this initiative doesn&#39;t have to go much</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">further or does it change the initiative</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">to find a different niche</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">or other stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">one question i have about this out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">the gates is this u.s only</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">most likely it&#39;s from what i know a b</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">corp is a u.s thing most likely</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">b corp is global b corp is global</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">where do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">like this site is global because i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">that oh this company was actually in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">chile</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">the one that you were just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">which is interesting now is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">something that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">kept i guess is that close to what mark</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">was talking about where people have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">sort of sign up to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">audited and sort of they provide their</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">information in a questionnaire and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">that could summarize</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">a lot of stuff about b corps</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">um there&#39;s a b</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">corp is a company that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">that has applied to and been certified</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">by b lab which is a non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">and uh you have that the company has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">meet several pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">stringent criteria uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">triple bottom line criteria people</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">profit etc in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">certified and then they get an</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">independent audit</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">and they have to and they&#39;re audited</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">annually and they have to report</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">how they&#39;re doing so uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">the information becomes accessible on</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">on the b corp website as we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s one source of data</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">and now there&#39;s a there&#39;s a confusion</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">a b lab certified b corp</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">and a legally registered</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.639" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">public benefit corporation they&#39;re two</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">a a public benefit corporation also</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">referred to as b</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">corp which is what makes it confusing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">a type of legal entity</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">for all intents and purposes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">essentially the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">as a c corp except</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">it is exempt from the mandate</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">to maximize profits for shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">okay so uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s incorporated specifically to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">social enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">well it i think you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">it you just have to have a benefit</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">you can still maximize i mean you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">can still have that in the charter it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">just means you have to have something</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">is an addition to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think you&#39;re not profit</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">motivated some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">right but it&#39;s it&#39;s triple bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">so of course you can make a profit</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">but your shareholders can&#39;t sue you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">because you invested in the community</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">because right the problem with the c</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">corp</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">is that you know where you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">and not all companies that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">are public companies right</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">be private company with private</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">shareholders but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">if the company decides to invest in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">community project</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">some shareholder can say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">that money could have come to us</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">right as a as a dividend why are you</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">wasting that money it could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">a profit for for the shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">so the the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">registering as a public benefit</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">i think in washington they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">social purpose organizations</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">is that they&#39;re social enterprises and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">they&#39;re expressly</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">not designed exclusively to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">produce profits for shareholders so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">they&#39;re exempt from that liability</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">which enables them to be social</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">enterprises does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">yeah i wanna i wanna that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">that&#39;s just underlines something that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">critical is the confusion around this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s um we don&#39;t know anything about i</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t know anything about b corp i</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">anything about benefit corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s one of the things maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a would be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">part of the mandate of this initiative</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">make things like yeah you know get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">information out there and clear up clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">up all of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">because the c corp can become certified</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">by vlad</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">yes yeah yeah i i think i loved it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">tell me harrison when you first heard of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">beelab were you not impressed</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">did you not think that this could be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">force that could change the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">i i thought it was definitely going in</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.919" style="s2">the right direction because</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">it is essentially if you look at their</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.919" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">criteria what it takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">in fact i actually applied to become a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">corp at one point</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">with my social enterprise but what i</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">realized in doing it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">and the feedback i got from them was i</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">the bar is really quite high to get that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">certification and it&#39;s really designed</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">for enterprise level corporations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">not for</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">startups really um</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">and you know most of where the green</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">washing goes on</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">and the uh you know benefit</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">devoting uh profits to shareholders is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">primarily at the enterprise level</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">so you know you got a lot of people say</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">oh corporations are so bad you know we</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">got to get rid of corporations</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">well actually things that have like uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">a uh public trust like for example drug</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">where there&#39;s tremendous profits</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">that i i think that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">required by</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">law to become certified as b corp they</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">they can still be registered as a c corp</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">but if they&#39;re um certified a b</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">corp as well then that&#39;s when you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">the public transparency</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">and accountability as you can see on</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">your screen</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">so just looking from that um what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things that uh i see that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">are are really good but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">see a a drill down capability to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">how they came up with those cores or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">what um</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">how how they&#39;re doing over time or</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">um an ability to choose what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">to me so somebody else has come up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">that score</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s a few things missing from</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">there from</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">one of these b</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">cups how much do they actually charge</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">you for being registered</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">you less</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">right i remember reading that i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">going back to bentley&#39;s question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s the criteria originally i</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">uh we come up with some criteria that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">would would fit but it&#39;s not restricted</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">to just companies</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">within game b but the original</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">crowdsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">could be from the gay be the game b</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">facebook group members and that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">it looks like the prices start at a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">thousand dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">cap out roughly at 50 000 and then after</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">you do more than a billion annual sales</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">it says based on the size and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">of your business</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">yeah there you go</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">so a minimum of a thousand per year</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">just going back to criteria of who</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">what companies would be tracked</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">originally</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">from those discussions we came down to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">small companies so in my mind bentley it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">if if you thought a company could fit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">the bill you could put it forward and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">um some group would vet it</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">some internal group would vet it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">that&#39;s how i pictured it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">what did you what was your initial</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">criteria</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">for betting</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">well just i yeah just just based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">applicable but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">i i guess i was just anything that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">be considered omni-win a benefit</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">uh environmentally socially that type of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">thing where um</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">the the person you&#39;re not taking a huge</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">and they had it there too so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">becoming it&#39;s becoming a global movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">because they may vary as far as</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">requirements and reporting requirements</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">so i so yeah so i guess the question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">um yeah so b corp&#39;s probably the closest</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">is everyone on this call no one else is</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">aware of any other existing</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">initiatives that are doing what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">talking and i and i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">mark and sounds like harrison you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">done research</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">to determine that because that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">one of the first steps in a project is</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">don&#39;t well one one question is do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">want to include non-profits or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">uh i i imagine non-profits would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.840" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">preferred</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">well i um yeah i i don&#39;t know why you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">exclude them</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">originally i thought on a list</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">is there um yeah i guess so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">i was thinking at first would there be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">interest and even general interest in</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">seeing the non-profits but i guess there</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">i i originally thought there are several</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">non-profits that you know produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">products and services</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">or have spin-off companies oh okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">uh right that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">yeah i think profitabil profitedness is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">not a uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not a factor i mean something we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">want to show</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">but that&#39;s not a deciding factor unless</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">you&#39;d say that a non-profit would</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">get even more points because the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">the the the main initiative</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">or and i don&#39;t know mark this this idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">came out before you knew about game b</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">or is it in response to what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">learning in game b or is it unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;s always been there um okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">i um yeah both like 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">and i think everybody&#39;s had anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">who&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">gone to do business with somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">say i wish i knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">if if this this person or this company</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">had done you know trash in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">you know that&#39;s always been there i</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">think i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">had that yeah so we wouldn&#39;t i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">imagine we&#39;d exclude it and wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">have a requirement that you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">incorporated or requirement that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">you know anything i mean you could be</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">selling soaps out of your</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">out of your car</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">and you could potentially be included</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">i had a question about um we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">discussed before</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">that although game b corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">important ones that if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">the game a corporations in there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">hard to compare them</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">are you still looking to include all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">them or just the ones like</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">kind of like b corp does just the good</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">um um at first i wasn&#39;t thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">but you&#39;re right it would be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">compare and just crowdsource it because</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">if they&#39;re they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">non-transparent</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">but just crowdsource it and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">these are what the bottom feeders are</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">and if and if they want to raise on our</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">list well they can contact us and we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">connect with them</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">but this is what we know so i think i</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">not doing that initially because</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">if you have okay here are the good decks</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">right if you just have a list of here</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">are the good guys</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">and if you want to buy ethically or</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">invest ethically</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">these are the places to go then</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">the other companies who aren&#39;t on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">list are going to wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">maybe we should you know see about</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">getting on this list maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">change our ways you know it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">incentive whereas if you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">bad things about them you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">these are the bottom feeders or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">that can get into a lot of unnecessary</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">at the same time as a consumer if i go</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">there to use it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">and one company has a score one</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">company&#39;s not there i&#39;m not instantly</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">going to assume they&#39;re bad i&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">like oh i don&#39;t know so i can&#39;t compare</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">those two as opposed to if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">profile for both</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">one has a score of 90 and one has a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">score of four oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">all right they&#39;ve looked at this company</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">and i don&#39;t really want to do business</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">based on what i know</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">but i do agree that that opens up</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">potential legal issues with that company</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">liking their score and possibly suing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">alleviate it right would you be</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">including what people are investing</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">on where they&#39;re investing in what</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">they&#39;re doing because like i know all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">the companies who probably do good</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">well than that but they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">investment portfolios which</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">which involve like arms deals and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">like that so would you be kidding</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">with that company&#39;s investing money into</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">idea that&#39;s that&#39;s the ideal model</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">that might not be so ideally i would</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">like to see like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">and this is my infatuation with hollow</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">chain because i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of cool but it could it could</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">show all those connections everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">and it could come up and and show it to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">you to turn it around and see</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">everything and if if if it&#39;s money is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">going out somewhere and it&#39;s and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know about it then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">great the more gray a company has</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">um the less reliable and trust me you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">can put in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s it&#39;s important kerry to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">eventually have that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">may not have that in the beginning okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">i just want to have one question mark</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">about um you&#39;re talking about an app</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">so you you&#39;re talking about developing a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">an app for a smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">is that correct you&#39;re muted</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">yes yes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">my understanding and i&#39;m not a technical</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">guy but my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">first you develop something for an</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">iphone and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">once that&#39;s developed then you develop</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">something for</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">that is also usable on android</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">now that i wouldn&#39;t recommend that um</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">i&#39;m a developer um and and really</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re starting out you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">and you have a low if you have an app</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">that does not require any special</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">features for the phone</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re especially if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">starting out in a in a low</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">cost endeavor or startup or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">with without a lot of funding then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">develop an</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">app and a technology that can run on all</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">yeah yeah it so it&#39;d be a website and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;d be an app for iphone and android</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">there&#39;s several technologies you can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">and so when mark is saying app</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">you know the first version would</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">probably be a web</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">app so just on the web and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">could you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">create a shortcut on your phone and use</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">it on your phone like a built-in app and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">then if we have money</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">we would then deploy that to uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">android and iphone stores and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">microsoft store</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">because the reason i</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">ask is because um when i started my</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">online farmers market i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">first looking at well maybe i should</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">just create an app and when i got into</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">it was like oh man the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">curve and the amount of money necessary</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">to actually build</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">a smartphone app you know before you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">even know if you&#39;ve got market fit</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">is kind of ridiculous so you know after</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">spent wasting two years talking to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">programmers i found out you know what</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">i could build the damn ecommerce</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">platform myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">in woocommerce for a thousand bucks and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">i just weighed it in and did it myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">right yep and i told people</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">you know if they wanted it on their</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">smartphone well just you know drag the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">url</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">to the to your to your home screen and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">then you can come to us anytime just by</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">hitting the button</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">because it because the website is mobile</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">friendly</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">so that saved me about two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">thousand dollars in about five years of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">i&#39;m just to bring it up just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">and all those developers who told you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">that gave you that advice were</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">less than ethical</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">as an example of all this i brought up</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">the b-corp site on my phone</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s working just fine right so i</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">think that&#39;s sort of an example of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">starting with a website</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure that the site works fine on</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">iphones as well</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">um and then if i think too bad at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">point it&#39;s just if you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">access certain features of the phone</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">like you know the camera or gps or</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">you might start to get into oh okay now</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">we need an app but if all i&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">trying to define a company a website</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">should work fine</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">i just wanted to uh highlight we had</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">asked if anyone else knew of anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">like this this is not for businesses</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">necessarily but i&#39;m guessing it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">daniel</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">said charitynavigator.org helps you find</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">charities i was on there a bit trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">find the wii</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">charity because canada&#39;s had a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">controversy with them to see how they</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">scored but then it just brought up every</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">list of any</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">charity that has we in it so i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">evidence-based impact on the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">uh if you search effective altruists it</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">would come up a camera what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">and uh quite a few charities</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">um and some of them were quite touchy</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">mean but the public perception of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">is oh they&#39;re great they&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">so you won&#39;t see any of that listed on</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">any of the b</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">corps or any of the charity navigators</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">you know i mean because nobody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">rock the boat and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">you know call them out or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">know what i mean so that&#39;s all i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">about would crowdsourcing get around</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">do you think well well i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">it would because i&#39;m i think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">right if you&#39;re going down the chassis</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">route then you&#39;ve got all the forms and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">everything else you&#39;d have to fill in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got to jump to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">else&#39;s tune right</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">and even when you go down as i said once</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">you go down investors you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">basically do it do as they say</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">right because they&#39;ll be wanting money</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">back as well so</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">if if they want you to do something</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">unethical because you&#39;ve already took</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">the money off them</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to do that to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">now so your ass is theirs</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">you know i mean so that&#39;s why i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">thinking and maybe crowdsourcing would</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">be better</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">because then you&#39;d know it actually owns</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">you know be a collective or a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">co-op or something rather than sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">like having investors</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">i think that would well i&#39;d be more</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">happy with</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">sort of like collective co-op rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">investors or going down the charity</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">as well because i wouldn&#39;t i obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">oh you know i&#39;d never i&#39;d never touch</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">another charity with a barge pole in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">terms of support and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">you know like as you see these people on</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">the streets who collect money with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">tins</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">they call them chuggers in the uk right</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">and you see them on the street</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">collecting right</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">they&#39;re run by marketing companies who</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">basically say to the charity right</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">how much marketing how much you do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">want to earn this year</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">so they give them a total so anything up</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">over and above what what those</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">sugars on the street get goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">the marketing company</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">the charity doesn&#39;t even see that bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">but nobody knows about that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">nobody says fuck all ey</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s why i&#39;m kind of dubious about</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">the charity sector</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">and all that shit and to that extent</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">even the money that makes it to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">charity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">there&#39;s some charities that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">notoriously bad for spending like 90</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">of the money they raise on</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">administrative costs yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">mostly sort of like ceo salaries as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">yeah and bonuses yeah all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">they spend where i pulled up a list i</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say any company names just</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">in case but like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s one example that&#39;s apparently</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">like a knockoff of the make a wish</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">foundation where they spent 600 000</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">granting wishes in 2010 and spent 10</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">times on fundraisers</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">yeah so i i don&#39;t want to be part of any</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">charity thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">because as i said i&#39;ve seen the bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">from the inside well</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">this type of a project is great for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">because a lot of this is available in</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">numbers</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">like this list of you know the best and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">worries charities</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s based on stuff they have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">report and the fact that that you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">they&#39;re forced to report so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">go look and say</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">show me the worst charities if you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">to list charities on a site or like on</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">app like this you could probably fairly</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">easily figure out what the percentage</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">they spend on administrative costs and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">you know towards their actual goal</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">and then have that be a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">score for charities so you can say oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">that charity is great they spend you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">know 75</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">on their actual you know goal cool that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">that&#39;s fine all that one gives</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">95 to administrative costs and salaries</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">not so cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">so i just want to bring the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">back to mark&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">what would you like us to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">think about and crowdsource for for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">actually this uh i&#39;m still in the in the</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not too um</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">what is it i&#39;m not too bothered by</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">the direction it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s gone we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">gone down a rabbit hole as far as</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">charities have gone a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">it brings me back i&#39;m just wondering uh</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">a lot of this if we could get that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">filled plus the crowdsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">just the amount of horsepower that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">gone in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">to getting that information that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">talked about has been a good</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">demonstration of how</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">the app could have addressed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">you know there like we&#39;re six people or</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">eight</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">however many that have are</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">really concerned about how we spend and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">how we spend our money and and just</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">bothered by the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">malevolence that&#39;s out there you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">people that are that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">we we and we don&#39;t want to help them in</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">their tasks so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">uh again this is just showing me that so</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">i&#39;m willing to let this</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">kind of take whatever direction yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">if i may i&#39;ll just just some input on</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:35.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:38.800" style="s2">i think initially if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.920" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really clearly defined pain</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.800" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">yet anyway okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">but we have a sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s good for people</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">and planet</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">essentially okay as a minimum criteria</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">and the only publicly public places</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">where that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">intention is documented or tracked or</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">is with the b lab certified c corps</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">and those entities that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">legally registered as social enterprises</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">in the form of public benefit</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">or social purpose corporations and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">think you know rather than</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">making the project too initially</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:25.839" style="s2">and time consuming if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">something out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.839" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">my recommendation would be to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">those two things and get those get all</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">the data for that and then get some</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">feedback and do an</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">iterative process at that point an agile</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">um i guess i hear what you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">that that was something that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">thought initially too that i was excited</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">when i contacted b</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">lab i was like you know um</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">let&#39;s get something going um i want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">just trumpet it from the hills</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">and uh again they they just seem very</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">very reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">um you don&#39;t need their permission i</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">know i know</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">but their reluctance makes me think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">just gives me a little bit of pause</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">i i ben bentley had brought something up</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">because it just happened it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">bubbled up from the top and we circled</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">back to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">that it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">the trust thing is a big thing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">what we know and who we trust seems to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">the small local businesses and we all</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">seem to kind of want to give them</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">prominence and points and all the help</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">so i yeah i i would i would eventually i</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:45.520" style="s2">be corp and the benefit corporations on</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">there and i think that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.520" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">as well as the other sources where</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">go and check these things out but i</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">really i would really like to see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">local businesses that people think are</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">doing well</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">brought up to the floor i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">what that just put that out there</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">yeah that that makes sense my my only</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">other thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">one of the major benefits that i foresee</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">in an app like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">is to encourage the larger corporations</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">to start to get ethical yes i just i</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">just posted an article on facebook where</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">sued if they only</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">had that that corporation&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">legal responsibility is to make profit</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">for their owners</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">if they&#39;re a public</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">american corporation</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge mission in what you want</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">just by exposing that kind of crap</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">you know the companies that have a a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">public trust</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">like that and scaring</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">other profiteers and extractionists</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">from being caught in the same public</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">reputation trap</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">yeah yeah i mean that i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">a worthwhile purpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">yeah i think on that note something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">i find interesting i&#39;m not sure if your</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">plans</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">have any spot for this mark but to not</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">just talk about the companies but also</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">the people that make the decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">like if we know you know who&#39;s the owner</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">who&#39;s the board who like</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">that sort of thing because there&#39;s times</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">where a company might make terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">choices well a company</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">can&#39;t make choices people do and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">those people leave and go to a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">company and better people</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">join that company who should those</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">actions fall</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">in and it might be both it might say</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">well this company did that and even</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">though the people responsible left</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">that&#39;s still a part of their history but</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">also here&#39;s the people that voted for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">that action or to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">information is available</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">and now here&#39;s a company they&#39;re a part</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">of so in in the programming world</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">that that um that person is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">object that&#39;s connected to other objects</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">and but you can always trace</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">the past actions of that one object and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">then maybe you could see a history of</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">the objects that are um that are in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">influential positions in a company and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">just know the potential for disaster</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">just looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">all there yeah that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:15.359" style="s2">point because you&#39;ve got interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">directorates you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.359" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">companies that you know want to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">social engineering or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">they have these front groups that have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">really nice sounding social name but</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">you know they&#39;re up to no good so who</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">actually owns this</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">and what&#39;s the mother companies and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">know that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">that would be fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">sort of me starting with who the app is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">for and getting very focused on it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">whether it&#39;s for investing whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">um the person who&#39;s who is purchasing a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">product because most of us don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">about the company we decide we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">care about the company i&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">purchasing based on the company because</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">for that kind of thing then because i</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">think all of these are very big</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">ideas that we all want but where do you</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">mark</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">marking them and we&#39;re not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">game b whereas if we wanted we want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">bring</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">like harrison&#39;s actual project right of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">like the the online farmers market that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">would be focused on food and such</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">but like start with one and then it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">broadens out</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">which one do you want to start with and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">maybe this we&#39;re still casting a net but</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">which one kind of speaks to you more</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">i you know when when you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">there there&#39;s nothing stopping you from</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">uh having a list of products</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">and and their parent companies as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">and so you could you could have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">products on there and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">the companies that are related them and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">you can make your buying decision just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">based on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">you know if you have a database of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">you could easily have a database of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">majority of the most popular products</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">yeah so so it sounds like your your goal</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">is saying the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">the the user of the site the primary</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">user the target would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">the consumer the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">conscious consumer i think you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">uh social investors as well those two</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">publics</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">well you have to you have to have one</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:35.920" style="s2">target</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">and it has to be knit small and then you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.920" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">can have a second target</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">after that so yeah as a secondary target</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">you could do that but</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">more efficient to choose a specific uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">well i</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">like some of these smaller companies if</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one of your priorities</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">one of their biggest problems is getting</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.720" style="s2">funding and finding social impact</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.720" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s billions</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">of dollars out there for social</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">uh social impact but how does</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">you know how do they link up right well</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">if they&#39;re producing a product this can</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">serve this app could serve as</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">a place for social impact investors to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">see these little guys who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">great things and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">um you know funnel some funds to them if</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s one of your objectives</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">yeah i i think that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">if you start with those two objectives</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll double the cost of of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">and so i think you should pick one</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">mark your meeting</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">mark you&#39;re muted</p>

<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.559" style="s2">always actively looking for a way to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">find a company like i</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.920" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">still apparent</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">right but you still you would still be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">consumer of the financial product then</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">the financial product would choose the</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">i think start like focusing on consumers</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">one thing that can be distilled later on</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.599" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">but that also helps in the communication</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">and and feeling the the idea down the</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">i just wanna i just wanted to say uh if</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">the intention is to provide a place</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">where people can find</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">ethical companies that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">serve the purpose of both consumers and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">curious investors so you know focusing</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">focusing on consumers would be good but</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to list products then</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">you know you start duplicating</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">things like consumer reports and gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.640" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">all of that so that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.200" end="00:57:53.920" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">activity i mean you could have links you</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2">could pull it in pull the data in</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">on products but if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">actually do product evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a really big ask i just thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">of a third option</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">with what alejandra just shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:11.440" style="s2">that we as people are kind of products</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.440" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">that like when i&#39;m looking for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">to hire to do coding or to do marketing</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">if i&#39;m paying them i mean i&#39;d rather be</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">volunteer because i know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">passionate about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">but when i&#39;m looking to pay i want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">know i&#39;m looking for a game b</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">person even a game b electrician and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">game b plumber right</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">like that level could be somewhere to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">start i know it&#39;s not i just</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">wanted to throw that out there that if</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">you started there then it kind of leads</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">both into product and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">company because then it&#39;s like oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">this is a grouping of plumbers and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">grouping of that but that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">going i just wanted to share well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">close to what adriel brought up and um</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.960" end="00:58:55.920" style="s2">is is that um i suppose if if</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">decision makers and things like that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.920" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">objects in this in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">world then um it could track</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">some of that but maybe not down to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:11.280" style="s2">plumber level but</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">possibly i don&#39;t know um it it depends</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">on what is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">cost effective to design i guess but</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s yes i meant more starting there</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">that like as someone who when if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:23.440" style="s2">hiring people for game b</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">projects or game b anything then</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.440" end="00:59:26.880" style="s2">starting with people who</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">i mean how to but then it&#39;s it brings</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">everything else up like</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">how do i know you&#39;re a good person how</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">do i know your game be but okay i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">in your case the people are still</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">businesses because if it&#39;s a software</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">developer</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">you&#39;re paying them for it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a business</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">and they just have one product so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:46.319" style="s2">still not at the product level but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">small business when we say small</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.319" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">business that can go down to individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">contractors if we want to allow that</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:53.520" style="s2">um and yeah and i i kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.240" end="00:59:57.040" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.520" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">of starting out well i i mean i think if</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be open and crowdsourced</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">it needs to be opened and crowdsourced</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">and we then we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">moderation but</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">you know encouraging through the through</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">expanding a little bit but just just a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">little more not much</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;ve also narrowed</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:51.270" style="s2">uh so it and we never even talked about</p>

<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.480" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">we want to um have this spread like</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">wildfire</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">by empowering people to uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">be what kerry calls the private dicks</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">to go out and um investigate feel like</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">they&#39;re making a change</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">by contributing to this list and this</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">this growing database and crowdsourcing</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:31.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">and and having something you know you</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.599" end="01:01:35.280" style="s2">can train them</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">give them some basic training on on what</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.280" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">to look for</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:40.799" style="s2">and then you have a maybe a a network of</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">people that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">they can say hey i have this question</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">and then it just it just gets looked at</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:49.440" style="s2">right and so they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">something backing them up they can go</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.440" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">out there and actually you know be</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">heavyweights because not only are they</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">trained a little bit but they have this</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">this network of people 2 000 people at</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:05.280" style="s2">least in the background</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">going yeah i can weigh in on that i know</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">a little bit about that and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">anyways that&#39;s where you want to start</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">mark getting a group of people together</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">to create it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">can be right yeah yeah</p>
