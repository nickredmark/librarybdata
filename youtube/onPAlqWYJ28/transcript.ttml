<p begin="00:00:35.840" end="00:00:41.690" style="s2">priestly fatherly figure to him made a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.780" end="00:00:42.980" style="s2">lot of sense right so and he took the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.690" end="00:00:43.970" style="s2">struggle with the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:45.800" style="s2">warriors and the completely</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.970" end="00:00:48.380" style="s2">misunderstood him which meant that he</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.800" end="00:00:51.590" style="s2">would win he would definitely beat them</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.380" end="00:00:54.410" style="s2">right and and he&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.590" end="00:00:56.480" style="s2">pretentious I love Jordan to bits and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.410" end="00:00:57.910" style="s2">love him precisely because never - he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.450" end="00:01:12.530" style="s2">when you write a philosophical work you</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.760" end="00:01:15.770" style="s2">hope somebody else is gonna do the pop</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.530" end="00:01:19.010" style="s2">version of it oh you like do you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.770" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">Peterson is a pop version of you yes but</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.010" end="00:01:22.940" style="s2">he was there already before we published</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:25.220" style="s2">a book yeah okay we had published</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.940" end="00:01:27.530" style="s2">Cynthia was causing a stir and we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.220" end="00:01:29.060" style="s2">working I did is a liberal and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.530" end="00:01:30.650" style="s2">Jordan was dead I was just like what</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.060" end="00:01:32.750" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna write about and digital</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.650" end="00:01:35.150" style="s2">liberal the mass infantilization of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.750" end="00:01:37.130" style="s2">contemporary society you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.150" end="00:01:39.409" style="s2">horrors of the welfare state and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.130" end="00:01:41.330" style="s2">consumer society and the big mistake we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.409" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">made even Hitler installed and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.330" end="00:01:45.440" style="s2">assuming what what Eva was and all that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:47.180" style="s2">all the knowns as we had the last 100</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.440" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">years all the crap ideology we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.180" end="00:01:51.500" style="s2">deal with roll up and understand how</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">actually pathologically disoriented we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.500" end="00:01:58.250" style="s2">are all of the stuff yeah Jordan does</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:02:00.020" style="s2">that so well just as so well he points</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.250" end="00:02:02.060" style="s2">exactly the same good pointing and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.020" end="00:02:04.820" style="s2">gets all the guys going he gets them</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.060" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">going on their own personal journeys to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.820" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">what I understand what we&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:09.229" style="s2">when we really stay just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">just like yeah we&#39;re gonna be the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:13.080" style="s2">way you ever gonna be smaller there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:14.820" style="s2">fewer people</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.080" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">we gotta reach the people who who</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.820" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">interested in the real depth and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">widening where do we go next</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">you know and then Jordan can work with</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:25.710" style="s2">that later I hope when he&#39;s off the tour</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:27.270" style="s2">gets to have some time of his own when</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.710" end="00:02:28.650" style="s2">in northern Canada and the cabin and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.270" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">start thinking again because think</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.650" end="00:02:31.890" style="s2">Jordan can come back and really be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">brilliant philosopher - not just an</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.890" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">artist or a psychologist philosopher I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:40.500" style="s2">think he needs to take time off after</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">all this popularity is over done with as</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.500" end="00:02:45.960" style="s2">well yeah well because I always enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">listening to him but once you&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.960" end="00:02:52.170" style="s2">the his feel right you just just listen</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">to it in different ways and so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.170" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming he&#39;s becoming a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:03:03.630" style="s2">repetitive and that&#39;s normal because</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">he&#39;s like on tour all the time so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.630" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">like a it&#39;s like a rock band trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:09.990" style="s2">play the same yeah you can only say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">even if you get on Andrew Sweeney&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.990" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">podcast or do podcast under Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">that&#39;s better than any other part</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">because you&#39;ll never do well you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:19.740" style="s2">really get to the depth you can get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">in a text which is much more dense late</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.740" end="00:03:24.900" style="s2">so lectures podcast webcast can only get</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">to that for then you need to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.900" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">books and I tell all the guys South yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">you can read 12 rules for life it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:33.060" style="s2">best self probably ever written but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">the end of the day maps of meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.060" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">this really profound works that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">real of Jordan so you want you want the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">maps of meaning Jordan back after all</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">this is over and he could do great work</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">essentially to me it is Tessa there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">three types of storytelling in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:52.170" style="s2">original tribe there&#39;s the magical</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">storytelling which is that everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.170" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">returns to the same and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">remember from kindergarten that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">stories you tell the kids but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">the true and on a story about the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:04.650" style="s2">itself so it&#39;s both a story for grownups</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">and for kids but it&#39;s a story for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.650" end="00:04:09.989" style="s2">grown-ups to tell us you you are born</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.470" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">you you manage to fool yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.989" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">thinking you want to live you get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:16.020" style="s2">little you see the parents around you or</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:17.609" style="s2">the older people around you and your kid</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.020" end="00:04:19.080" style="s2">you want even one of them and one day</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.609" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">you become a grown-up you get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.080" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">respect and the autonomy that goes with</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">that then you get responsibility which</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">is wonderful you come back to the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:28.030" style="s2">you deliver on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">possibility do you give birth to a child</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.030" end="00:04:32.050" style="s2">or you bring back an animal you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">hunted but you do contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.050" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">tribe you get your own value then when</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">you get older you have less of an ego</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">and some you&#39;re more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.870" end="00:04:41.800" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna follow you and you start</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:44.200" style="s2">training the young you become a mentor</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.800" end="00:04:45.490" style="s2">one day you might even become an elderly</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.200" end="00:04:47.290" style="s2">if you&#39;re lucky enough because you lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.490" end="00:04:49.900" style="s2">a full life and your wisdom and your</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.290" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">smile and your warm eyes with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.900" end="00:04:55.300" style="s2">else yes and you just give back and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:57.010" style="s2">give back until you completely exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.300" end="00:04:58.780" style="s2">and you don&#39;t feel you have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.010" end="00:05:00.669" style="s2">give back in this new generation ready</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.780" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">take over even for you being an elderly</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.669" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you die and then you die</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:08.740" style="s2">happily yeah you don&#39;t really die having</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:11.590" style="s2">lived a whole life not a perfect whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.740" end="00:05:14.380" style="s2">this is you okay so this is the magical</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.590" end="00:05:16.540" style="s2">story Jordan does that really well the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.380" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">second story being told this difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.540" end="00:05:20.590" style="s2">between the two different stores that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:21.910" style="s2">are phallic remember I talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.590" end="00:05:22.540" style="s2">got the king and the priest and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.910" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">separate</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.540" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">yeah King in the song God won&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:28.990" style="s2">king and the rain God and you got the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">priest in the Sun go their separate keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.990" end="00:05:33.010" style="s2">Patrick is separate because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:35.350" style="s2">want the tyrant okay so one of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.010" end="00:05:36.970" style="s2">stands for truth that&#39;s what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.350" end="00:05:38.590" style="s2">tries did himself he&#39;s just that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.970" end="00:05:40.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a man always stand up and speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.590" end="00:05:42.940" style="s2">the truth with integrity and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.540" end="00:05:44.890" style="s2">courage yeah that&#39;s what the priest has</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.940" end="00:05:46.450" style="s2">to do the priest must speak the truth at</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.890" end="00:05:48.820" style="s2">all times otherwise he&#39;s useless as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.450" end="00:05:50.950" style="s2">brain that&#39;s his only masculine that is</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.389" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">do what I do is that I&#39;m a philosopher I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:35.290" style="s2">work on grand narratives I work on how</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:36.430" style="s2">you build them what is necessary how are</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:46.060" style="s2">is the kind of story in itself at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:47.500" style="s2">moment this is the factual story you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.060" end="00:10:48.940" style="s2">tell the soldiers to leave the tribe in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">the morning this system it&#39;s a logical</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.940" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">story it tells seven about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">we all must also now tell people they</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:56.199" style="s2">must not interfere and mix these two</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:11:00.579" style="s2">stories or they get totally confused too</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.199" end="00:11:03.459" style="s2">they lose completely so I rather work</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.579" end="00:11:05.190" style="s2">with young novelists hey young artists</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.459" end="00:11:06.420" style="s2">and inspire them because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.190" end="00:11:08.220" style="s2">do something different from what I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.420" end="00:11:10.080" style="s2">rather than just working young</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.220" end="00:11:12.390" style="s2">philosophers who just compliment my work</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.080" end="00:11:14.700" style="s2">and add something to it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.390" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">that makes sense right and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:17.820" style="s2">at the guys around Jordan and little</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.910" end="00:12:00.030" style="s2">is truthfully as the philosophers did</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.770" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what Jordan loved</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.030" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn he lost also he lost the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">Russian novelist because Russia is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:09.090" style="s2">culture where the novel was more true</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:10.650" style="s2">than philosophy oh yeah he says he says</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.090" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">it&#39;s more true than true right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.650" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">not a good novelist like that ecology is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:23.520" style="s2">compressed truth also hidden truth or it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:25.260" style="s2">catches the attention of way more people</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.520" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">than my damn philosophy books every</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.260" end="00:12:29.010" style="s2">world and I&#39;m highly respectful of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">novelist high respectful artist that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.010" end="00:12:32.520" style="s2">exactly why philosophers obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:34.530" style="s2">novelist and they&#39;re assessed with art</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.520" end="00:12:36.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t the one inspire aren&#39;t because art</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.530" end="00:12:40.350" style="s2">can reach more people in an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.630" end="00:12:42.930" style="s2">matter but belongs to be sets the rules</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.350" end="00:12:45.180" style="s2">so it seems like in the first half of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.930" end="00:12:46.380" style="s2">your life you&#39;re engaged in art and now</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.180" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the second half you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.380" end="00:12:51.210" style="s2">engaged in philosophy right well which</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">recipe but archetype you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.210" end="00:12:54.750" style="s2">secondary argument that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.010" end="00:12:55.970" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a Jungian thing right a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.750" end="00:12:58.680" style="s2">bit you know he said you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:13:00.960" style="s2">morning of your life where you eat you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.680" end="00:13:03.330" style="s2">experiment and you do wild things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.960" end="00:13:05.190" style="s2">you you you know you go in every</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.330" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">direction and then the last stop you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.190" end="00:13:10.589" style="s2">like you synthesize that you you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:12.990" style="s2">articulate what it all meant in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.589" end="00:13:14.730" style="s2">kind of a way and we all know that when</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.990" end="00:13:16.290" style="s2">we turn 40 we get a last chance to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">completely change direction in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.290" end="00:13:20.730" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:22.529" style="s2">we have two archetypes yeah well as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.730" end="00:13:24.060" style="s2">universal happens with people who turned</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.529" end="00:13:25.980" style="s2">40 everywhere and most cultures people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.060" end="00:13:28.170" style="s2">live beyond 40 probably lived until they</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.980" end="00:13:30.899" style="s2">were 70 there between 40 and 70 is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.170" end="00:13:33.990" style="s2">usually not make sick and die okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.899" end="00:13:35.790" style="s2">why are sudden switch in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.990" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">different direction that means the vast</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.790" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">majority people have to architects when</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:42.630" style="s2">you study college in Canada American you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">do a major and you do minor right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:47.880" style="s2">a clever way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2">the primary archetype is that which you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:57.240" style="s2">do with EES that still impresses other</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:13:57.990" style="s2">people yes those things you just do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.240" end="00:14:01.980" style="s2">it&#39;s easiest thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.990" end="00:14:04.260" style="s2">everybody else cuz Wow not for us no not</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.980" end="00:14:06.779" style="s2">for the rest of us no fucking women that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.260" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">well no no no no no you&#39;re a stud you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.779" end="00:14:10.920" style="s2">better than us really yeah primary</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">archetype okay reading books yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.920" end="00:14:13.980" style="s2">can&#39;t help myself I read books all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:16.260" style="s2">terms and what are you doing your spare</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.980" end="00:14:18.209" style="s2">time I pick up a book I pick up books Oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.260" end="00:14:20.010" style="s2">read read read read primary architect</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.209" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">easiest thing in the world for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.010" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">and then maybe I even write one one day</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:26.250" style="s2">but I absorbed text I love it yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">marking up for you Andrew you&#39;re great</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.250" end="00:14:30.389" style="s2">the microphone see great cameras you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:32.190" style="s2">got a warm curiosity of you also learned</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.389" end="00:14:34.050" style="s2">from the very beginning meaning having</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.190" end="00:14:35.970" style="s2">conversation we use a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.050" end="00:14:39.449" style="s2">primary archetype you&#39;re the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.970" end="00:14:41.010" style="s2">modern medium columnist journalist and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.449" end="00:14:42.630" style="s2">whatever that medium expands you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.010" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">probably do well with it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.630" end="00:14:48.360" style="s2">your primary archetype you do such ease</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:51.060" style="s2">hmm okay secondary archetype knows I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.360" end="00:14:54.990" style="s2">not sure if I agree with that but did I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.060" end="00:14:57.389" style="s2">do you know video swing yeah okay you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.990" end="00:14:59.850" style="s2">brilliant okay so second archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.389" end="00:15:02.040" style="s2">that what you can do but takes more of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.850" end="00:15:05.779" style="s2">an effort and it often has some more</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.040" end="00:15:07.589" style="s2">theatrical fields hooked mm-hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.779" end="00:15:09.569" style="s2">secondary archetype is something is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.589" end="00:15:12.029" style="s2">useful because the guy who asked the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.569" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">primary archetype might die and we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.029" end="00:15:15.480" style="s2">somebody to fill his role we take</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:16.649" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s the second archetype</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.480" end="00:15:18.269" style="s2">could put him in the church their</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.649" end="00:15:19.829" style="s2">secondary archetype is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.269" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">communicating because it means you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.829" end="00:15:25.170" style="s2">understand the guys that have that as</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:26.970" style="s2">their first architect don&#39;t example you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.170" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">can be a woman in a room for the men but</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:29.370" style="s2">you can be the woman who can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:31.800" style="s2">with the men are up to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.370" end="00:15:35.430" style="s2">- the women successfully we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.800" end="00:15:37.770" style="s2">the gay guy who gets along well with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.430" end="00:15:39.990" style="s2">women and you can explain to the men for</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.770" end="00:15:45.270" style="s2">example what the women are up to women</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.990" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">are up to you&#39;re not you are a man</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.270" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not a woman but precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">you&#39;re gay and you see the world through</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:54.360" style="s2">women size you can successfully transfer</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:57.840" style="s2">that is knowledge to the tribe and to us</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.360" end="00:16:00.990" style="s2">- okay so second our archetype is often</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.840" end="00:16:04.410" style="s2">communicated has a theatrical quality to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.990" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">it but if you&#39;re lucky in life you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.410" end="00:16:10.020" style="s2">probably get to explore both your</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:14.490" style="s2">primary and your secondary archetype you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.020" end="00:16:17.280" style="s2">can do them in any order so um so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.490" end="00:16:18.660" style="s2">need music between 23 and on til six</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.280" end="00:16:21.090" style="s2">years ago until it was 52</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.660" end="00:16:23.370" style="s2">that&#39;s your secondary archetype that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.090" end="00:16:24.900" style="s2">I started my secondary archetype knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.370" end="00:16:29.070" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t do philosoph until I was at</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.900" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">least 40 years old so I did music for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.070" end="00:16:33.750" style="s2">years and by doing my second archetype</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">and becoming a successful music producer</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.750" end="00:16:39.540" style="s2">and artists and making music I learned</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:39.870" style="s2">popular culture I learned the world we</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.540" end="00:16:41.970" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.870" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">I learned media I learned mass medium</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.970" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">did it all the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">two and I know how hard it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:49.020" style="s2">good artist I know how hard it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:51.030" style="s2">successful artist I&#39;m highest respect</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.020" end="00:16:52.980" style="s2">for artists I love art I love music I</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.030" end="00:16:54.780" style="s2">love literature I love all the different</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.980" end="00:16:58.260" style="s2">fields of art I even did theater myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.780" end="00:17:00.090" style="s2">okay love them to bits yeah when I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.260" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">39 I got the chance to become a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.090" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">philosopher wrote my first book and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.220" end="00:17:07.290" style="s2">tell you what he was kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:10.110" style="s2">understand first then I got it this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.290" end="00:17:13.650" style="s2">my real element huh</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.110" end="00:17:16.320" style="s2">this is where I shine this is abstract</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.650" end="00:17:20.760" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s my thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.320" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">release that god I&#39;m lucky I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.760" end="00:17:25.050" style="s2">fucking lucky I had great parents great</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:26.760" style="s2">upbringing and self-confidence and had</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.050" end="00:17:29.460" style="s2">these two talents when I was seven years</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.760" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">old my boys from one side was rock stars</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.460" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">the other satis philosophers had beards</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:39.540" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a rare coming together of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:41.910" style="s2">two archetypes like it&#39;s not often that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.540" end="00:17:46.490" style="s2">the the rock star is also a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.910" end="00:17:46.490" style="s2">you know they should be more often I</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:53.370" style="s2">need to vogner is the combo is the comma</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.760" end="00:17:54.840" style="s2">again so so no a lot for most of it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.370" end="00:17:56.550" style="s2">art form in itself so the tertiary art</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.840" end="00:18:00.390" style="s2">form is the opposite of poetry it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.550" end="00:18:02.190" style="s2">literary art form so so so that sued my</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.390" end="00:18:04.680" style="s2">mind and and I&#39;d be honest with you this</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:06.210" style="s2">is dirty secret okay I&#39;m not really good</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.680" end="00:18:10.140" style="s2">at anything else besides the two things</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.210" end="00:18:11.850" style="s2">you know my job&#39;s nothing I understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.140" end="00:18:13.800" style="s2">that he&#39;s functional got a cleaning lady</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.850" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">coming over didn&#39;t care me I love her</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.670" end="00:18:31.530" style="s2">by yeah outside of those other passions</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.230" end="00:18:33.420" style="s2">that I have you know I&#39;m involved with</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.530" end="00:18:35.430" style="s2">the men&#39;s movement in Europe and we work</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.420" end="00:18:37.020" style="s2">in your 14 countries and our common</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.430" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">friend David foolery does the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.020" end="00:18:41.490" style="s2">in the UK we rebel wisdom we Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:42.630" style="s2">with our network here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.490" end="00:18:45.570" style="s2">incredibly rewarding to work with these</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.630" end="00:18:47.250" style="s2">young men you usually found us through</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.570" end="00:18:49.140" style="s2">Jordan Peter so they may be heard me and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.250" end="00:18:51.270" style="s2">a podcast some worth suddenly they join</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.140" end="00:18:53.310" style="s2">the movement in the ring and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.270" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">the guys archetypes is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.310" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">rewarding teaching them the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:00.930" style="s2">archetype second archetype and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">original archetypes and compare them</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.930" end="00:19:05.190" style="s2">with possible modern archetypes right</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:07.320" style="s2">now we&#39;re developing modern archetypes a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.190" end="00:19:09.720" style="s2">there might be professions but may also</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.320" end="00:19:14.270" style="s2">be other meaningful purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.720" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">purposeful things that men do so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.270" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">what we&#39;re aiming at is to give each guy</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:23.430" style="s2">an archetype that works for him mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:25.320" style="s2">and hopefully give him some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.430" end="00:19:27.420" style="s2">contributing role that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">great educational project doesn&#39;t it I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.420" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">mean and they have to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:32.670" style="s2">themselves we don&#39;t know the map modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.380" end="00:19:36.420" style="s2">archetypes yeah we told him we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.670" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">know the answers no you have to develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.420" end="00:19:41.580" style="s2">this yourself you have to work on it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:43.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if you&#39;re gonna find an</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.580" end="00:19:45.870" style="s2">archetype that suits you that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.350" end="00:19:49.890" style="s2">a contributed role and we know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.870" end="00:19:52.290" style="s2">that really that excites me that idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.890" end="00:19:54.510" style="s2">because you know I&#39;m sure and I see all</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.290" end="00:19:56.610" style="s2">these kids you know all the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.510" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have a they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.610" end="00:20:00.030" style="s2">what their fucking role is they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.310" style="s2">bloody lost it&#39;s just unbelievable right</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.030" end="00:20:04.800" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so so as if they had if they</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.310" end="00:20:06.690" style="s2">had archetypes to work with and if they</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.800" end="00:20:09.170" style="s2">could be conscious of that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.690" end="00:20:11.640" style="s2">that would be real education wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.170" end="00:20:13.530" style="s2">well it&#39;s all called tribal mapping</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.640" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m working with a camera to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.530" end="00:20:16.620" style="s2">Liberto coming out of it that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:18.810" style="s2">the big thing coming out of this book</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.620" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">we&#39;re essentially formulating a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.810" end="00:20:23.070" style="s2">new way of doing anthropology called</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:25.470" style="s2">tribal anthropology based on data on</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.070" end="00:20:27.240" style="s2">facts and we&#39;ll be discoveries that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.470" end="00:20:29.340" style="s2">got the inner circuit dominated by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.240" end="00:20:31.530" style="s2">women we got the outer circuit dominated</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.340" end="00:20:33.780" style="s2">by the men it&#39;s a metric and it Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.530" end="00:20:35.220" style="s2">II for lack of better words and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.780" end="00:20:37.050" style="s2">they&#39;re equal and they have different</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.220" end="00:20:39.480" style="s2">responsibilities and one of them pushes</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.050" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">and one of them pulls okay it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.480" end="00:20:43.740" style="s2">some and they&#39;ve got androgynous in</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:46.650" style="s2">between we need them too yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.740" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">problem is have got a lot of guys who we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.650" end="00:20:51.480" style="s2">don&#39;t automatically find roles for today</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.420" end="00:20:53.370" style="s2">and this is the honest brutal truth of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.480" end="00:20:55.620" style="s2">the men&#39;s movement today we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.370" end="00:20:57.570" style="s2">guarantee that we gonna find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.620" end="00:21:00.270" style="s2">contributed role for you as young men</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.570" end="00:21:02.580" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t find it yourself even</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.270" end="00:21:03.960" style="s2">with their help you&#39;re probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.580" end="00:21:05.670" style="s2">blow up and kill yourself at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.960" end="00:21:09.150" style="s2">the day cuz they don&#39;t men do if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.670" end="00:21:10.980" style="s2">don&#39;t find purpose yeah at best you find</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.150" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">a really dominant woman who wants a toy</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.980" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">boy yeah and she can have the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:20.010" style="s2">you can sort of say it along with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:21.630" style="s2">that&#39;s being assistant to a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.010" end="00:21:24.270" style="s2">woman could be the only option you got</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.630" end="00:21:27.930" style="s2">laughs let&#39;s do it that from God said</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.270" end="00:21:30.690" style="s2">find some kind of role on the overall</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.930" end="00:21:32.670" style="s2">tribal map of contemporary society and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.690" end="00:21:34.410" style="s2">your life&#39;s gonna be full with purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.670" end="00:21:36.660" style="s2">and meaning and you&#39;ll be happy if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.410" end="00:21:38.520" style="s2">don&#39;t find it we know guys when they</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">become redundant they start drinking and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.520" end="00:21:45.990" style="s2">they hang themselves yeah and one sign</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:48.590" style="s2">that there&#39;s a crisis in masculinity is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.990" end="00:21:49.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna have a huge male</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.590" end="00:21:53.190" style="s2">bipolarity</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.920" end="00:21:53.820" style="s2">epidemic over the next 10 years watch</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.190" end="00:21:56.580" style="s2">out for that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.820" end="00:22:00.300" style="s2">are we already there I mean yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.580" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">ready there yeah the best young man I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.300" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">work with all come to me and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:06.900" style="s2">already have the diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:09.300" style="s2">and I tell them you you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.900" end="00:22:11.460" style="s2">sick at all it&#39;s just a healthy reaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.300" end="00:22:13.860" style="s2">to a very unhealthy society and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.460" end="00:22:15.810" style="s2">pathological society where men in their</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.860" end="00:22:17.430" style="s2">masculinity are not being appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.810" end="00:22:22.800" style="s2">and while the society is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.430" end="00:22:24.180" style="s2">castrate you and for children you need</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.800" end="00:22:26.760" style="s2">to get out of that quickly you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.180" end="00:22:28.710" style="s2">find your masculinity spend more time in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.760" end="00:22:30.780" style="s2">nature and this is the opposite message</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.710" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s receiving isn&#39;t it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.780" end="00:22:35.580" style="s2">like it&#39;s a precise opposite that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:38.670" style="s2">I think yeah that&#39;s the conclusion I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.580" end="00:22:41.340" style="s2">came to being a you know sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.670" end="00:22:43.170" style="s2">new-age guy right it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.340" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s like it&#39;s that&#39;s its that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.170" end="00:22:47.940" style="s2">that&#39;s all a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:49.800" style="s2">yeah first advice I give these guys that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:51.720" style="s2">get out in nature build to tend</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.800" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">somewhere and hopefully live in Canada</p>
