<p begin="00:00:05.370" end="00:00:09.530" style="s2">episode of conversations with Tom I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">here with Daniel Shmack Tim burger and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.530" end="00:00:14.580" style="s2">dude you were the guy that showed up on</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:16.980" style="s2">my feed when I started researching the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.580" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">end of the world which is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">fascinating thing to become known for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">and I&#39;m super curious how did you you</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:25.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve touched so many different things</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">from the neuro hacker hacker collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">and self optimization and actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">creating businesses how did you end up</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">getting so deep into civilizations and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">how they fall apart what a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:39.809" style="s2">civilization is and how to improve</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:41.430" style="s2">things in our world I would say was my</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.809" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">interest since I was young and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.430" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">the center line so how to improve how</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">young are we talking while I was very</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:49.860" style="s2">fortunate to be homeschooled growing up</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">and homeschooled in a way that&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.860" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">to what people would call unschooling</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">now or I didn&#39;t have a fixed curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">so I got to study what I wanted and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">seeing the things that seemed like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">biggest problems in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">finding out why are these things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">this was actually what got to be my</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">curriculum so very now are were you</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">taught by your parents or did they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">give you access to actual teachers my</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">parents facilitated and sometimes I&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">to a public school or a private school</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">for a while but they were very actively</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">engaged in how I was processing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">information and then other times finding</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">tutors and other times just working with</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">books it was before internet so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">couldn&#39;t Wikipedia things but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">certainly use books and encyclopedias</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">and and fortunately what was their logic</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.670" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">did they not like school they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">think it was going to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">education what was the reasoning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">they they were kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">philosophers intuitively and had the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">sense that kids ask lots of questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">they have a deep curiosity in school</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">mostly doesn&#39;t facilitate their</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">questions and so when the kid asks why</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">is the sky blue and why is fire hot and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">what our emotions and whatever questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">they ask they&#39;re actually very deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">questions that if you want to address</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">why is the sky blue</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">there&#39;s atmospheric science there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">understanding the wavelengths of light</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">there&#39;s understanding the nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">solar system and astronomy and what a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">Sun is and then there&#39;s the neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:12.450" style="s2">and optics and eyes and there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">lot that goes into it that naturally</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.450" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">starts to unfold</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">that helps people understand a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">topics and also an interconnected rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">than fragmented way if you follow the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">curiosity but most parents and also most</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">teachers don&#39;t know how to answer those</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">things and so then I was gonna ask how</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">did your parents answer that like if my</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">kids ask me and now that I have kids</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">keep mind but if my kids were to ask me</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">a question that I didn&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:36.540" style="s2">to I&#39;d be like yeah let&#39;s get you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:37.410" style="s2">public school real fast because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.540" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">want to keep answering these questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.410" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">so did one of your parents stay home</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:44.850" style="s2">yeah both of them worked to work from</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:49.020" style="s2">home as much as they could be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.850" end="00:02:51.030" style="s2">available and if they didn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.020" end="00:02:53.820" style="s2">answer then it was let&#39;s go see how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.030" end="00:02:55.710" style="s2">figure that out and so that would be you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.820" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">know going to the library and pulling</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.710" end="00:03:01.140" style="s2">out cards to find the right book pulling</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">up encyclopedias also something even</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">better was them asking me why do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">think it might be how do you think it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:10.020" style="s2">might be so my answer was not instantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">just defer to outside authority was to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:14.460" style="s2">take the interest and facilitate my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">thinking on it but then to not just stay</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.460" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">there because the answer I come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:20.550" style="s2">might be totally gibberish but to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">investigate so it was facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.550" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">interest and facilitating the process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">learning how to deepen the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">deepen the interest as it goes and of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.520" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">course as you learn some things you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">become aware of how much other adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:34.800" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s interesting you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">is and so if you do that and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.800" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">force the kid to focus on and memorize</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">stuff with fear of punishment that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:41.340" style="s2">have no interest in then you don&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:43.080" style="s2">their interest in life and you actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.340" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">facilitate deepened interest and people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.080" end="00:03:46.650" style="s2">tend to become good at things they</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">really care about that yeah that is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.650" end="00:03:52.020" style="s2">powerful thing when I think about part</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:03:54.030" style="s2">of getting good is building desire and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.020" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">if you can capitalize on something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.030" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">you&#39;re already on fire for and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">heard you talk about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">perspective of how you create that next</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">civilization you likened it to an iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:06.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like you don&#39;t have to convince</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">people to get excited about technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.570" end="00:04:10.380" style="s2">like it works and it brings some benefit</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">to your life and so people just adopt</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.380" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">things that they&#39;re really into I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">super curious oh you I think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">brother right or by coincidence there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">a guy on the board of one of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">companies with the exact same last name</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">is it just the two of you or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">more so what&#39;s the age difference three</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">years younger</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">so how did your parents handle that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.290" style="s2">he just sort of forced to come up to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:35.760" style="s2">your level did they split it up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.290" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">talking to one of you at one time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.760" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">the other another like I said they had</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:45.480" style="s2">kind of intuitions about things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">were wrong with society that related to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.480" end="00:04:49.290" style="s2">how we developed humans and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">was a sense of how to do education</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.290" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">differently how to do parenting happy</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">family differently but it was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:56.700" style="s2">experimental they actually called our</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">family guinea pig for their four of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:05:01.980" style="s2">and was an experiment and it didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">the benefit of studying Montessori and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.980" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">Waldorf and lots of other systems that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:07.800" style="s2">had figured some things out so there</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">were a lot of mistakes that could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.800" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">been prevented but they were also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:15.450" style="s2">benefit of they were in their own kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">of authentic inquiry and interest it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.450" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">happened that my learning style innately</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">worked with what my parents knew how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">do better than my brothers did and so he</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.280" style="s2">had a bit of a rougher go because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:28.169" style="s2">think they expected his path of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.280" end="00:05:29.790" style="s2">more similar to mine and it took a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.169" end="00:05:31.470" style="s2">little while for them to figure out that</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.470" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">and learning style</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.490" end="00:05:36.930" style="s2">he ended up excelling at entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:39.479" style="s2">ISM and political activism and things</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.930" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">that were not my areas of focus once you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.479" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">kind of figure that out do you have kids</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:46.110" style="s2">and don&#39;t so that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.070" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">interesting to see like how you handle</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.110" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">that have you given a thought to how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:52.380" style="s2">way that you came up and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.600" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t crushed out of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.380" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">could be systematized it could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.600" end="00:06:00.060" style="s2">something that could be rolled out about</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">that of course so what is that in terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.060" end="00:06:04.680" style="s2">of the ideal school system what does</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">that look like I think it&#39;s less to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.680" end="00:06:08.100" style="s2">think about it as an ideal school system</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">and as a civilization because by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.100" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">time the kid goes to school they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">already been profoundly imprinted right</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">by the time they&#39;re 5 or 6 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">they&#39;re going to 1st grade or</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:20.820" style="s2">kindergarten or wherever it is they</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">start they&#39;ve already fully learned the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.820" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">language in which they think and all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.710" end="00:06:26.580" style="s2">the ways that that language predisposes</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">patterns of thought they&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.580" end="00:06:34.290" style="s2">learned that the beginning of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:38.090" style="s2">dispositions and social values and lots</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.290" end="00:06:40.380" style="s2">of things and then obviously if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.090" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">educational system has to prepare kids</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.380" end="00:06:43.830" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:45.720" style="s2">workforce so we think about economics as</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.830" end="00:06:47.340" style="s2">it is then it has to do certain things</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.720" end="00:06:48.840" style="s2">that are not necessarily what would make</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.340" end="00:06:51.240" style="s2">them the healthiest happiest people if</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.840" end="00:06:52.530" style="s2">it&#39;s preparing them for a workforce as</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">the workforce changes through</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.530" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">technological automation and peak</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:01.110" style="s2">resource issues of the planet and AI</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:04.710" style="s2">automation and other things like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.110" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">obviously the role of education gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.710" end="00:07:09.629" style="s2">completely recontextualized so instead</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:12.360" style="s2">if you were to ask how would we redesign</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.629" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">civilization from scratch that included</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">the thing we call education but also we</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">mostly evolved in small bands and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">villages where we didn&#39;t just have two</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:23.219" style="s2">parents that were influencing us we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">a whole crew of people that we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.219" end="00:07:28.110" style="s2">pretty deep connections with sub Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:32.490" style="s2">kind of connections is even the nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.620" end="00:07:44.580" style="s2">via online social media platforms like</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.659" end="00:07:46.770" style="s2">is that how what does that do to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:49.469" style="s2">humans so this question of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.770" end="00:07:51.810" style="s2">design we build environments whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.469" end="00:07:53.340" style="s2">it&#39;s schools or economic systems in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.810" end="00:07:58.500" style="s2">nature of the incentive of economics</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.340" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">right as long as my ability to as long</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.500" end="00:08:02.039" style="s2">as the forest I go and enjoy the forest</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:03.479" style="s2">gives me no economic advantage but if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.039" end="00:08:05.310" style="s2">cut it down and commoditize it it gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.479" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">me a lot of economic advantage the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.310" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">economic system itself the perverse</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">incentive in the economic system is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:12.509" style="s2">conditioning value systems and people</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:13.979" style="s2">and whoever does better at getting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.509" end="00:08:15.659" style="s2">value systems that go along with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.979" end="00:08:17.879" style="s2">economic incentive system will end up</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.659" end="00:08:19.469" style="s2">getting more power within the system and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.879" end="00:08:21.060" style="s2">thus continuing to evolve the system in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.469" end="00:08:22.650" style="s2">the direction that benefits them and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.060" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">other people do well with it so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.650" end="00:08:27.740" style="s2">think about let me ask you so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:30.029" style="s2">make sense of the world view so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.740" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">everything that gets designed has a goal</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.029" end="00:08:34.919" style="s2">in mind so when you first started</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:37.769" style="s2">talking I thought that your punchline is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.919" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">going to be sort of happiness health of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.769" end="00:08:42.839" style="s2">the individual is that accurate or is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.890" end="00:08:46.310" style="s2">more the perpetuation of the species is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.839" end="00:08:49.970" style="s2">your if you had to say a highest value</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:54.570" style="s2">would it be that a happy and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.970" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">populace that you know like imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.570" end="00:09:00.269" style="s2">the movie was a children of men where</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.769" style="s2">there are no more kids and so population</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.269" end="00:09:02.940" style="s2">is basically the world&#39;s just ending</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.769" end="00:09:04.949" style="s2">because they&#39;re not able to procreate</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.940" end="00:09:06.449" style="s2">anymore but imagine that but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.949" end="00:09:08.040" style="s2">everybody was having a great time right</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.449" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">until the moment they died or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.040" end="00:09:13.620" style="s2">civilization where people are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:15.540" style="s2">exactly loving life but we find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.620" end="00:09:17.339" style="s2">get in balance with resources and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.540" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">able to go on and on and on which of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.339" end="00:09:23.610" style="s2">those to you is better I think you set</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:27.209" style="s2">it up to make it obvious that those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.610" end="00:09:30.709" style="s2">both gibberish desires that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.209" end="00:09:33.480" style="s2">civilization that is in an enduring hell</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.709" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">like well I won&#39;t go that far I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.480" end="00:09:37.380" style="s2">trying to find the perfect way to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:39.209" style="s2">question where I can find out if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.380" end="00:09:42.120" style="s2">more meaningful to you to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.209" end="00:09:45.569" style="s2">continue on and so because I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.120" end="00:09:47.790" style="s2">for what to optimize for and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.569" end="00:09:50.370" style="s2">optimize for continuation you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.790" end="00:09:51.930" style="s2">optimize for happiness you obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.370" end="00:09:54.540" style="s2">would assume want to do both but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.930" end="00:09:57.029" style="s2">trying to I find it it is very edifying</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.540" end="00:09:58.889" style="s2">when you force people to force rank</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.029" end="00:10:02.519" style="s2">things so that you can&#39;t have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.889" end="00:10:04.050" style="s2">two number ones because I I now have</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.519" end="00:10:06.389" style="s2">spent enough time in your world and sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.050" end="00:10:08.069" style="s2">of where you go I know sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.389" end="00:10:10.949" style="s2">ending points of some of the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.069" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">but I&#39;m super curious as to what is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.949" end="00:10:16.110" style="s2">the big driver for you in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.470" end="00:10:19.550" style="s2">you think about waking up in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.110" end="00:10:22.050" style="s2">and constructing a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">optimization theory itself is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.050" end="00:10:27.089" style="s2">underlying problems this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">super important to indulge me a moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.089" end="00:10:31.589" style="s2">here yeah if we do the thing you call</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:33.899" style="s2">stack ranking which is an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.589" end="00:10:35.699" style="s2">comes from computer science if I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.899" end="00:10:37.319" style="s2">about computers and I&#39;m stack ranking</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.699" end="00:10:39.329" style="s2">trying to optimize things in a software</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.319" end="00:10:41.610" style="s2">system that software system is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.329" end="00:10:43.019" style="s2">complicated system as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.610" end="00:10:45.149" style="s2">complex system and I&#39;m going to define</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.019" end="00:10:48.329" style="s2">those formally the difference the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.149" end="00:10:50.819" style="s2">software and the hardware runs on didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.329" end="00:10:52.709" style="s2">self organize right we didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.819" end="00:10:54.209" style="s2">spontaneous self-organization of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.709" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">hydrocarbons into proto cells themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.209" end="00:11:00.269" style="s2">we got somebody did the lithography to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:02.009" style="s2">make the computer chips and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.269" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">blueprint for the hardware and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.009" end="00:11:05.790" style="s2">blueprint for the software in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:07.380" style="s2">complicated system you&#39;ll notice like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.790" end="00:11:07.850" style="s2">this computer and the software doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.380" end="00:11:09.769" style="s2">repair it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.850" end="00:11:12.230" style="s2">so if it gets harmed it doesn&#39;t self</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.769" end="00:11:14.029" style="s2">evolved and the phase space of all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.230" end="00:11:16.579" style="s2">things that can do are fully explicated</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.029" end="00:11:18.290" style="s2">and it has formal causation if I hit</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.579" end="00:11:20.509" style="s2">this key this will happen necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.290" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">sufficient causation in complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.509" end="00:11:25.699" style="s2">like biology there isn&#39;t a blueprint the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:27.709" style="s2">genome isn&#39;t blueprints it&#39;s a generator</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.699" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">function to code new proteins under new</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.709" end="00:11:30.649" style="s2">environments where you can have it do</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:32.269" style="s2">things that it&#39;s never done before if</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.649" end="00:11:34.819" style="s2">you expose it to a novel pathogen or a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.269" end="00:11:36.259" style="s2">novel environment right so a generator</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.819" end="00:11:40.940" style="s2">function and a blueprint aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.259" end="00:11:43.459" style="s2">thing the in a in a complex system also</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.940" end="00:11:45.410" style="s2">it does self heal and self repair it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.459" end="00:11:48.500" style="s2">does also self evolve it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.410" end="00:11:50.569" style="s2">different in type so optimization Theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.500" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">from complicated systems the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.569" end="00:11:54.019" style="s2">where we thought our mind was a clock</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.250" end="00:11:55.190" style="s2">when we figured out clocks before that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.019" end="00:11:57.290" style="s2">Native Americans might have thought of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.190" end="00:11:58.819" style="s2">the mind as an ecosystem right but then</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.290" end="00:12:00.740" style="s2">we got a clock now known the mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.819" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">computer so we pick whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.740" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">metaphor that we&#39;re operating with this</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">but where the metaphor is wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:07.819" style="s2">really fucks stuff up and so it can give</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:09.500" style="s2">you some very partial insights and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.819" end="00:12:12.110" style="s2">some really dreadful differences so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.500" end="00:12:14.540" style="s2">definition of a complex system is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.110" end="00:12:17.779" style="s2">it has some emergent properties beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">what any complicated model of it assumes</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.779" end="00:12:22.730" style="s2">that the complicated model doesn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:24.170" style="s2">so basically if I take a cell and I try</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.730" end="00:12:26.060" style="s2">to model it right so I try to make a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.170" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">software program for how that cell works</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.060" end="00:12:29.630" style="s2">the cell will do some things that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:31.069" style="s2">model doesn&#39;t do and as I keep making</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.630" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">the model better it&#39;ll keep doing some</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.069" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">things that the model doesn&#39;t do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:37.459" style="s2">what we call an emergent property right</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:41.300" style="s2">so what that means is if I make a model</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.459" end="00:12:43.189" style="s2">because the my model of reality isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.300" end="00:12:43.759" style="s2">reality that&#39;s the first verse of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.759" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">right the DAO that is speakable is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.889" end="00:12:51.230" style="s2">the eternal doubt my model of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.459" style="s2">isn&#39;t the actual thing so if I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.230" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">model is the thing and then I try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.459" end="00:12:56.630" style="s2">optimize for the model where the model</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:12:59.660" style="s2">and the thing are different I actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.630" end="00:13:02.350" style="s2">destroy the real thing can you put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.660" end="00:13:04.370" style="s2">into real-world example I make a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.350" end="00:13:06.519" style="s2">economic calculus I make an economic</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.370" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">system for humans or these rational</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.519" end="00:13:13.189" style="s2">self-serving agents and they follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:15.529" style="s2">specific supply and demand economic</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.189" end="00:13:17.180" style="s2">models and laws I can get more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.529" end="00:13:17.959" style="s2">things to be able to look at the laws of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.180" end="00:13:19.699" style="s2">how they&#39;ll do with things like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.959" end="00:13:21.150" style="s2">derivative at blacks goals whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.699" end="00:13:23.070" style="s2">they&#39;re basically simple mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.150" end="00:13:25.890" style="s2">laws and say here&#39;s how we optimize</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.070" end="00:13:27.570" style="s2">maximum productivity and generativity</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.890" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">for everyone and they don&#39;t work right</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.570" end="00:13:30.870" style="s2">like they kind of work and then they</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">also lead to environmental destruction</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.870" end="00:13:36.330" style="s2">which wasn&#39;t part of the metric set so</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">that this is where I&#39;m why I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.330" end="00:13:39.330" style="s2">get you to stack rank things which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.890" end="00:13:40.830" style="s2">interesting that for you that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.330" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">breaks down for me to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.830" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">you mean when you say it doesn&#39;t work I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:46.890" style="s2">have to understand what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">optimize for so once I understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.890" end="00:13:52.140" style="s2">because I in the beginning when I first</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:54.510" style="s2">started diving into you I thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.140" end="00:13:57.300" style="s2">this is about optimizing for what all</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.510" end="00:13:59.370" style="s2">sort of round to human well-being but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.300" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">think there&#39;s an important caveat in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.370" end="00:14:06.120" style="s2">there which to you it is sort of beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:07.620" style="s2">critical and and I think the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.120" end="00:14:10.610" style="s2">meaning and purpose for you is that as</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.620" end="00:14:13.710" style="s2">long as it is not a hell that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.610" end="00:14:15.780" style="s2">continuation is is a critical thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.710" end="00:14:17.880" style="s2">you that is sort of behind every word</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.780" end="00:14:18.840" style="s2">that you say but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.880" end="00:14:20.850" style="s2">interpreting that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.840" end="00:14:23.280" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say that we&#39;re maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:25.670" style="s2">for subjective happiness decoupled from</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.280" end="00:14:28.290" style="s2">objective measures and so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.670" end="00:14:30.540" style="s2">find some types of states that we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.290" end="00:14:32.130" style="s2">subjectively report on it well then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.540" end="00:14:34.170" style="s2">matrix might actually be the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.130" end="00:14:36.030" style="s2">optimize for it right</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.170" end="00:14:37.800" style="s2">disconnect from any kind of object of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.030" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">reality outside of brain stimulus and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.800" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">just brains to make the fuck out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:46.140" style="s2">dopamine urge ik response and say great</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:47.820" style="s2">we optimized for human happiness and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.140" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think anyone actually thinks</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.820" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a maximally meaningful world or</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:14:54.840" style="s2">if we say maximize for the happiness at</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:56.610" style="s2">the individual level well some</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.840" end="00:14:58.020" style="s2">individuals might be sadists and really</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:15:01.080" style="s2">get off on hurting lots of other things</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.020" end="00:15:03.210" style="s2">if we say maximize for continuance a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.080" end="00:15:05.910" style="s2">continuance that is really shitty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.210" end="00:15:07.530" style="s2">like why what is meaningful about life</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.910" end="00:15:08.970" style="s2">that you would want to have continued so</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.530" end="00:15:10.740" style="s2">what you&#39;re what I hear that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.970" end="00:15:14.190" style="s2">trying to ask is what is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.740" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">meaningful what is if we cannot I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.190" end="00:15:21.540" style="s2">use the word optimize but if we can act</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:23.280" style="s2">in ways that benefit different things we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.540" end="00:15:24.600" style="s2">can say optimize but what you can end up</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.280" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">saying is that it&#39;s not optimizing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.600" end="00:15:30.540" style="s2">single metric let me let me actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:32.130" style="s2">make that clear let&#39;s say that I value</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.540" end="00:15:34.370" style="s2">the life of rhinos and I don&#39;t want them</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.130" end="00:15:36.589" style="s2">to go extinct and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.370" end="00:15:37.700" style="s2">also value the life of coral and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.589" end="00:15:39.290" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to go extinct but I also</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.700" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">value kids that I don&#39;t want to starve</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:46.279" style="s2">in the third world and I also value</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">subjective happiness of poets now how</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.279" end="00:15:52.100" style="s2">many dead rhinos are worth how much dead</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">coral are worth how many dead kids are</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.100" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">worth how much lack of happiness are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">worth how many tons of co2 how do i</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.950" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">commensurate those metrics to then be</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.180" end="00:16:02.440" style="s2">able to say what my optimization</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:05.390" style="s2">algorithm is going to optimize for I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.440" end="00:16:07.490" style="s2">have to do some kind of waiting and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.390" end="00:16:09.140" style="s2">I say well but in the context where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.490" end="00:16:10.490" style="s2">Rhinos get below a certain number</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.140" end="00:16:11.900" style="s2">they&#39;re worth more but then when they</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.490" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">get above a certain number they get oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.900" end="00:16:15.140" style="s2">but then I didn&#39;t even account for all</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.430" end="00:16:16.640" style="s2">the things these soil microbes without</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.140" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">which everything dies and I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.640" end="00:16:19.130" style="s2">account for them and this isn&#39;t now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">gotta bring soil microbes into it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.130" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">then I didn&#39;t account for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:24.860" style="s2">subjective reporting will have these</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:26.839" style="s2">biases or miss these things or orient</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.860" end="00:16:28.550" style="s2">towards addiction so whatever my</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.839" end="00:16:30.170" style="s2">optimization said is there will be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.550" end="00:16:32.029" style="s2">things that are matter that are outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.170" end="00:16:35.529" style="s2">of it that I have to continuously bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.029" end="00:16:38.180" style="s2">in so the optimization is for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.529" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">evolutionary integrity of the whole or</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:44.350" style="s2">wholeness itself which is different than</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:47.209" style="s2">how we think of theory of optimization</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.350" end="00:16:50.050" style="s2">so do we care about people&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.209" end="00:16:51.950" style="s2">experience yes you also care about</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.050" end="00:16:53.690" style="s2">objective metrics of the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.950" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">their life like longevity and physical</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.690" end="00:16:57.500" style="s2">health and things like that yes also</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:16:59.209" style="s2">care about that do they correlate</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.500" end="00:17:00.500" style="s2">one-for-one no there are some very happy</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.209" end="00:17:02.150" style="s2">people who are crippled then there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.500" end="00:17:03.740" style="s2">some very physically able people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.150" end="00:17:05.380" style="s2">miserable there are some people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.740" end="00:17:09.829" style="s2">happy who make other people miserable</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.380" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">and so and do we care about just</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.829" end="00:17:12.949" style="s2">individual quality of life or also the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:14.600" style="s2">relationships what about happiness</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.949" end="00:17:16.309" style="s2">versus evolutionary rate what if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.600" end="00:17:18.620" style="s2">could be happy but stagnate versus</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.309" end="00:17:21.770" style="s2">evolve quite quickly but never enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.620" end="00:17:23.420" style="s2">things we were evolving to and we all</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.770" end="00:17:25.309" style="s2">have this in our own life right like if</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.420" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">do I want to be bettering myself but in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.309" end="00:17:28.189" style="s2">a way where I&#39;m bettering myself because</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:29.690" style="s2">of the driver that I&#39;m a piece of shit</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.189" end="00:17:31.670" style="s2">who&#39;s never enough so I always have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.690" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">get better but I never actually enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.670" end="00:17:35.240" style="s2">any of it or do I accept myself in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:36.740" style="s2">that makes me complacent well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.240" end="00:17:38.780" style="s2">it&#39;s neither of those I want to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.740" end="00:17:42.500" style="s2">what it is fully and have my love of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.780" end="00:17:44.570" style="s2">life have me want to keep growing not</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.500" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">because of a dysfunctional driver right</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.570" end="00:17:48.049" style="s2">so I&#39;m optimizing for if anything the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:50.389" style="s2">product of the dialect</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.049" end="00:17:52.700" style="s2">of my experience of life now and my</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.389" end="00:17:53.470" style="s2">ability to experience life more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.700" end="00:17:57.019" style="s2">into the future</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.470" end="00:17:59.899" style="s2">now if I take both sides I say I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.019" end="00:18:02.600" style="s2">in I want to be able to enjoy the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.899" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">of life as fully as I can now I also</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.600" end="00:18:07.129" style="s2">want to be able to add to the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:09.019" style="s2">life for other people I also want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.129" end="00:18:11.539" style="s2">deepen my capacity to experience the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.019" end="00:18:13.639" style="s2">beauty of life and add to it being doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.539" end="00:18:15.799" style="s2">and becoming and then you say how do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.639" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">optimize for a virtuous cycle between</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.799" end="00:18:19.340" style="s2">the modes of being doing becoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:23.049" style="s2">individually and collectively now we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:25.669" style="s2">start to get in the right direction so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.049" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">basically this shit is complicated so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.669" end="00:18:31.909" style="s2">when I think about so you I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">how much you think of yourself is being</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.909" end="00:18:36.259" style="s2">tied to game B but certainly your name</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:38.570" style="s2">comes up a lot with this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.259" end="00:18:40.369" style="s2">game B it&#39;d be great if you can quickly</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.570" end="00:18:42.470" style="s2">sort of break down what game a is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.369" end="00:18:46.700" style="s2">game B is and then what I find</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.470" end="00:18:48.529" style="s2">interesting is okay Ken what one it do</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.700" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">we believe it to be conceivable that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.529" end="00:18:54.200" style="s2">can actually construct realistically</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:56.419" style="s2">game B by putting systems or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.200" end="00:18:58.220" style="s2">is that&#39;s going to be in place there but</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.419" end="00:18:59.690" style="s2">first I think people have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.220" end="00:19:01.609" style="s2">what it is and then we can go down the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.690" end="00:19:02.509" style="s2">road of that conversation so if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.609" end="00:19:05.749" style="s2">don&#39;t mind really fast</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.509" end="00:19:10.279" style="s2">what&#39;s game a what&#39;s gonna be the term</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.749" end="00:19:12.289" style="s2">game B was coined by Jordan Hall and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.279" end="00:19:13.429" style="s2">Weinsteins and Jim rut and a number of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.289" end="00:19:15.950" style="s2">other people that were brought together</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.429" end="00:19:19.460" style="s2">at Santa Fe Institute back in the day to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.950" end="00:19:20.629" style="s2">think about a new civilization that had</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:22.700" style="s2">fundamentally new and better</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.629" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">characteristics and so in Contra</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.700" end="00:19:28.879" style="s2">distinction to the idea that this thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:30.470" style="s2">which is obviously the US civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.879" end="00:19:32.179" style="s2">today and a hundred years ago in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.470" end="00:19:33.739" style="s2">u.s. versus Chinese civilization are</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.179" end="00:19:35.629" style="s2">different but they&#39;re all part of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.739" end="00:19:37.100" style="s2">system that has certain system</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.629" end="00:19:38.600" style="s2">dispositions like environmental</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.100" end="00:19:40.340" style="s2">disruptions happening across the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.600" end="00:19:41.989" style="s2">thing wealth inequalities happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.340" end="00:19:44.509" style="s2">across the whole thing so game a is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.989" end="00:19:46.999" style="s2">basically the idea of game theory which</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.509" end="00:19:49.159" style="s2">is individual people individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.999" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">corporations individual races nations</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.159" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">whatever competing against each other in</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:56.840" style="s2">ways that mmm maximize their benefit as</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">much as they can even if it harms or</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.840" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">externalizes harm to other players or</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:01.070" style="s2">the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.049" style="s2">so roughly game</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.070" end="00:20:06.049" style="s2">a is a civilization that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.049" end="00:20:08.409" style="s2">dominated by game theory game which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.049" end="00:20:10.970" style="s2">basically what we&#39;re living in right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.409" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">there was a recognition and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.970" end="00:20:14.149" style="s2">part of that crew I made friends with</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:15.980" style="s2">them after they actually disbanded that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.149" end="00:20:17.269" style="s2">thing and then it kind of recycled and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.980" end="00:20:22.309" style="s2">was working on similar things in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.269" end="00:20:24.230" style="s2">different context so game B is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.309" end="00:20:26.809" style="s2">what would the game be what would the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.230" end="00:20:29.090" style="s2">kind of game dynamics or how people show</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.809" end="00:20:31.100" style="s2">up in play of a game that doesn&#39;t orient</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.090" end="00:20:33.080" style="s2">toward self-determination so we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:35.000" style="s2">to unpack a bit why we would say game a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.080" end="00:20:37.399" style="s2">does intrinsically self-terminate what</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.000" end="00:20:39.139" style="s2">are the properties about it to say what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.399" end="00:20:42.980" style="s2">would categorical solutions to those</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.139" end="00:20:44.600" style="s2">look like yeah so I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.980" end="00:20:46.639" style="s2">answer the question at least as I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.600" end="00:20:48.019" style="s2">understand it basically of a world with</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.639" end="00:20:50.750" style="s2">finite resources where you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.019" end="00:20:53.529" style="s2">incentivized so whaling is a great</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.750" end="00:20:55.700" style="s2">example I&#39;ve heard you use before if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.529" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">capture that whale then you can sell it</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.700" end="00:20:59.029" style="s2">you can monetize it if you it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:00.769" style="s2">basically value to take it out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.029" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">ocean as zero value in the ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.769" end="00:21:04.309" style="s2">even if you were to say no no I want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:05.629" style="s2">live in the world where the whale stays</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.309" end="00:21:07.009" style="s2">in the ocean there&#39;s somebody else who</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.629" end="00:21:09.080" style="s2">goes how all right motherfucker I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.009" end="00:21:10.220" style="s2">gonna go get the whale then so now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.080" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">like you&#39;re gonna lose the whale anyway</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.220" end="00:21:13.159" style="s2">so you might as well be the one that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:14.179" style="s2">takes it and in a world of infinite</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.159" end="00:21:15.470" style="s2">resources you could actually get away</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.179" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">with that but in the world of finite</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.470" end="00:21:19.789" style="s2">resources as you say it it ends itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:23.269" style="s2">eventually so you will run out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.789" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">resources specifically because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.269" end="00:21:27.559" style="s2">that me seing the whale in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t provide any value to me that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.559" end="00:21:33.259" style="s2">call value I might feel a sense of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:35.389" style="s2">seeing it right I might feel a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.259" end="00:21:37.909" style="s2">interconnectedness or beauty or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.389" end="00:21:39.590" style="s2">it is but that doesn&#39;t increase my games</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.909" end="00:21:41.659" style="s2">here at a capacity to do anything I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.590" end="00:21:43.009" style="s2">can&#39;t extract and exchange that value</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.659" end="00:21:44.990" style="s2">that experiencial value but if I kill</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.009" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">the whale and I sell it as meat and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.990" end="00:21:48.649" style="s2">get that money that I can then go buy</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">weapons or building materials or employ</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.649" end="00:21:52.940" style="s2">people with that actually increases my</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">power so there are kinds of value that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.940" end="00:21:56.149" style="s2">are extractable and exchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:21:57.889" style="s2">extractable accumulated will</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.149" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">exchangeable that increased power and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.889" end="00:22:01.549" style="s2">there are types of value that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:03.769" style="s2">appreciated but don&#39;t increase power so</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.549" end="00:22:06.049" style="s2">those who orient to the power increasing</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.769" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">value end up getting more power and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.049" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">dominating the system dynamics so then</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">that creates a race to do that thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.690" style="s2">because like you said if I don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.500" end="00:22:16.340" style="s2">the whale I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.690" end="00:22:17.990" style="s2">protecting the whale because somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.340" end="00:22:19.820" style="s2">else is gonna kill the whale now those</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.990" end="00:22:21.500" style="s2">guys might actually be my enemies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.820" end="00:22:23.210" style="s2">use that increased economic ability</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.500" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna feed more people</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.210" end="00:22:25.640" style="s2">their population is going to grow and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:28.040" style="s2">then they&#39;re gonna come kill us on war</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.640" end="00:22:29.750" style="s2">so actually for my own security not only</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.040" end="00:22:31.640" style="s2">do I have to now kill the whale I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.750" end="00:22:33.800" style="s2">to race to get them faster than that guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.640" end="00:22:36.140" style="s2">because now we&#39;re in a growth race which</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.800" end="00:22:38.150" style="s2">also means I&#39;m gonna advance whaling</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.140" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">technologies to be able to take way more</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.150" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">than I need grow my population base</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:44.120" style="s2">start exporting to other population</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">bases so that I can get the optionality</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.120" end="00:22:47.750" style="s2">of money to build other kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">with and so what we end up giving is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.750" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2">being able to see the industrialized</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.790" style="s2">fishing mechanisms that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:22:58.130" style="s2">operating today that can fish more fish</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.790" end="00:23:00.050" style="s2">in a single net than maybe all of human</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:08.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like the that kind of arms race</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.850" end="00:23:10.520" style="s2">multiplied by the ability to keep</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.090" end="00:23:21.470" style="s2">I lose by default and then I have to try</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">advancing it but when you&#39;re advancing</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.170" end="00:23:33.410" style="s2">your weaponry and so in mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:35.390" style="s2">advancing relative to you you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.390" end="00:23:38.150" style="s2">get a compounding curve which is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.040" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2">exponential curve and we&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.150" end="00:23:41.540" style="s2">recently started to get to the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.860" end="00:23:43.180" style="s2">icing part of that curve started to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.540" end="00:23:45.560" style="s2">steep with the Industrial Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.180" end="00:23:47.060" style="s2">then it started to go very steep with</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.560" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">the information kind of revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.060" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">we&#39;re just in a phase of what has really</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:53.570" style="s2">been a process that started since stone</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:54.950" style="s2">tools it was just a very slow curve and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.570" end="00:23:56.450" style="s2">the stone tools thing for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.950" end="00:23:59.090" style="s2">and now it is in the quickly vertical</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.450" end="00:24:01.850" style="s2">izing so the thing is when you look in</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.090" end="00:24:03.350" style="s2">nature you see well animals compete they</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.850" end="00:24:05.900" style="s2">don&#39;t increase their competitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.350" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">capacity rapidly or irrespective of each</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">other right the tiger can&#39;t just become</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:13.820" style="s2">way better at hunting it has a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:15.560" style="s2">fixed killing capacity and it can only</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.820" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">get better through natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.560" end="00:24:19.100" style="s2">which is a pretty slow process but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:20.570" style="s2">key is that it&#39;s a slow process that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.100" end="00:24:22.940" style="s2">evenly distributed across the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.570" end="00:24:24.710" style="s2">forest because the things that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.940" end="00:24:27.380" style="s2">gene mutation and the tiger also leads</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.710" end="00:24:29.179" style="s2">to gene mutation in the deer</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.380" end="00:24:30.740" style="s2">the slightly faster tiger that eats the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.179" end="00:24:32.750" style="s2">slightly slower deers makes the better</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.740" end="00:24:34.280" style="s2">jeans the faster jeans and the deers in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.750" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">breed together and so everything steps</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.280" end="00:24:38.150" style="s2">up together very slowly in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.620" style="s2">environment does what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.150" end="00:24:42.110" style="s2">stone tools as humans were able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.620" end="00:24:43.789" style="s2">increase our per day dove capacity way</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.110" end="00:24:46.280" style="s2">faster than the environment could</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.789" end="00:24:47.900" style="s2">increase its resilience to it and so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.280" end="00:24:49.820" style="s2">could start extinct ting species and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.900" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">devastating whole environments turning</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.820" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">them to desert and moving on that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">the beginning of something very</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:56.150" style="s2">different so when we think of social</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:58.280" style="s2">Darwinism where we try to model</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.150" end="00:25:00.350" style="s2">ourselves as apex predators we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.280" end="00:25:03.470" style="s2">not fucking apex predators apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.350" end="00:25:05.450" style="s2">theory doesn&#39;t apply because in Orca can</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.470" end="00:25:07.490" style="s2">kill a tuna at a time and it misses my</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.450" end="00:25:09.980" style="s2">time we can pull up a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.490" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">of them in a fishing that at once and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.980" end="00:25:15.169" style="s2">since the Orca can&#39;t destroy it whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:16.909" style="s2">ecosystems and we can if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.169" end="00:25:18.350" style="s2">modeling ourselves with apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.909" end="00:25:20.289" style="s2">theory and having to exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.350" end="00:25:22.460" style="s2">increase or destructive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.289" end="00:25:24.860" style="s2">exponential destruction whether in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.460" end="00:25:26.900" style="s2">form of extraction pollution or military</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.860" end="00:25:29.000" style="s2">destruction or disinformation and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.900" end="00:25:30.380" style="s2">start getting into the space of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.000" end="00:25:33.020" style="s2">able to win through information warfare</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.380" end="00:25:34.280" style="s2">ends up destroying the Commons so one</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.020" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">thing I want to I want to put a fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.280" end="00:25:37.070" style="s2">point on that you just said that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:38.179" style="s2">heard you say this before and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.070" end="00:25:41.299" style="s2">missed until just now</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.179" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">is what&#39;s causing that ever escalation</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.299" end="00:25:44.659" style="s2">is because you&#39;re doing that in concert</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:47.900" style="s2">with people who are essentially your</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.659" end="00:25:49.280" style="s2">enemies so like with AI it it almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.900" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">certainly will be a winner-take-all game</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.280" end="00:25:53.510" style="s2">because if somebody can beat you by a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:56.990" style="s2">month and for a computer that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.510" end="00:25:59.809" style="s2">hundred years worth of learning you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.990" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">see how just being the first is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.809" end="00:26:04.370" style="s2">gonna be the victor and so now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">got the sort of ever escalating desire</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.370" end="00:26:09.380" style="s2">to either protect yourself or to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:12.590" style="s2">monetize and thusly the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.380" end="00:26:14.809" style="s2">Commons so this is part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.590" end="00:26:17.870" style="s2">that I was trying to figure out sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.809" end="00:26:20.150" style="s2">what you value most because for me</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.870" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">everything comes down to if you want if</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:23.179" style="s2">you want to build a business I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.190" style="s2">speak in those terms which I understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.179" end="00:26:26.030" style="s2">very well you have to have a goal you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.190" end="00:26:28.429" style="s2">have to know what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.030" end="00:26:31.220" style="s2">accomplish and the clear the goal the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.429" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">more likely you are to hit it and if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.220" end="00:26:34.789" style="s2">don&#39;t have a clear goal then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">sort of steering by a vague sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.789" end="00:26:37.700" style="s2">what you want to accomplish and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:39.049" style="s2">going to become very difficult but there</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.700" end="00:26:40.280" style="s2">are what I call the physics of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.049" end="00:26:41.960" style="s2">human and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.280" end="00:26:43.610" style="s2">what I&#39;m obsessed with this humans are a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.960" end="00:26:45.380" style="s2">certain kind of way their you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.610" end="00:26:47.030" style="s2">a biological experience your brain is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.380" end="00:26:49.880" style="s2">certain way it processes data in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.030" end="00:26:52.940" style="s2">certain way and whatever you do has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.880" end="00:26:57.380" style="s2">align with the reality of what humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">are like and so going to game B and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.380" end="00:27:01.190" style="s2">thinking about constructing that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.660" style="s2">building something it&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.190" end="00:27:06.260" style="s2">were describing how interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.660" end="00:27:07.850" style="s2">everything is how complicated it is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:10.100" style="s2">really gives me pause about like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.850" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">thinking about Jesus man to really do</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.100" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">something it is going to be it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.440" end="00:27:16.730" style="s2">to be really fucking difficult and when</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.130" style="s2">I when I go back through and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.730" end="00:27:21.830" style="s2">people that were a part of the game a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.130" end="00:27:24.020" style="s2">game B conversation it&#39;s like I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.830" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">very interested to see if ideas keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.020" end="00:27:28.040" style="s2">coming out and they&#39;re iterative and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:30.380" style="s2">find a way to actually migrate to an</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.040" end="00:27:32.690" style="s2">entirely new approach I mean it would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.380" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">a new financial system it would be new</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.690" end="00:27:39.380" style="s2">architecture at every conceivable level</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">of society and my first question is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.380" end="00:27:45.650" style="s2">are we aiming at like what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:48.410" style="s2">that we&#39;re I want to say optimize but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.650" end="00:27:50.870" style="s2">know that that trips something that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.410" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">don&#39;t fully understand yet but what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.870" end="00:27:55.490" style="s2">we steering towards I can give you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">very concrete set of examples it will</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.490" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">make this make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.890" end="00:28:06.770" style="s2">let&#39;s take Cove it and say when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.700" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">the CDC or the White House or the whu-oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.770" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">or whatever institutions are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.890" style="s2">respond competently to it what should</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:15.140" style="s2">our goal be what are we trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.890" end="00:28:16.940" style="s2">optimize for well let&#39;s say we pick the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.140" end="00:28:21.290" style="s2">goal of optimizing for the least deaths</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.940" end="00:28:23.240" style="s2">from kovat okay so we will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.290" end="00:28:25.370" style="s2">institute quarantines and contact</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.240" end="00:28:28.550" style="s2">tracing and a bunch of things it will</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.370" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">decrease total transmission well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.550" end="00:28:33.680" style="s2">a chunk of that that we did that led to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.830" style="s2">the breakdown of the supply chains for</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.680" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">food and we&#39;re still in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.830" end="00:28:40.220" style="s2">that rolling catastrophe and the new</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:41.510" style="s2">cycle has moved on to other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.220" end="00:28:45.380" style="s2">role in catastrophe so we weren&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.510" end="00:28:47.720" style="s2">attention to it but when we wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.980" end="00:29:39.740" style="s2">so we just were dealing with no change</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.789" end="00:30:04.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the example of what I&#39;d call a</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.789" end="00:30:18.860" style="s2">worse problem so when we define our</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.860" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">maximum amount of money from the thing I</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.950" style="s2">right if but is that way you hear me</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.610" end="00:30:29.890" style="s2">saying because I&#39;m not I&#39;m not saying it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.950" end="00:30:33.080" style="s2">needs to be narrowly defined I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.890" end="00:30:35.630" style="s2">what is like what is that as as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.080" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">who is really fucking thoughtful about</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.630" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">this topic how do you think about those</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:42.760" style="s2">second-order consequences third-order</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">consequences like that crazy biome of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.760" end="00:30:49.700" style="s2">interconnected things now now that how</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:52.010" style="s2">do we think about the interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.700" end="00:30:53.240" style="s2">how do we think about not one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.010" end="00:30:55.190" style="s2">matters but all the things and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.240" end="00:30:56.899" style="s2">relationships between them and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.190" end="00:30:59.419" style="s2">think about how to make not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.899" end="00:31:01.130" style="s2">individual choices but whole complexes</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.419" end="00:31:03.260" style="s2">of choices that benefit all those things</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.130" end="00:31:05.029" style="s2">and the relationships is how we start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.260" end="00:31:07.610" style="s2">think about it properly and it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.029" end="00:31:12.679" style="s2">higher level of complexity of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.610" end="00:31:17.150" style="s2">so when I think about Co vid goal think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.679" end="00:31:20.140" style="s2">okay well we want to minimize the total</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.150" end="00:31:25.220" style="s2">number of kovat related to us all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.140" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">but there are people who can die and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.220" end="00:31:28.670" style="s2">recut I mean there are people who can</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:30.860" style="s2">get it and not die but have permanent</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.670" end="00:31:32.660" style="s2">disabilities in terms of damage to heart</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.860" end="00:31:34.360" style="s2">or lung or kidneys or whatever we&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.660" end="00:31:37.340" style="s2">like to do something with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.360" end="00:31:39.620" style="s2">preventing ICU overwhelm was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.340" end="00:31:41.630" style="s2">really critical goal before prevent</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.620" end="00:31:43.309" style="s2">total number of deaths because the death</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.630" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">spike would go up radically so you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.309" end="00:31:46.610" style="s2">to think about upstream ones Wells</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.440" style="s2">downstream ones but then we start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.610" end="00:31:50.690" style="s2">think about okay let&#39;s make sure that in</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.440" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">doing that we don&#39;t damage other things</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.690" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">significantly so when people are on</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:57.950" style="s2">quarantine how much does domestic</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:32:00.200" style="s2">violence go up what happens to addiction</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.950" end="00:32:01.910" style="s2">patterns for kids who don&#39;t have school</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:04.130" style="s2">and just have six months of solid screen</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.910" end="00:32:06.980" style="s2">time what happens to an economy where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.130" end="00:32:09.770" style="s2">you have 40 million jobs that go that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.980" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">are lost now we see a lot of violence we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.770" end="00:32:13.669" style="s2">always see more violence whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:16.220" style="s2">systemic racism as the trigger or other</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.669" end="00:32:17.720" style="s2">triggers when we always need more</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.220" end="00:32:21.980" style="s2">violence when people are out of work</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.720" end="00:32:23.690" style="s2">yeah right so I&#39;m being met by a system</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.980" end="00:32:25.309" style="s2">they don&#39;t stay complacent with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.690" end="00:32:27.049" style="s2">system that&#39;s failing them so if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.309" end="00:32:29.809" style="s2">think of this as like four or five</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.049" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">dimensional chess like where where is</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.809" end="00:32:33.559" style="s2">the human animals capacity to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">this like are we actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.559" end="00:32:39.020" style="s2">able to get people to think in that many</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:44.750" style="s2">ways we&#39;re already failing to do it with</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.020" end="00:32:46.400" style="s2">kovat do you think that that is when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.750" end="00:32:49.220" style="s2">go back to the physics of being human I</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.400" end="00:32:51.860" style="s2">begin my hypothesis is I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.220" end="00:32:54.230" style="s2">not sure that we&#39;ll be able to I take I</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.860" end="00:32:55.340" style="s2">take a very optimistic view of most</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.230" end="00:32:58.340" style="s2">things but on that one</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.340" end="00:33:00.679" style="s2">whew building a brand new civilization</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.340" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">without people first having to suffer a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.679" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">level of in tolerability seems tough</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:08.059" style="s2">seems tough to get them to believe the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.950" end="00:33:09.620" style="s2">things that they would have to do to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.059" end="00:33:12.620" style="s2">leave the whale in the ocean or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.620" end="00:33:15.410" style="s2">you know example we&#39;re going to use do</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.620" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">you have thoughts around how we give a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.410" end="00:33:19.160" style="s2">simple enough narrative that people can</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">latch on and understand okay cool I get</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.160" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">what we have to do here</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.300" end="00:33:33.080" style="s2">for the most part we aren&#39;t even trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.220" end="00:33:35.630" style="s2">to think about second or third order</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.080" end="00:33:37.100" style="s2">effects currently like it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.630" end="00:33:38.270" style="s2">thing we try to do do you think nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.100" end="00:33:40.430" style="s2">thinking about it or the people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.270" end="00:33:42.890" style="s2">listening cuz it&#39;s not sexy like when I</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.430" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">think about what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.890" end="00:33:48.230" style="s2">so with everything that was shaking down</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:49.940" style="s2">with the death of George Floyd and how</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.230" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">everything sparked off that I started</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.940" end="00:33:53.090" style="s2">like really looking into I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.290" style="s2">to just say some bullshit to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.090" end="00:33:56.180" style="s2">bullshit like I wanted to actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.290" end="00:33:59.540" style="s2">understand like really truly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.180" end="00:34:01.190" style="s2">going on so I end up seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.540" end="00:34:03.830" style="s2">discussion about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.190" end="00:34:05.210" style="s2">Martin Luther King jr. and Malcolm X and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.830" end="00:34:07.160" style="s2">now Martin Luther King jr. had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.210" end="00:34:09.350" style="s2">meta-narrative which was religion it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.160" end="00:34:10.880" style="s2">about unity but he was measured and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.350" end="00:34:12.590" style="s2">mean he was very passionate obviously</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.880" end="00:34:15.140" style="s2">when he spoke but it was like this sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.590" end="00:34:17.090" style="s2">of calming soothing thing about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.140" end="00:34:19.430" style="s2">people together whereas Malcolm X was</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.090" end="00:34:21.050" style="s2">black power there was energy there was</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.430" end="00:34:22.730" style="s2">aggression it was tapping into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.050" end="00:34:24.140" style="s2">anger that was right there below the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.730" end="00:34:25.910" style="s2">surface there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.140" end="00:34:28.850" style="s2">counterintuitive about it and so he was</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.910" end="00:34:30.950" style="s2">able to really get people motivated and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.850" end="00:34:32.330" style="s2">rallied and I thought that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.950" end="00:34:33.380" style="s2">like when you think about human animus</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.330" end="00:34:34.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something that pisses you off</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.380" end="00:34:38.090" style="s2">and it gives you the energy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.900" end="00:34:42.260" style="s2">literally the world was burning last</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.090" end="00:34:44.930" style="s2">week and you gave people just a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.260" end="00:34:47.960" style="s2">bit of a justification to tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.930" end="00:34:51.560" style="s2">there is something about tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.960" end="00:34:54.920" style="s2">that aggression that level of animation</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.560" end="00:34:57.320" style="s2">there&#39;s an intoxication to rage and when</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.920" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">you can even just nudge people a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.320" end="00:35:00.950" style="s2">bit into that you get that so my thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:04.820" style="s2">is I hear people talking you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.950" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">about this crazy eloquently but is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.820" end="00:35:11.030" style="s2">giving people that sexy level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:13.130" style="s2">animation to to get visceral to tap into</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.030" end="00:35:20.120" style="s2">something that&#39;s aggressive and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.130" end="00:35:21.860" style="s2">feels so powerful I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.120" end="00:35:23.990" style="s2">house that I&#39;m in right now it probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.860" end="00:35:25.010" style="s2">took about a year to build and I could</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.990" end="00:35:29.750" style="s2">take it down with a wrecker ball in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.010" end="00:35:31.370" style="s2">minutes or fire it takes 20 plus years</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.750" end="00:35:31.940" style="s2">to grow an adult human kill them in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.370" end="00:35:34.040" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.940" end="00:35:36.950" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to break shit</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.040" end="00:35:39.350" style="s2">and the motivational complexes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.950" end="00:35:40.940" style="s2">break shit and motivational complexes</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.350" end="00:35:43.910" style="s2">that figure out how to build complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.940" end="00:35:46.100" style="s2">things aren&#39;t the same so yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.910" end="00:35:48.770" style="s2">power and can you give me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.100" end="00:35:52.070" style="s2">about what the motivations are you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.770" end="00:35:54.680" style="s2">talked very well about human motivations</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.070" end="00:35:56.150" style="s2">status seeking like earlier when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.680" end="00:35:57.320" style="s2">mentioned power I almost stopped you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.150" end="00:35:59.570" style="s2">because I wanted you to actually define</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.320" end="00:36:01.400" style="s2">what is power why do we give a shit I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.570" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">think it would help people it would help</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.400" end="00:36:04.580" style="s2">me I want to understand what is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:05.420" style="s2">difference specifically in those</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.580" end="00:36:18.020" style="s2">motivation types</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.420" end="00:36:20.570" style="s2">I can&#39;t stay enraged for all that long</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.020" end="00:36:22.130" style="s2">in a certain amount of time I can say in</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.570" end="00:36:23.480" style="s2">rage long enough to break this house but</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.130" end="00:36:25.010" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t stay enraged long enough for</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.480" end="00:36:29.050" style="s2">that to be the motivation to build it I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.010" end="00:36:31.610" style="s2">was fucking yeah and the rage wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.050" end="00:36:33.230" style="s2">be the right frame of mind for me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.610" end="00:36:37.580" style="s2">learn the structural engineering to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.230" end="00:36:38.780" style="s2">the blueprints or to try to have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.580" end="00:36:41.510" style="s2">metallurgy to be able to make bigger</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.780" end="00:36:43.190" style="s2">buildings that had better trusses that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.510" end="00:36:45.320" style="s2">requires a very different frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.190" end="00:36:47.090" style="s2">that is doing planning over a longer</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.320" end="00:36:49.310" style="s2">period of time and for the most part the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.090" end="00:36:51.530" style="s2">limbic process you&#39;re describing in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.310" end="00:36:53.330" style="s2">prefrontal process I&#39;m describing are</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.530" end="00:36:54.680" style="s2">inversely proportional in the brain the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.330" end="00:36:55.940" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;re in one is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.680" end="00:37:00.830" style="s2">degree to which were mostly not</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.940" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">accessing the other and so what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.830" end="00:37:08.120" style="s2">motives are useful for what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:10.550" style="s2">goals as an important question and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.120" end="00:37:12.950" style="s2">the degree that we want to build things</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.550" end="00:37:14.870" style="s2">that have complexity long term we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.950" end="00:37:17.000" style="s2">to be able to access the places of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.870" end="00:37:19.070" style="s2">mind and capabilities that can think</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.000" end="00:37:25.100" style="s2">long term and complexly can we nudge</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.070" end="00:37:27.080" style="s2">people in a direction okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.100" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">actually a great question that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.080" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">take in a slightly different place can</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:39.350" style="s2">we merge people in a direction is a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:41.330" style="s2">interesting question which is so who is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.350" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">the we that would be doing the nudging</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.330" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">and who is the people that some we is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:47.420" style="s2">saying we want to influence them we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:49.099" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.420" end="00:37:50.750" style="s2">we want them to think and feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.099" end="00:37:52.520" style="s2">differently and change their behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.750" end="00:37:54.920" style="s2">for some goals we have that they may not</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.520" end="00:37:56.299" style="s2">have how can we change their goals and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.920" end="00:37:58.970" style="s2">change their behavior and manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.299" end="00:38:01.190" style="s2">their emotions do you want me to answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.970" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">that question sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.190" end="00:38:12.710" style="s2">so that this is exactly what I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:15.500" style="s2">given my life to which is I for a long</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.710" end="00:38:18.260" style="s2">time I tried to help my mother change</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.500" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">and my mother smoked my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.260" end="00:38:22.040" style="s2">morbidly obese she&#39;s amazing and I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:24.589" style="s2">her to live as long as humanly possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.040" end="00:38:25.790" style="s2">and I as I say you can lead a horse to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.589" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">water but you can&#39;t make them drink and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.790" end="00:38:28.099" style="s2">then people say focus on making them</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.900" end="00:38:29.540" style="s2">thirsty and I&#39;m like oh my god it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.099" end="00:38:30.980" style="s2">amazing yes I just need to make my mom</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:33.500" style="s2">thirsty this is gonna be amazing make</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.980" end="00:38:35.630" style="s2">her want change and I realized I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.500" end="00:38:38.599" style="s2">and now it may be that I just suck and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.630" end="00:38:42.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not able to find that thing in her</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.599" end="00:38:44.059" style="s2">so it got me obsessed so I people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:47.740" style="s2">are that have followed me will have</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.059" end="00:38:50.359" style="s2">heard this many times forgive me but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.740" end="00:38:51.799" style="s2">really I had at my last company had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.359" end="00:38:54.500" style="s2">thousand employees a group hard as hell</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.799" end="00:38:56.930" style="s2">in the inner cities like fuck crazy shit</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.500" end="00:38:59.299" style="s2">and shot my sister shot in the heart</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.930" end="00:39:00.710" style="s2">with an ak-47 in my front yard I held my</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.299" end="00:39:02.450" style="s2">stepfather while he bled to death from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.710" end="00:39:03.859" style="s2">gunshot wound to the head another kid</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:05.540" style="s2">hid under a car while his best friend</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.859" end="00:39:08.210" style="s2">had to hold his intestines in from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.540" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">point-blank range shotgun blast I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.210" end="00:39:11.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just story after story after story</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.400" style="s2">is insane so I started thinking okay how</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.720" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">do I help them make change some people</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.400" end="00:39:17.150" style="s2">you can just tell them think like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:19.220" style="s2">act like this they do it it&#39;s radically</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.150" end="00:39:21.650" style="s2">transformative it opens up avenues of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.220" end="00:39:23.869" style="s2">learning and growth and it&#39;s amazing but</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.650" end="00:39:26.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll say that&#39;s about 2% of people at</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.869" end="00:39:28.849" style="s2">least with my skill level 98% do not</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.990" end="00:39:30.380" style="s2">they hear the information they may even</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.849" end="00:39:32.420" style="s2">get excited about it might be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.380" end="00:39:34.609" style="s2">entertainment but they don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.420" end="00:39:35.900" style="s2">and so over the course of a month like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.609" end="00:39:37.460" style="s2">remember so many of them would show up</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.900" end="00:39:38.990" style="s2">to a book club not put on by me put on</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.460" end="00:39:40.220" style="s2">by other people they would get amped up</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.990" end="00:39:41.780" style="s2">but then they wouldn&#39;t read the books</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.220" end="00:39:44.750" style="s2">they&#39;d stop showing up so it was just</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.780" end="00:39:46.520" style="s2">like it it&#39;s just so short-lived so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.750" end="00:39:49.099" style="s2">started asking myself the question no</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.520" end="00:39:50.990" style="s2">bullshit what would it take to give</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.099" end="00:39:53.690" style="s2">somebody a growth mindset even if they</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.990" end="00:39:56.299" style="s2">were antagonistic to a growth mindset</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.690" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">and I thought okay if I can solve for</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.299" end="00:39:59.540" style="s2">that which by the way I have not but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:00.650" style="s2">I can solve for that somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.540" end="00:40:02.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to change</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.650" end="00:40:06.380" style="s2">not only doesn&#39;t they&#39;re not apathetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.660" end="00:40:08.809" style="s2">they&#39;re actively opposed to changing if</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.380" end="00:40:11.630" style="s2">I can find the magic sequence of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.809" end="00:40:13.130" style="s2">of words of whatever to get that person</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.630" end="00:40:16.190" style="s2">to be like oh my god like I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.130" end="00:40:18.410" style="s2">do something I can learn I can express</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.190" end="00:40:19.970" style="s2">myself whatever but now I&#39;m moving in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.410" end="00:40:22.579" style="s2">positive direction where before I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.970" end="00:40:25.940" style="s2">moving in a negative direction so it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.579" end="00:40:27.980" style="s2">is I have come to the conclusion with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.940" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">desires and skillset the storytelling is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.980" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">a way to do that so I think a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:34.760" style="s2">nudging people like how much can you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:39.230" style="s2">shift the pop culture narrative in a non</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.760" end="00:40:40.670" style="s2">sinister way but to have a kid so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.230" end="00:40:42.500" style="s2">more I looked into it the more I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.670" end="00:40:44.180" style="s2">realized yo I need to hit kids at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.500" end="00:40:46.010" style="s2">age of imprinting I&#39;m not talented</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.180" end="00:40:48.109" style="s2">enough to do this with adults that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.010" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">truly antagonistic but if I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.109" end="00:40:52.069" style="s2">get somebody who is at that stage where</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:53.510" style="s2">they&#39;re a sponge they&#39;re drinking things</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.069" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">in and I can introduce them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.510" end="00:40:57.079" style="s2">characters ideas thoughts the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:40:58.309" style="s2">Yoda led me to the daodejing which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.079" end="00:41:00.170" style="s2">heard you talk a lot about I became</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.309" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">obsessed I self-identified as a Taoist</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.170" end="00:41:05.630" style="s2">but all because of Yoda so it was like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:07.490" style="s2">when I read the first page of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.630" end="00:41:09.980" style="s2">daodejing I was like oh my god this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.490" end="00:41:12.980" style="s2">Yoda so it was like I was so instantly</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:29.570" style="s2">and I would say the narrative warfare</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">just happen with social media this</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.570" end="00:49:29.700" style="s2">happened with fast food fast food is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">extract the most addictive things from</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.700" end="00:49:33.030" style="s2">food from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.560" style="s2">salt fat sugar mix them together in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.030" end="00:49:36.510" style="s2">right combinations and the palatability</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.560" end="00:49:37.589" style="s2">remove all the nutrients so that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.510" end="00:49:39.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even fill you up so you keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.589" end="00:49:41.940" style="s2">eating it and you you have what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.900" end="00:49:43.380" style="s2">a hyper normal stimuli right you get a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.940" end="00:49:45.180" style="s2">bigger dopamine hit from that than you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.380" end="00:49:47.550" style="s2">ever would from a salad and then the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.180" end="00:49:48.630" style="s2">salad doesn&#39;t you get no joy from where</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.550" end="00:49:52.470" style="s2">you would have before because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.630" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">actually desensitizing to normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.470" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">through normalizing hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:58.410" style="s2">which is why when you watch enough porn</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">you can&#39;t eroticized with normal women</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.410" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">right and so porn and fast food and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:07.740" style="s2">social media and are all basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:09.630" style="s2">optimizing towards hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.740" end="00:50:11.430" style="s2">because from a supply side it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.630" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">more money I maximize lifetime revenue</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.430" end="00:50:15.990" style="s2">and the people have to keep coming and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:18.150" style="s2">getting a hit and what will appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.990" end="00:50:19.470" style="s2">everybody well social media knows that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.150" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">we&#39;re social primates and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.470" end="00:50:23.940" style="s2">lonely and that what we want to spend</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:27.510" style="s2">all our time doing is looking at other</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.940" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">people&#39;s faces and like seeing other</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.510" end="00:50:30.900" style="s2">people and engaging and yet real</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:33.180" style="s2">interactions are vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.900" end="00:50:34.650" style="s2">difficult so to be able to take the part</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:36.450" style="s2">of the interaction which is where I get</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.650" end="00:50:37.980" style="s2">a like on the thing I posted and I get</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.450" end="00:50:41.010" style="s2">to see the Photoshop versions of their</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.980" end="00:50:43.290" style="s2">faces and then other limbic hijacks and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.010" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">be able to optimize for that remove all</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.290" end="00:50:47.460" style="s2">the nutrients of actual authentic human</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:49.470" style="s2">interaction that&#39;s what you get and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.460" end="00:50:51.089" style="s2">each of the new platforms that has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.470" end="00:50:52.980" style="s2">emerge in the presence of the existing</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.089" end="00:50:56.310" style="s2">platforms has to offer some new hyper</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.980" end="00:50:58.650" style="s2">normal stimuli yeah the social media is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.310" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">is something that so it&#39;s weird because</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.650" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve built my business around social</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.400" style="s2">media if you&#39;ll grant me I guess that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:07.830" style="s2">YouTube falls into the social media</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.400" end="00:51:09.780" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.830" end="00:51:11.400" style="s2">which is my primary focus but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.780" end="00:51:13.890" style="s2">rapidly become the only one that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.400" end="00:51:17.490" style="s2">really spend a lot of time on as just an</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.890" end="00:51:19.980" style="s2">individual there is something about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.490" end="00:51:22.320" style="s2">way that it the the endless scrolling</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.980" end="00:51:25.500" style="s2">like if I do it enough when I fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.320" end="00:51:28.230" style="s2">asleep I have this sense of like motion</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.500" end="00:51:30.660" style="s2">almost but like a very disquieting sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.230" end="00:51:31.740" style="s2">of motion almost like a fever dream if</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.660" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever had a fever dream that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.740" end="00:51:35.460" style="s2">just fucking loops so I was like man I</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:40.260" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t keep doing this</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.460" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">so yeah that the what is happening to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.260" end="00:51:47.970" style="s2">minds especially of kids with the change</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:50.250" style="s2">in social media like I&#39;m always wary of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.970" end="00:51:54.330" style="s2">being like you know the old fuddy-duddy</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.250" end="00:51:55.620" style="s2">who like kids today but when I the thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.330" end="00:51:59.750" style="s2">that freaks me out I want you to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.620" end="00:52:02.850" style="s2">a world with VR porn and a device that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.750" end="00:52:05.340" style="s2">moves in conjunction with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.850" end="00:52:08.100" style="s2">seeing in the VR porn that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.340" end="00:52:11.370" style="s2">affixed to the more sensitive bits that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.100" end="00:52:13.050" style="s2">you have and when I think about I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.370" end="00:52:14.910" style="s2">not kidding Daniel I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.050" end="00:52:18.030" style="s2">graduated high school certainly not with</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.910" end="00:52:21.320" style="s2">the GPA that I did I if my parents left</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.030" end="00:52:26.220" style="s2">I would have had that out so fast like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.320" end="00:52:28.590" style="s2">the when you can construct different</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.220" end="00:52:32.250" style="s2">people different partners every time</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.590" end="00:52:34.710" style="s2">that you go in like exaggerate different</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.250" end="00:52:36.150" style="s2">features like peak shift which I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.710" end="00:52:38.010" style="s2">is something that you know about like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.150" end="00:52:42.570" style="s2">you can just peek shift something until</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.010" end="00:52:46.770" style="s2">it is dysmorphic and your your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.570" end="00:52:48.120" style="s2">actually wiring to that thing and when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.770" end="00:52:49.830" style="s2">think about like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.120" end="00:52:51.270" style="s2">recommendations that I have for couples</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.050" end="00:53:10.140" style="s2">been living in a VR world that is like</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.470" end="00:53:13.050" style="s2">your brain has wired to it it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.140" end="00:53:14.220" style="s2">normalized to it and then so that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.050" end="00:53:16.020" style="s2">the first one that I sort of put my</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.220" end="00:53:17.310" style="s2">finger on it was like whew I&#39;m glad I</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:51.300" style="s2">to make good choices is it depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:52.260" style="s2">my values what I think is a good choice</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.300" end="00:59:53.850" style="s2">which you&#39;re asking about earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.260" end="00:59:56.010" style="s2">also depends upon what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.850" end="00:59:59.130" style="s2">actual reality is in the state of play</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.010" end="01:00:00.720" style="s2">and then what I think the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.130" end="01:00:01.080" style="s2">particular actions will be does it be</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.720" end="01:00:03.450" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.080" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">does it invoked our response of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.450" end="01:00:06.570" style="s2">other side that is that I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:07.830" style="s2">something against it&#39;s more intense does</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.570" end="01:00:08.460" style="s2">it create second and third order effects</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.830" end="01:00:12.450" style="s2">that are worse</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.460" end="01:00:14.760" style="s2">so like strategy 101 if you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.450" end="01:00:16.890" style="s2">factoring counter response right you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.760" end="01:00:18.600" style="s2">have a goal you whether it&#39;s black lives</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.890" end="01:00:20.190" style="s2">matter or its climate change whatever if</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.600" end="01:00:21.630" style="s2">you recognize that your goal is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.190" end="01:00:23.010" style="s2">shared by everyone and you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.630" end="01:00:24.270" style="s2">factoring counter response you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.010" end="01:00:26.340" style="s2">doing strategy you&#39;re just being</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.270" end="01:00:29.370" style="s2">emotionally hijacked into playing a game</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.340" end="01:00:30.600" style="s2">for reasons you don&#39;t even understand if</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.370" end="01:00:31.950" style="s2">you aren&#39;t factoring second and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.600" end="01:00:36.030" style="s2">third-order consequences you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.950" end="01:00:38.850" style="s2">making the world worse and so that all</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.030" end="01:00:40.380" style="s2">means you need to slow the fuck down now</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.850" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t mean inaction it means the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.380" end="01:00:44.610" style="s2">possibility of effective action now</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:45.830" style="s2">feeling effective and being effective</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.610" end="01:00:49.500" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.830" end="01:00:51.480" style="s2">truth and so people have to get off the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.500" end="01:00:54.270" style="s2">addiction of wanting to feel effective</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.480" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">and actually step back and say wait wait</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.270" end="01:00:57.480" style="s2">do I even know where what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:00:59.340" style="s2">towards do I understand the lay of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.480" end="01:01:00.690" style="s2">land do I understand the various forces</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.340" end="01:01:03.240" style="s2">and do I have a path that makes any</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.690" end="01:01:05.880" style="s2">sense at all so our ability to do choice</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.240" end="01:01:09.000" style="s2">making well depends on our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.880" end="01:01:10.890" style="s2">sense make well which is why controlling</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.000" end="01:01:13.710" style="s2">people sense making is the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.890" end="01:01:15.510" style="s2">war that&#39;s happening and the forces that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.710" end="01:01:17.670" style="s2">are said this is an important thing in</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.510" end="01:01:19.770" style="s2">terms of narrative and info warfare and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.670" end="01:01:21.420" style="s2">you asked what is power power and a game</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.770" end="01:01:25.770" style="s2">a sentence is power over other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.420" end="01:01:27.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of ways of getting it</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.770" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">some are more evil than others slavery</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.360" end="01:01:32.340" style="s2">is a particularly bad example but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:34.380" style="s2">economic servitude if I can employ you</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.340" end="01:01:36.150" style="s2">and when I&#39;m employing you you are an</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.380" end="01:01:38.130" style="s2">extension of my will you are no longer</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.150" end="01:01:39.690" style="s2">doing your own well that&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.130" end="01:01:42.090" style="s2">example of how do I get power over</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.690" end="01:01:48.170" style="s2">people to advance some goal that I have</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.090" end="01:01:50.520" style="s2">right and when we look at left-right its</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.170" end="01:01:52.080" style="s2">power of that political party to control</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.520" end="01:01:54.150" style="s2">as many people as possible to get them</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.080" end="01:01:56.190" style="s2">to vote away so there&#39;s the power over</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.150" end="01:01:58.650" style="s2">the left and right against each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.190" end="01:02:01.080" style="s2">and their power over their bases to then</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.650" end="01:02:03.060" style="s2">be able to have power as a nation over</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.080" end="01:02:04.820" style="s2">other nations and of classes over other</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.060" end="01:02:07.110" style="s2">classes and those types of things right</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.820" end="01:02:08.970" style="s2">because ultimately if I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.110" end="01:02:12.110" style="s2">other people that could do shit on my</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.970" end="01:02:14.130" style="s2">behalf I couldn&#39;t do that much stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.110" end="01:02:16.529" style="s2">like if I have to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.130" end="01:02:18.569" style="s2">with my own hands I can&#39;t do that much</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.529" end="01:02:20.460" style="s2">stuff so if I want to do more stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.569" end="01:02:25.380" style="s2">looking at how do I get more people to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.460" end="01:02:30.509" style="s2">be able to do that okay so when we start</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.380" end="01:02:32.579" style="s2">to realize that rather than try to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.509" end="01:02:34.980" style="s2">control people&#39;s behaviors directly</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.579" end="01:02:37.319" style="s2">influencing what they feel and what they</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.980" end="01:02:39.900" style="s2">think and what groups they&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.319" end="01:02:41.640" style="s2">in that will ongoingly use groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.900" end="01:02:44.369" style="s2">to affect what they think and feel is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.640" end="01:02:47.039" style="s2">much more powerful way than the brunt of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.369" end="01:02:49.940" style="s2">the warfare the power game becomes</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.039" end="01:02:53.250" style="s2">control the hearts and minds of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.940" end="01:02:58.259" style="s2">now when you&#39;re talking about making</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.250" end="01:02:59.819" style="s2">more Yoda&#39;s you aren&#39;t trying to control</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.259" end="01:03:03.329" style="s2">the hearts and minds of people to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.819" end="01:03:04.920" style="s2">your bidding you&#39;re trying to say how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.329" end="01:03:06.299" style="s2">I needs them in a direction where they</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.920" end="01:03:08.099" style="s2">will become more sovereign in</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.299" end="01:03:11.220" style="s2">self-determining as opposed to become</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.099" end="01:03:13.440" style="s2">more part of my in-group so what I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.220" end="01:03:16.829" style="s2">say is that that is trying to use the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.440" end="01:03:20.609" style="s2">tools of power to actually make the game</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.829" end="01:03:22.109" style="s2">of power less pathological which is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.609" end="01:03:25.710" style="s2">legitimate thing to do and a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.109" end="01:03:27.690" style="s2">to do typically the tools of power if if</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.710" end="01:03:29.460" style="s2">I have asymmetric power over somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.690" end="01:03:31.619" style="s2">else and I get a lot of benefit from</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.460" end="01:03:33.180" style="s2">that I have the capacity because of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.619" end="01:03:36.809" style="s2">asymmetric power to continue to get more</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.180" end="01:03:38.069" style="s2">of it and I have the motive to so any</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.809" end="01:03:39.329" style="s2">business is not just focused on</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.069" end="01:03:40.950" style="s2">providing the thing they provide but</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.329" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">increasing their capacity to do stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.950" end="01:03:44.789" style="s2">and in some places that will be Omni</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:47.220" style="s2">positive and in some places will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.789" end="01:03:49.140" style="s2">driving externalities I we celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.220" end="01:03:50.250" style="s2">because we just cornered the market</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.140" end="01:03:51.420" style="s2">which mean we drove a lot of people out</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.250" end="01:03:53.789" style="s2">of business and they can&#39;t feed their</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.420" end="01:03:54.809" style="s2">kids and we manufacture demand for</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.789" end="01:03:55.859" style="s2">people to want shit that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.809" end="01:03:57.869" style="s2">want before that doesn&#39;t actually make</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.859" end="01:04:00.809" style="s2">them happier now knowing although your</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.869" end="01:04:03.690" style="s2">logic but how do people employ this to</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.809" end="01:04:09.720" style="s2">actually make sense that makes sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.690" end="01:04:13.470" style="s2">okay understanding these things already</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.720" end="01:04:15.059" style="s2">will help that&#39;s why I was starting to</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.470" end="01:04:22.349" style="s2">bring it up when you understand more</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.059" end="01:04:24.539" style="s2">about that the as much more capacity as</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.349" end="01:04:26.819" style="s2">the top-level economic players have than</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.539" end="01:04:28.110" style="s2">you the top-level narrative players and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.819" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">information players</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.110" end="01:04:33.870" style="s2">and they&#39;re engaging in that then you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:36.930" style="s2">realize that people&#39;s minds are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.870" end="01:04:38.910" style="s2">battlefield and also the treasure that</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.930" end="01:04:42.870" style="s2">is trying to be achieved and also the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.910" end="01:04:44.520" style="s2">weapons right and so it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.870" end="01:04:46.290" style="s2">be like oh wait to what degree in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.520" end="01:04:47.580" style="s2">sovereign self-determining agent to what</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.290" end="01:04:49.800" style="s2">degree am i thinking I&#39;m a sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.580" end="01:04:50.910" style="s2">self determining agent that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.800" end="01:04:51.390" style="s2">being influenced in ways I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.910" end="01:04:53.730" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.390" end="01:04:57.240" style="s2">dude this is scary man this is like some</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.730" end="01:04:59.370" style="s2">your mind has been hijacked and you are</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.240" end="01:05:00.990" style="s2">now acting in the interest of somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.370" end="01:05:02.430" style="s2">else I don&#39;t know why but that just</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.990" end="01:05:05.580" style="s2">really hit me as you were explaining</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.430" end="01:05:08.250" style="s2">that like are my ideas my own there was</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.580" end="01:05:10.260" style="s2">a band back in the 80s called queens</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.250" end="01:05:12.530" style="s2">Reich and they were the first people</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.260" end="01:05:14.910" style="s2">that really got me to think critically</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.530" end="01:05:17.580" style="s2">so I definitely owe them a debt of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.910" end="01:05:19.830" style="s2">gratitude and they had this whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.580" end="01:05:22.710" style="s2">concept album around this guy that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.830" end="01:05:24.810" style="s2">controlling people&#39;s minds by basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.710" end="01:05:26.940" style="s2">getting them addicted and then helping</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.810" end="01:05:28.230" style="s2">them clean up but then like hey I did</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.940" end="01:05:31.260" style="s2">this for you so you&#39;re gonna do this for</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.230" end="01:05:32.550" style="s2">me it&#39;s really terrifying when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.260" end="01:05:35.010" style="s2">couple that with what you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.550" end="01:05:37.950" style="s2">about social media and how you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.010" end="01:05:39.690" style="s2">essentially groomed to push they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.950" end="01:05:41.340" style="s2">pushed you in a direction that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.690" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">started right depending on what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.340" end="01:05:45.810" style="s2">hovered over and what you clicked on</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:49.140" style="s2">like some you are very involved in this</p>

<p begin="01:05:49.140" end="01:05:53.070" style="s2">second and third-order consequence is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.370" end="01:05:56.330" style="s2">them optimizing for time on site the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.070" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">ability to leverage you to a marketer</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.330" end="01:06:03.930" style="s2">but to do that they&#39;re optimizing you in</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:06.540" style="s2">a very specific direction and that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.930" end="01:06:09.000" style="s2">is allowing either bad actor state</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.240" end="01:06:19.770" style="s2">scary like when I think about the the</p>

<p begin="01:06:19.770" end="01:06:25.320" style="s2">riots like protesting I love them all</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.320" end="01:06:27.780" style="s2">for it when it kicked off into like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.320" end="01:06:30.630" style="s2">looking out my window and seeing things</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.780" end="01:06:34.020" style="s2">burning it was like that&#39;s where I go</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.630" end="01:06:35.940" style="s2">okay like you that shit that gets really</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.020" end="01:06:37.620" style="s2">scary really fast and when you get into</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.940" end="01:06:38.820" style="s2">the weeds of like the complicated who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.620" end="01:06:41.040" style="s2">actually breaking the windows who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.820" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">actually setting the fires and</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.040" end="01:06:48.329" style="s2">the sort of swirl of very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:51.390" style="s2">parse apart things presents itself to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.329" end="01:06:53.609" style="s2">you that&#39;s where like understanding how</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.390" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">to begin to extract the information how</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.609" end="01:06:58.230" style="s2">to learn about something that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:07:01.020" style="s2">know about there was a lot of pressure</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.230" end="01:07:02.849" style="s2">to speak out and I was like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.020" end="01:07:05.640" style="s2">saying shit until I understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.849" end="01:07:07.079" style="s2">actually going on and even just going</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.640" end="01:07:08.790" style="s2">into that and beginning to realize okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.079" end="01:07:10.710" style="s2">this is a big world this is complicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.790" end="01:07:11.910" style="s2">there&#39;s there isn&#39;t a party line like</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.710" end="01:07:14.990" style="s2">it&#39;s being presented there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.910" end="01:07:16.680" style="s2">different thinkers across sort of every</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.990" end="01:07:18.060" style="s2">statement that&#39;s being made there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.680" end="01:07:22.260" style="s2">somebody that disagrees with it quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.060" end="01:07:24.630" style="s2">vehemently so my strategy for that and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.260" end="01:07:27.300" style="s2">I&#39;d be super curious to to hear what you</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.630" end="01:07:28.500" style="s2">think on this so I&#39;ve got what I what we</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.300" end="01:07:30.450" style="s2">talked about earlier the physics of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.500" end="01:07:32.400" style="s2">being human so any any data point that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.450" end="01:07:34.050" style="s2">take in has to jive with what I know is</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:37.400" style="s2">true about humans and the way the humans</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.050" end="01:07:40.410" style="s2">act and think and process and when I see</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.400" end="01:07:41.160" style="s2">people just repeating mimetic statements</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.410" end="01:07:43.380" style="s2">over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.160" end="01:07:44.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like odds are that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.380" end="01:07:47.880" style="s2">original thought for you because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.910" end="01:07:50.520" style="s2">just repeating the same thing and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.880" end="01:07:52.829" style="s2">also looking at both sides of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.520" end="01:07:56.130" style="s2">argument so it&#39;s like I know how</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.829" end="01:07:57.420" style="s2">algorithms work because as a person with</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.130" end="01:07:58.920" style="s2">a youtube channel like you have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.420" end="01:08:01.050" style="s2">understand how it works to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.920" end="01:08:03.000" style="s2">that your stuff is getting presented to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.050" end="01:08:04.470" style="s2">people so you learn real fast what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.000" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">algorithm likes what it doesn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.470" end="01:08:08.339" style="s2">learn what the algorithm is using as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:09.510" style="s2">barometer of whether this is something</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.339" end="01:08:11.010" style="s2">that should be pushed out more so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.510" end="01:08:13.619" style="s2">pay attention to that stuff so I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.010" end="01:08:14.790" style="s2">I know if I watch this type of voice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.619" end="01:08:16.650" style="s2">gonna get more of that type of voice so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.790" end="01:08:18.359" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got to actively seek out the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.650" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">other side and there&#39;s been so many</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.359" end="01:08:22.350" style="s2">times I&#39;m like whoa like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:24.239" style="s2">brilliant coming from you know side-a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.350" end="01:08:27.509" style="s2">and then wow this is brilliant coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.239" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">from side B and so it&#39;s like until I get</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.509" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">a sense of like the edges right okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:34.069" style="s2">this is edge case over here this is edge</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:36.210" style="s2">case over here now I actually understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.069" end="01:08:38.190" style="s2">filtered through what I know to be true</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.210" end="01:08:39.810" style="s2">of the way that the human mind works</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.190" end="01:08:41.640" style="s2">now I think I&#39;m beginning to understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.810" end="01:08:44.190" style="s2">this thing and I can begin to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.640" end="01:08:45.989" style="s2">try out my own ideas and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.190" end="01:08:47.790" style="s2">do then the next thing so I&#39;ve taken in</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.989" end="01:08:50.310" style="s2">all this data the next thing I do and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.790" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">my poor family one of the coolest things</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.310" end="01:08:53.850" style="s2">that come out of quarantine has been we</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:54.810" style="s2">now I do these weekly calls with</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.850" end="01:08:56.730" style="s2">different people</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.810" end="01:08:57.960" style="s2">and I try out ideas on them and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.730" end="01:08:59.580" style="s2">yeah this is how I&#39;m thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.960" end="01:09:01.800" style="s2">what do you think and I begin to realize</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.580" end="01:09:03.750" style="s2">where oh shit I thought I understood</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.800" end="01:09:06.030" style="s2">this but like my own logic is breaking</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.750" end="01:09:08.490" style="s2">down and in having to articulate it I</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.030" end="01:09:12.390" style="s2">realize sort of where the edges you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.490" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">of my ignorance are and that helps me</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.390" end="01:09:15.589" style="s2">then okay this is where I need to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:20.700" style="s2">research I need to figure this out more</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.589" end="01:09:23.370" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have a particularly useful</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.700" end="01:09:25.800" style="s2">way of going oh shit that was all false</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.370" end="01:09:29.160" style="s2">propaganda to begin with do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.800" end="01:09:30.870" style="s2">way of like are there certain outlets</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.160" end="01:09:32.970" style="s2">that you trust how do you build trust</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.870" end="01:09:44.940" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the easiest way trust</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.970" end="01:09:48.569" style="s2">around information I would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.940" end="01:09:50.220" style="s2">idea that there are any authorities that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.569" end="01:09:52.380" style="s2">I just trust enough that I can</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.220" end="01:09:55.020" style="s2">cognitively offload the process of</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.380" end="01:09:59.340" style="s2">coming to belief to them is not a real</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.020" end="01:10:01.620" style="s2">thing currently and that if you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.340" end="01:10:03.480" style="s2">about legitimate authority whether</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.620" end="01:10:04.770" style="s2">whatever scene is legitimate Authority</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.480" end="01:10:09.990" style="s2">for a while it was the Christian Church</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.770" end="01:10:11.160" style="s2">or government or then the academies and</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.990" end="01:10:14.760" style="s2">the you know the great Ivy League</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.160" end="01:10:17.340" style="s2">institutions and they&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.760" end="01:10:20.040" style="s2">the bastions of what is true what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.340" end="01:10:21.920" style="s2">fucking powerful so everyone who wants</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.040" end="01:10:24.510" style="s2">power has maximum incentive to try to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.920" end="01:10:27.060" style="s2">capture and co-opt legitimate authority</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.510" end="01:10:29.070" style="s2">towards the purposes and so you start</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.060" end="01:10:30.630" style="s2">funding the research institutes to</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.070" end="01:10:35.370" style="s2">research certain things and not others</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.630" end="01:10:37.260" style="s2">and even if so I can easily manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.370" end="01:10:39.270" style="s2">statistics to say most anything I want</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.260" end="01:10:40.650" style="s2">to I can cherry-pick that out of very</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.270" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">large data sets to say everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.650" end="01:10:44.100" style="s2">getting better everything&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:47.010" style="s2">worse or whatever it is that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.100" end="01:10:49.650" style="s2">say we can of course do false</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.010" end="01:10:53.190" style="s2">methodology in lie but we can even have</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.650" end="01:10:55.500" style="s2">information that is totally true that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.190" end="01:10:56.610" style="s2">miss representative and will guide</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.500" end="01:10:59.400" style="s2">people in the wrong direction because</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.610" end="01:11:01.740" style="s2">let&#39;s say I have a phase space of</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.400" end="01:11:03.570" style="s2">information that&#39;s all this information</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.740" end="01:11:05.640" style="s2">but I&#39;m intentionally only doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.570" end="01:11:07.750" style="s2">research on this area over here and</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.640" end="01:11:09.400" style="s2">publishing a bunch of research the pond</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.750" end="01:11:11.320" style="s2">endurance of data points to such and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.400" end="01:11:13.090" style="s2">such because there was an uneven</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.320" end="01:11:15.070" style="s2">distribution of what funded based on</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.090" end="01:11:16.740" style="s2">those dollars came from somewhere and</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.070" end="01:11:20.620" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking return on investment and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.740" end="01:11:23.110" style="s2">so certain things are going to be more</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.620" end="01:11:24.850" style="s2">useful a patentable pharma drug is going</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.110" end="01:11:26.230" style="s2">to give more research dollars than a</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.850" end="01:11:28.270" style="s2">plant-based nutrient that no one can</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.230" end="01:11:29.650" style="s2">patent to ever be able to pay the money</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.270" end="01:11:31.390" style="s2">back so the preponderance of data will</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.650" end="01:11:34.360" style="s2">say nutrients don&#39;t work as well as</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.390" end="01:11:37.390" style="s2">Harmon drugs do but the preponderance of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.360" end="01:11:40.660" style="s2">that is gibberish in that particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.390" end="01:11:42.630" style="s2">case and then also what metrics was it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.660" end="01:11:44.530" style="s2">looking at well it didn&#39;t cause any</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.630" end="01:11:46.060" style="s2">negative side effects because we look</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.530" end="01:11:47.380" style="s2">for these for side effects well the body</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.060" end="01:11:48.640" style="s2">is pretty fucking complicated you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.380" end="01:11:51.850" style="s2">cause lots of side effects that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.640" end="01:11:54.160" style="s2">outside of those few measures so as soon</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.850" end="01:11:56.620" style="s2">as you understand the process of</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.160" end="01:12:00.310" style="s2">legitimate Authority having a maximum</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.620" end="01:12:02.410" style="s2">incentive to get co-opted then you start</p>

<p begin="01:13:25.620" end="01:13:28.290" style="s2">high confidence in just acknowledging</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.180" end="01:13:31.050" style="s2">that so that&#39;s a question I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.290" end="01:13:33.300" style="s2">asking what are the knowns and what are</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.050" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">the things that we know we don&#39;t know or</p>

<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.130" style="s2">hundred percent certain right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.540" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">some Bayesian confidence margin less</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.130" end="01:13:41.610" style="s2">than 100 percent but I can say high</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:44.670" style="s2">confidence based on this process but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.610" end="01:13:46.410" style="s2">still open to new data and then here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.670" end="01:13:48.300" style="s2">the area of unknown so I want no</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.410" end="01:13:50.340" style="s2">certainty at all here because any</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.300" end="01:13:51.840" style="s2">certainty at all even a hunch can bias</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.340" end="01:13:53.640" style="s2">me in terms of what I pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.840" end="01:13:55.500" style="s2">so I just want to say I don&#39;t know do</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.640" end="01:13:58.200" style="s2">you try to eliminate even your hunches</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.500" end="01:14:02.520" style="s2">like do you all the hunches you try to</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.200" end="01:14:05.910" style="s2">what I try to run all of it I see so if</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.520" end="01:14:07.740" style="s2">I say there&#39;s a virologist who thinks or</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.910" end="01:14:09.270" style="s2">an immunologist who thinks one thing we</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.740" end="01:14:11.010" style="s2">will get immunity and someone else</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.270" end="01:14:13.860" style="s2">thinks we won&#39;t and based on different</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.010" end="01:14:16.050" style="s2">ways that they&#39;re waiting data so do I</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.860" end="01:14:17.550" style="s2">pick do I think that experts who spent</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.050" end="01:14:18.840" style="s2">thirty years studying a field more smart</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.550" end="01:14:22.110" style="s2">know things I don&#39;t that I should listen</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.840" end="01:14:23.400" style="s2">to that is different than like what a TV</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.110" end="01:14:25.710" style="s2">personality who doesn&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.400" end="01:14:29.100" style="s2">about things yes so I like will find</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.710" end="01:14:31.080" style="s2">experts who disagree but that seem</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.100" end="01:14:33.480" style="s2">earnest as opposed to seem like they are</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.080" end="01:14:35.190" style="s2">doing some piece of propaganda and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.480" end="01:14:36.780" style="s2">I like to see the dialectic where I</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.190" end="01:14:38.220" style="s2">think possible you gonna have to tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.780" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">people what a dialectic is how does it</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.220" end="01:14:46.350" style="s2">different how is it different from a</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:48.420" style="s2">debate so yeah this is important topic I</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.350" end="01:14:51.960" style="s2">saw you and Eric Weinstein discussing</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.420" end="01:14:53.940" style="s2">this a bit so dialectic is the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.960" end="01:14:55.950" style="s2">you can have a couple different</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.940" end="01:14:57.540" style="s2">perspectives that each have some truth</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.950" end="01:14:59.100" style="s2">value in them but maybe neither of which</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.540" end="01:15:01.170" style="s2">are the whole truth and they&#39;re rather</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.100" end="01:15:02.700" style="s2">than a debate where the idea is one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.170" end="01:15:04.620" style="s2">them is true one isn&#39;t and there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.700" end="01:15:06.150" style="s2">to be some kind of rhetorical warfare</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.620" end="01:15:08.910" style="s2">and then someone will be the winner at</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.150" end="01:15:10.830" style="s2">the end there&#39;s ACO exploration coming</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.910" end="01:15:12.570" style="s2">from different perspectives to see can</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.830" end="01:15:15.510" style="s2">we actually find the higher-order truth</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.570" end="01:15:17.400" style="s2">together doing this I&#39;m super obsessed</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.510" end="01:15:19.470" style="s2">with this so the the idea of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.400" end="01:15:22.020" style="s2">find a higher-order truth that this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.470" end="01:15:25.860" style="s2">you want to know what really grinds my</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.020" end="01:15:27.990" style="s2">gears the fact that do people not give a</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.860" end="01:15:30.090" style="s2">shit about what actually works like I</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.990" end="01:15:32.370" style="s2">swear to god people just want to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.090" end="01:15:34.140" style="s2">right and as somebody who used to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.370" end="01:15:35.130" style="s2">stuck in that loop I get it I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.140" end="01:15:37.770" style="s2">empathy I</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.130" end="01:15:39.150" style="s2">fucking have empathy but man everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.770" end="01:15:41.219" style="s2">in my life changed when I stopped trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.150" end="01:15:43.650" style="s2">to be right and I started saying because</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.219" end="01:15:45.270" style="s2">my thing was I was and trust me when I</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.650" end="01:15:47.639" style="s2">get the example I&#39;m about to give you is</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.270" end="01:15:49.830" style="s2">like game a to the max but when I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.639" end="01:15:52.949" style="s2">younger my focus was entirely on getting</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.830" end="01:15:54.750" style="s2">rich but I wasn&#39;t acting I wasn&#39;t acting</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.949" end="01:15:57.000" style="s2">like I wanted to get rich I was acting</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.750" end="01:15:58.650" style="s2">like I wanted to be right and so there</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.000" end="01:16:00.360" style="s2">was a day where they collided and it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.650" end="01:16:02.070" style="s2">like I was arguing for an idea in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.360" end="01:16:03.540" style="s2">business because it was mine and it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.070" end="01:16:03.989" style="s2">a voice in my head saying you know this</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.540" end="01:16:05.400" style="s2">is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.989" end="01:16:06.719" style="s2">this isn&#39;t gonna work this is gonna move</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.400" end="01:16:08.639" style="s2">the business backwards but I needed to</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.719" end="01:16:10.949" style="s2">be right and so I kept fighting for it I</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.639" end="01:16:12.690" style="s2">ended up getting my way my partner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.949" end="01:16:15.360" style="s2">left and I was like the fuck am i doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.690" end="01:16:18.570" style="s2">like I know that what I just convinced</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.360" end="01:16:20.130" style="s2">them to do will move us backwards so do</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.570" end="01:16:23.250" style="s2">I want to be right or do I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.130" end="01:16:24.750" style="s2">rich and finally I realized Jesus man if</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.250" end="01:16:26.880" style="s2">I could build my self-esteem around</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.750" end="01:16:29.460" style="s2">something else then I could actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.880" end="01:16:32.340" style="s2">achieve my goals but if I was focused on</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.460" end="01:16:33.719" style="s2">just being right that I was never going</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.340" end="01:16:36.389" style="s2">to get where I wanted to go and when I</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.719" end="01:16:39.870" style="s2">look at the screaming that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.389" end="01:16:42.900" style="s2">right now I I don&#39;t think it ends in</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.870" end="01:16:46.110" style="s2">actually improving this situation I</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.900" end="01:16:47.969" style="s2">don&#39;t think that by the rhetoric that</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.110" end="01:16:49.320" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing about like defunding cops</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.969" end="01:16:53.340" style="s2">know that that we&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.320" end="01:16:55.250" style="s2">get to the beautiful place that I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.340" end="01:16:57.389" style="s2">people want to get to so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.250" end="01:16:58.380" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be able to figure</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.389" end="01:16:59.880" style="s2">out how to actually solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.380" end="01:17:01.440" style="s2">unless somebody can propose hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.880" end="01:17:04.260" style="s2">defund the police okay Brad let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.440" end="01:17:05.460" style="s2">at that hey no this is what we need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.260" end="01:17:08.190" style="s2">do over here cool let&#39;s look at that</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.460" end="01:17:11.670" style="s2">like when you can actually stop and look</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.190" end="01:17:12.900" style="s2">at it you can get to the goal but like I</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.670" end="01:17:14.489" style="s2">said at the beginning most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.900" end="01:17:16.469" style="s2">know what their actual goal is they</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.489" end="01:17:18.630" style="s2">can&#39;t state it and then on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.469" end="01:17:20.130" style="s2">they&#39;re so worried about being right or</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.630" end="01:17:21.870" style="s2">sticking to the party line or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.130" end="01:17:24.980" style="s2">that they&#39;re they&#39;re not in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.870" end="01:17:28.800" style="s2">dialectic where you&#39;re bringing like</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.980" end="01:17:30.750" style="s2">Lincoln with his team of rivals I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.800" end="01:17:33.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s so powerful in a business I</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.750" end="01:17:36.420" style="s2">go way out of my way to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.750" end="01:17:37.770" style="s2">my team challenges my thinking that if</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.420" end="01:17:38.790" style="s2">you&#39;re an intern challenge me if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.770" end="01:17:40.949" style="s2">think I&#39;m saying something stupid</p>

<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:54.060" style="s2">be better for you you will be happier if</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.510" end="01:17:56.699" style="s2">you focus on actually getting what you</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.060" end="01:17:58.500" style="s2">want but it is it&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.699" end="01:18:01.080" style="s2">man the physics of being human</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.500" end="01:18:02.340" style="s2">by default people want to be right by</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.080" end="01:18:04.889" style="s2">default doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.340" end="01:18:07.699" style="s2">switch it up and change but Jesus by</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.889" end="01:18:10.139" style="s2">default people want to be right</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.699" end="01:18:12.270" style="s2">there&#39;s this TED talk this woman gave</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.139" end="01:18:13.860" style="s2">it&#39;s one of my favorite TED talks and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.270" end="01:18:15.510" style="s2">think it&#39;s called on being wrong it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.860" end="01:18:16.679" style="s2">a she was describing a book she had</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.510" end="01:18:18.270" style="s2">written which was studying the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.679" end="01:18:23.550" style="s2">psychology of humans experience of being</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.270" end="01:18:26.159" style="s2">wrong and she asked the audience what</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.550" end="01:18:29.250" style="s2">does it feel like to be wrong and people</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.159" end="01:18:30.810" style="s2">said embarrassing shameful whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.250" end="01:18:33.750" style="s2">she goes no that&#39;s what it feels like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.810" end="01:18:36.000" style="s2">find out you were wrong haha you like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.750" end="01:18:37.500" style="s2">be wrong is to feel right right</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.000" end="01:18:39.179" style="s2">typically where we&#39;re at we actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.500" end="01:18:41.099" style="s2">think we were right about stuff were</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.179" end="01:18:42.000" style="s2">wrong about that&#39;s instead what it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.099" end="01:18:46.770" style="s2">like as righteousness</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.000" end="01:18:48.810" style="s2">and so you were fortunate in that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.770" end="01:18:50.730" style="s2">knew you were full of shit right that</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.810" end="01:18:52.560" style="s2">was actually fortunate most people when</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.730" end="01:18:54.659" style="s2">they are righteous and adamant and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.560" end="01:18:56.280" style="s2">filled with you know passion and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.659" end="01:18:58.440" style="s2">certainty actually think they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.280" end="01:18:59.790" style="s2">that&#39;s much more dangerous because then</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.440" end="01:19:01.710" style="s2">it becomes harder to reflect on what the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.790" end="01:19:04.679" style="s2">fuck am i doing do you think they have</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.710" end="01:19:08.599" style="s2">unease or they are are there people who</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.679" end="01:19:08.599" style="s2">truly have no sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.710" end="01:19:16.679" style="s2">okay so memes live in complexes that</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.030" end="01:19:19.199" style="s2">create worldviews it are self</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.679" end="01:19:20.750" style="s2">perpetuating and self reinforcing so</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.199" end="01:19:24.320" style="s2">let&#39;s say we take a particular</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.750" end="01:19:26.429" style="s2">fundamentalist religious mean Plex and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.320" end="01:19:31.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of different ideas</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.429" end="01:19:33.150" style="s2">there&#39;s ideas about if I die in holy war</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.110" end="01:19:34.710" style="s2">then I go to heaven and there&#39;s eternal</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.150" end="01:19:36.780" style="s2">life and there&#39;s hell and so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.710" end="01:19:38.840" style="s2">both I&#39;ve got all of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.780" end="01:19:41.429" style="s2">biology on punishment motives plus</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.840" end="01:19:43.110" style="s2">reward motives plus authority motives</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.429" end="01:19:44.969" style="s2">plus the desire for certainty plus</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.110" end="01:19:47.130" style="s2">in-group stuff plus the desire to not be</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.969" end="01:19:48.869" style="s2">out grouped right it&#39;s appealing to</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.130" end="01:19:50.580" style="s2">every level of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy every</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.869" end="01:19:53.760" style="s2">emotional aspect of evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.580" end="01:19:55.530" style="s2">but then you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got core memes</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.760" end="01:19:57.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got supportive memes you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.530" end="01:19:58.739" style="s2">protector memes like a whole football</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.000" end="01:20:00.540" style="s2">team and the protector moons are</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.739" end="01:20:01.390" style="s2">anything that would fuck up believing</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.540" end="01:20:04.690" style="s2">that there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.390" end="01:20:07.480" style="s2">way to deal with it right so doubt comes</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.690" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">from the devil and will make you burn in</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.480" end="01:20:13.630" style="s2">hell forever and faith is the highest</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:16.780" style="s2">virtue which basically says critical</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.630" end="01:20:18.940" style="s2">thinking is evil and creates maximum</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.780" end="01:20:20.530" style="s2">limbic fear for you so the prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.940" end="01:20:21.730" style="s2">cortex that would try and do the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.530" end="01:20:23.770" style="s2">critical thinking will end up</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.730" end="01:20:27.100" style="s2">stimulating the amygdala to shut off the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.770" end="01:20:29.380" style="s2">prefrontal cortex and so that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.100" end="01:20:31.810" style="s2">a very neurologically advanced protector</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.380" end="01:20:33.310" style="s2">moon complex to make sure that the thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.810" end="01:20:34.630" style="s2">that could get you to question if all</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.310" end="01:20:36.580" style="s2">these beliefs are actually unfounded</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.630" end="01:20:41.590" style="s2">gibberish won&#39;t be effective against you</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.580" end="01:20:44.950" style="s2">and so most worldviews have protector</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.590" end="01:20:46.600" style="s2">means built-in and so that even if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.950" end="01:20:49.300" style="s2">feeling uncomfortable I have a way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.600" end="01:20:51.010" style="s2">rationalizing it do you</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.300" end="01:20:52.600" style="s2">so I&#39;ve heard you talk about this before</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.010" end="01:20:56.830" style="s2">and I thought this is so brilliant how</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.600" end="01:20:59.430" style="s2">do you go from Jesus saying all the</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.830" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">lovely things bringing people together</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.430" end="01:21:06.550" style="s2">to fighting the Crusades in his name</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:08.590" style="s2">like how you do the mental gymnastics do</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.550" end="01:21:11.020" style="s2">you know like what was the protector</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.590" end="01:21:13.720" style="s2">meme in that meme complex that allowed</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.020" end="01:21:15.190" style="s2">people to pull that off when the SS</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.720" end="01:21:20.950" style="s2">troupe were being tried in The Hague for</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.190" end="01:21:24.130" style="s2">war crimes after World War two I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.950" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">remember the exactly the questions were</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.130" end="01:21:28.360" style="s2">phrased but they were being asked</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:29.740" style="s2">questions to determine to try to</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.360" end="01:21:32.760" style="s2">understand the phenomena of what</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.740" end="01:21:35.740" style="s2">happened how Germany that had been very</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.760" end="01:21:37.330" style="s2">actual liberal before moved into that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.740" end="01:21:38.770" style="s2">place and also the likelihood for those</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.330" end="01:21:40.860" style="s2">people to commit similar actions again</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.770" end="01:21:42.760" style="s2">and so they were asked all the questions</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.860" end="01:21:43.720" style="s2">specific to the situation they were in</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.760" end="01:21:45.970" style="s2">but then they were asked general</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.720" end="01:21:47.430" style="s2">questions of the type did you believe</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.970" end="01:21:49.780" style="s2">everything you were doing was right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.430" end="01:21:52.600" style="s2">one of the things are so fascinating was</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.780" end="01:21:54.310" style="s2">something like 90% of the Nazi said no I</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.600" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe everything I was doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.310" end="01:21:58.210" style="s2">was right I did at the beginning when we</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:21:59.710" style="s2">were hearing about what an oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.210" end="01:22:01.540" style="s2">people we were and the bad people that</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.710" end="01:22:02.830" style="s2">were trying to oppress us and the Jews</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.540" end="01:22:04.570" style="s2">seemed to be rich when we were poor as</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.830" end="01:22:06.090" style="s2">fuck in the land Republic and had to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.570" end="01:22:08.050" style="s2">selling our kids into slavery and like</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.090" end="01:22:09.730" style="s2">it seemed like they were doing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.050" end="01:22:12.010" style="s2">consciously and we were just standing up</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.730" end="01:22:13.060" style="s2">for ourselves and so originally I did</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.010" end="01:22:13.920" style="s2">but then we started to get into places</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.060" end="01:22:16.530" style="s2">that were really fucked</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.920" end="01:22:18.060" style="s2">and so 90% of them said no I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.530" end="01:22:20.040" style="s2">think it was alright then they&#39;re asked</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.060" end="01:22:21.510" style="s2">did you ever try and stop and a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.040" end="01:22:24.960" style="s2">percent of them said no I never tried to</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.510" end="01:22:26.760" style="s2">stop and then when they were asked why</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.960" end="01:22:28.199" style="s2">they would quote German phrases that had</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.760" end="01:22:34.440" style="s2">been drilled into their heads who were</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.199" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">basically officers orders and if I if I</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.440" end="01:22:37.800" style="s2">went against this I&#39;d be putting the gas</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:39.000" style="s2">chamber and I wouldn&#39;t have made any</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.800" end="01:22:40.670" style="s2">difference like the whale saying if I</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.000" end="01:22:43.920" style="s2">don&#39;t do it somebody else will right and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.670" end="01:22:45.300" style="s2">I have my kids to deal with and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.920" end="01:22:46.500" style="s2">have the power to stop it and the and</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.300" end="01:22:50.580" style="s2">yet ninety percent of the people</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.500" end="01:22:52.710" style="s2">actually felt that way right so the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.580" end="01:22:56.130" style="s2">is true with the Inquisition&#39;s or the or</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.710" end="01:22:58.890" style="s2">the Crusades or the and it&#39;s even true</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.130" end="01:23:03.000" style="s2">today of if you grow up in a very</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.890" end="01:23:05.310" style="s2">religious area what is what happens if</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.000" end="01:23:06.540" style="s2">you give up on the religion right so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.310" end="01:23:09.750" style="s2">know what the punishment for apostasy</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.540" end="01:23:11.489" style="s2">and fundamentalist Islam is but if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.750" end="01:23:13.830" style="s2">grew up in Utah in the strict Mormon</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.489" end="01:23:15.630" style="s2">area and you give up on Mormonism then</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.830" end="01:23:17.580" style="s2">you get excommunicated depending upon</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.630" end="01:23:19.380" style="s2">how they relate to it you lose all of</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.580" end="01:23:21.630" style="s2">the benefits your in-group completely</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.380" end="01:23:23.850" style="s2">destroys maybe the idea that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.630" end="01:23:27.840" style="s2">going to lose heaven and all those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.850" end="01:23:30.030" style="s2">of things so people believe things less</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.840" end="01:23:33.179" style="s2">because they are true and more because</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.030" end="01:23:34.949" style="s2">they are useful than they realize useful</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.179" end="01:23:39.690" style="s2">and staying in the group staying in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.949" end="01:23:41.790" style="s2">good graces meeting some need mostly</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.690" end="01:23:43.590" style="s2">people believe things because it seems</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.790" end="01:23:45.030" style="s2">like it will meet some need for them or</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.590" end="01:23:47.400" style="s2">believing something else will damage</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.030" end="01:23:49.770" style="s2">that need and then they rationally</p>

<p begin="01:23:51.390" end="01:23:56.660" style="s2">they emotionally came to the belief and</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.280" end="01:23:58.500" style="s2">then they backfill epistemology so</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.660" end="01:24:00.660" style="s2">rationalizing is the opposite of being</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.500" end="01:24:05.489" style="s2">rational being rational is not starting</p>

<p begin="01:24:09.030" end="01:24:13.110" style="s2">all the hypotheses what is the evidence</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.830" end="01:24:14.850" style="s2">for all the hypotheses rationalizing is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.110" end="01:24:17.030" style="s2">I jump straight to belief and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.850" end="01:24:20.010" style="s2">going to try to create backfilled</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.030" end="01:24:23.820" style="s2">rationale for it and pretend that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.010" end="01:24:27.400" style="s2">how I got there I&#39;ll give you actually a</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.820" end="01:24:28.870" style="s2">really interesting example one</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.400" end="01:24:30.520" style="s2">the things the political left and the US</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.870" end="01:24:32.800" style="s2">likes to do is make fun of the political</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.520" end="01:24:34.330" style="s2">right for being stupid you can see this</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.800" end="01:24:37.450" style="s2">with Bill Maher or other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.330" end="01:24:39.130" style="s2">comedians and it&#39;s part of their</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.450" end="01:24:42.280" style="s2">narrative warfare strategy feeling</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.130" end="01:24:46.570" style="s2">superior through being more educated and</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.280" end="01:24:49.000" style="s2">whatever and and the political rate has</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.570" end="01:24:51.310" style="s2">it&#39;s methods of narrative warfare and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.000" end="01:24:53.560" style="s2">I&#39;m not commenting on the rightness or</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.310" end="01:24:54.790" style="s2">not of the underlying ideas but the the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.560" end="01:24:57.610" style="s2">weaponry that&#39;s genius</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.790" end="01:25:01.240" style="s2">and nobody wants to feel really stupid</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.610" end="01:25:02.860" style="s2">and so you actually stay in group by</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.240" end="01:25:04.450" style="s2">laughing at the people who are on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.860" end="01:25:06.310" style="s2">out group as opposed to defending the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.450" end="01:25:07.630" style="s2">people who are so obviously stupid that</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.310" end="01:25:09.220" style="s2">you&#39;re obviously stupid if you would</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.630" end="01:25:13.510" style="s2">even sympathize with them at all right</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.220" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s actually appealing to very not</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.510" end="01:25:20.530" style="s2">rational things in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:23.500" style="s2">desire not to seem stupid in the name of</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.530" end="01:25:29.980" style="s2">higher intellect so it&#39;s very tricky and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.500" end="01:25:31.570" style="s2">sophisticated so there&#39;s a left comedian</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.980" end="01:25:33.010" style="s2">who went to some Trump rallies recently</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.570" end="01:25:34.600" style="s2">and interviewed Trump supporters and</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.010" end="01:25:36.400" style="s2">made a compilation of how utterly stupid</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.600" end="01:25:38.170" style="s2">Trump supporters are now of course he</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.400" end="01:25:39.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t include any of the places where</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.170" end="01:25:41.620" style="s2">there Trump supporters that are well</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.820" end="01:25:43.270" style="s2">educated and have good philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.620" end="01:25:45.670" style="s2">there are other ones that will show</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.270" end="01:25:47.380" style="s2">right oriented people going to a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.670" end="01:25:49.090" style="s2">of left or and Tifa people and making</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.380" end="01:25:51.460" style="s2">them look like utter idiot so they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.090" end="01:25:52.630" style="s2">both use that tactic right so of course</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.460" end="01:25:53.950" style="s2">the first thing we have to see is as</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.630" end="01:25:55.450" style="s2">we&#39;re laughing at the dumb Trump</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.950" end="01:25:58.030" style="s2">supporters in this thing it was cherry</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.450" end="01:26:00.220" style="s2">picked for that purpose of all of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.030" end="01:26:01.600" style="s2">people to then give the sense that that</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.220" end="01:26:03.940" style="s2">was ubiquitous that they&#39;re all that</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.600" end="01:26:07.600" style="s2">done right okay so you watch the thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.940" end="01:26:10.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually impressive how much</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.600" end="01:26:11.700" style="s2">these people have rejected there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.600" end="01:26:13.330" style="s2">actually pride around</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.700" end="01:26:15.190" style="s2">anti-intellectualism within this</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.330" end="01:26:16.870" style="s2">population there&#39;s a particular part of</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.190" end="01:26:20.740" style="s2">the right that has a anti intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.870" end="01:26:23.460" style="s2">pride and so they the guy is you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.740" end="01:26:25.570" style="s2">saying very basic things about</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.460" end="01:26:28.300" style="s2">government or how bill becomes a law or</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.570" end="01:26:29.560" style="s2">whatever intentionally like showing how</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.300" end="01:26:30.850" style="s2">stupid the people are that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.560" end="01:26:32.650" style="s2">know the basics of politics and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.850" end="01:26:34.510" style="s2">certain of wrong things and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.650" end="01:26:36.610" style="s2">then tries to take it further and says</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.510" end="01:26:37.930" style="s2">if if if Trump used the n-word would you</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.610" end="01:26:40.450" style="s2">vote for him yeah I&#39;d still vote for him</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.930" end="01:26:40.690" style="s2">if he whatever and they ran different</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.450" end="01:26:42.310" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.690" end="01:26:43.719" style="s2">and at one point it said something like</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.310" end="01:26:44.980" style="s2">if Trump said that everyone need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.719" end="01:26:47.260" style="s2">start fucking pigs would you vote for</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.980" end="01:26:49.929" style="s2">him yea I&#39;d still vote for him and what</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.260" end="01:26:51.130" style="s2">it was trying to say isn&#39;t that guy who</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.929" end="01:26:54.810" style="s2">says yeah I&#39;d still vote for him is</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.130" end="01:26:58.090" style="s2">saying my mind is not open to new ideas</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.810" end="01:26:59.830" style="s2">like my mind has closed to new ideas I</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.090" end="01:27:02.170" style="s2">have already made my decision I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.830" end="01:27:05.710" style="s2">with it so you have to say what made him</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.170" end="01:27:11.020" style="s2">get there well one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.710" end="01:27:13.480" style="s2">actually insightful is he intuited in</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.020" end="01:27:14.860" style="s2">someplace that he couldn&#39;t make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.480" end="01:27:16.929" style="s2">what was going on and when the pundits</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.860" end="01:27:18.520" style="s2">were talking it was above his head and</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.929" end="01:27:22.000" style="s2">that they were trying to use</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.520" end="01:27:23.739" style="s2">intellectualism and data and statistics</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.000" end="01:27:25.000" style="s2">and whatever to say things that felt</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.739" end="01:27:26.710" style="s2">like they were gonna fuck his world up</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.000" end="01:27:29.679" style="s2">that weren&#39;t in his interest right that</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.710" end="01:27:32.710" style="s2">seemed against his interest and so he</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.679" end="01:27:34.989" style="s2">basically said I know my mind he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.710" end="01:27:38.110" style="s2">this sophisticated but subconsciously I</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.989" end="01:27:39.850" style="s2">know my mind is a battleground of people</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.110" end="01:27:42.250" style="s2">more sophisticated than me who are gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.850" end="01:27:43.630" style="s2">try to convince me what is true but I</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.250" end="01:27:46.210" style="s2">don&#39;t think they have my interest in</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.630" end="01:27:47.980" style="s2">mind so this Trump guy it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.210" end="01:27:49.900" style="s2">if it&#39;s true or not I actually feel</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.980" end="01:27:53.110" style="s2">safer being on his side in a world that</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.900" end="01:27:55.139" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s in more he feels more</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.110" end="01:27:59.590" style="s2">like me and he feels like he might win</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.139" end="01:28:02.980" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want the susceptibility of</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.590" end="01:28:04.420" style="s2">people trying to confuse me to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.980" end="01:28:06.969" style="s2">possible so it&#39;s very interesting to see</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.420" end="01:28:10.980" style="s2">how the that anti intellectual thing was</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.969" end="01:28:13.090" style="s2">actually a compensating weapon of</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.980" end="01:28:14.469" style="s2">intellectual weapons being used to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.090" end="01:28:16.860" style="s2">control people in ways that they could</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.469" end="01:28:19.389" style="s2">tell weren&#39;t fully in their interest</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.860" end="01:28:23.409" style="s2">that that&#39;s really interesting and this</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.389" end="01:28:27.159" style="s2">is where cognitive distribution to make</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.409" end="01:28:29.139" style="s2">it sound fancy the fact that sadly not</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.159" end="01:28:32.110" style="s2">all mines are created equal it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.139" end="01:28:33.760" style="s2">man when you have like when I look at</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.110" end="01:28:38.199" style="s2">people that are clearly smarter than me</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.760" end="01:28:41.830" style="s2">I&#39;m just like dude this is deeply</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.199" end="01:28:43.360" style="s2">problematic to try to make sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.830" end="01:28:47.139" style="s2">they&#39;re saying and to engage with what</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.360" end="01:28:49.090" style="s2">they&#39;re saying it is I get it man I feel</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.139" end="01:28:50.650" style="s2">for people when it it you you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.090" end="01:28:52.900" style="s2">you&#39;re being moved around the board like</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.650" end="01:28:54.099" style="s2">a chess piece and you&#39;re not sure like</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.900" end="01:28:55.810" style="s2">where the trap is coming</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.099" end="01:28:57.849" style="s2">but you know that there is a trap coming</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.810" end="01:29:00.570" style="s2">and hold on one second because I have an</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.849" end="01:29:00.570" style="s2">alarm going off</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.340" end="01:29:18.119" style="s2">all right sorry about that I am normally</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:20.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t film this late so I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.119" end="01:29:22.530" style="s2">think to check my bad</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.639" end="01:29:25.230" style="s2">so yeah when you&#39;ve got somebody that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.530" end="01:29:26.340" style="s2">just you know outperforming you and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.230" end="01:29:28.520" style="s2">can feel that you&#39;re being moved around</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.340" end="01:29:31.710" style="s2">that chess board it is so disconcerting</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.520" end="01:29:35.130" style="s2">that I can see how people would end up</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.710" end="01:29:37.920" style="s2">shutting down and so this is why we like</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.130" end="01:29:40.110" style="s2">debates as we think okay that guy is</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.920" end="01:29:41.760" style="s2">saying something that I seem to disagree</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.110" end="01:29:44.790" style="s2">with but he&#39;s smarter than me I want to</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.760" end="01:29:47.400" style="s2">put my smart or candidate up to battle</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.790" end="01:29:50.610" style="s2">with him right and the higher angel of</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.400" end="01:29:53.070" style="s2">our nature is wanting to actually</p>

<p begin="01:29:54.360" end="01:29:57.090" style="s2">with the counters that we wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.530" end="01:29:59.760" style="s2">known the lower angels of our nature is</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.090" end="01:30:02.070" style="s2">just watching a dog fight and that&#39;s why</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.530" end="01:31:05.040" style="s2">learned very early on that by putting</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.040" end="01:31:08.790" style="s2">time and energy into getting good at the</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.040" end="01:31:11.760" style="s2">performative layer of a talk mm made a</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.790" end="01:31:13.230" style="s2">huge difference and so when I was young</p>

<p begin="01:31:22.110" end="01:31:26.310" style="s2">a little it&#39;s exciting when you</p>

<p begin="01:31:26.310" end="01:31:30.170" style="s2">right reasons but it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.020" end="01:31:34.800" style="s2">unnerving when I think about like</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.170" end="01:31:36.210" style="s2">charisma goes a long way man just by the</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.800" end="01:31:37.380" style="s2">way that you make somebody feel they</p>

<p begin="01:31:45.300" end="01:31:49.530" style="s2">of the core friction of my life is I</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.970" end="01:31:52.650" style="s2">have what I call a two-hour declining</p>

<p begin="01:31:56.910" end="01:32:01.260" style="s2">something I can be very persuasive when</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.820" end="01:32:02.580" style="s2">I really believe in something and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.260" end="01:32:05.040" style="s2">really passionate because I can bring</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.580" end="01:32:06.300" style="s2">that out and I can energy infects other</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.040" end="01:32:07.530" style="s2">people and so you can infect them with</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.300" end="01:32:10.170" style="s2">your enthusiasm you can get them hyped</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.530" end="01:32:12.690" style="s2">up but as soon as I walk away it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.170" end="01:32:13.890" style="s2">it that sense of like because I try to</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.690" end="01:32:15.540" style="s2">give people the sense that they can do</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.890" end="01:32:16.800" style="s2">it right whatever it is like you can do</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.540" end="01:32:19.380" style="s2">it you can make it come true and let me</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.800" end="01:32:21.810" style="s2">tell you and I know that when I walk</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.380" end="01:32:24.750" style="s2">away that feeling begins to wane and so</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.810" end="01:32:27.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you get beyond just the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.750" end="01:32:29.040" style="s2">the ability to whip people into an</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.180" end="01:32:31.590" style="s2">emotional frenzy and actually get them</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.040" end="01:32:33.090" style="s2">to think critically to form an opinion</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.590" end="01:32:34.440" style="s2">to say okay I actually think I</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.090" end="01:32:36.750" style="s2">understand how these pieces work</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.440" end="01:32:38.310" style="s2">together and then it&#39;s like you can</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.750" end="01:32:40.640" style="s2">begin to form your own opinion then you</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.310" end="01:32:44.040" style="s2">can you know how to move to a world but</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.640" end="01:32:46.650" style="s2">otherwise how to do that for your</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.040" end="01:32:49.800" style="s2">listeners right now how to please how</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.650" end="01:32:52.020" style="s2">because similar this conversation might</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.800" end="01:32:54.660" style="s2">have some impact on them for like a day</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.020" end="01:32:55.860" style="s2">maybe right but the moment they have</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.660" end="01:32:58.170" style="s2">scrolled their Facebook feed they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.860" end="01:33:02.940" style="s2">forgotten about it and they&#39;re now fully</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.170" end="01:33:04.650" style="s2">inundated with other things and so how</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.940" end="01:33:08.790" style="s2">why would why do we bother doing this at</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.650" end="01:33:10.170" style="s2">all so if someone is feeling a</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.790" end="01:33:11.550" style="s2">particular kind of resonance and</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.170" end="01:33:14.310" style="s2">inspiration they have to take some</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.550" end="01:33:17.730" style="s2">actions it will keep it feeding or</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.310" end="01:33:19.500" style="s2">nurturing that and so let&#39;s talk about a</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.730" end="01:33:21.660" style="s2">few things people can do because when</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.500" end="01:33:22.860" style="s2">you&#39;re in the room with them whether</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.660" end="01:33:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just that you&#39;re giving them better</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.860" end="01:33:26.430" style="s2">information or you&#39;re emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.840" end="01:33:30.240" style="s2">influencing them they&#39;re influenced by</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.430" end="01:33:31.410" style="s2">what they&#39;re around and so if some but</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.240" end="01:33:33.270" style="s2">then when you leave they&#39;re influenced</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.410" end="01:33:34.980" style="s2">by whatever they&#39;re around next what</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.270" end="01:33:35.560" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is make them have</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.980" end="01:33:37.780" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.560" end="01:33:40.660" style="s2">a internal locus of control to be more</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.780" end="01:33:43.420" style="s2">self influencing well the the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.660" end="01:33:47.140" style="s2">influence I would say illegitimate power</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.420" end="01:33:49.270" style="s2">in a game be sense illegitimate power is</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.140" end="01:33:52.750" style="s2">where I&#39;m trying to influence people</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.270" end="01:33:54.790" style="s2">towards my agenda perpetually legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.750" end="01:33:59.140" style="s2">power is where I&#39;m trying to influence</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.790" end="01:34:01.210" style="s2">them to be more self directing which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.140" end="01:34:03.250" style="s2">basically what a good parent or a</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.210" end="01:34:04.720" style="s2">teacher is trying to do is to increase</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.250" end="01:34:06.490" style="s2">someone&#39;s capacity to make their own</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.720" end="01:34:10.300" style="s2">good sense making their own good</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.490" end="01:34:11.590" style="s2">decisions and whereas to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.300" end="01:34:13.360" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to convince them what to</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.590" end="01:34:16.990" style="s2">think that aligns with an agenda I have</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.360" end="01:34:18.670" style="s2">that is a you know game theoretic thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.990" end="01:34:19.780" style="s2">that will then produce counter responses</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.670" end="01:34:26.260" style="s2">of other people who want to convince</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.780" end="01:34:30.180" style="s2">some of some other thing but as people</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.260" end="01:34:30.180" style="s2">are seeking to become more</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.240" end="01:34:35.530" style="s2">self-determined the first thing is to</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.850" end="01:34:37.750" style="s2">recognize how much you are not self</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.530" end="01:34:39.430" style="s2">determined to recognize how much the</p>

<p begin="01:34:40.570" end="01:34:44.680" style="s2">influences and start changing that one</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.360" end="01:34:46.720" style="s2">of the best acts of self-determination</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.680" end="01:34:49.990" style="s2">is to change the things other than you</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.720" end="01:34:51.610" style="s2">that are influencing you and so we</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.990" end="01:34:54.820" style="s2">talked about the problem of social media</p>

<p begin="01:36:11.890" end="01:36:16.210" style="s2">thing I I&#39;m really obsessed with this</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.230" end="01:36:18.400" style="s2">idea I want people to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.210" end="01:36:21.270" style="s2">what I normally say is skills have</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.400" end="01:36:23.410" style="s2">utility but information has utility and</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.270" end="01:36:25.810" style="s2">man I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.410" end="01:36:27.910" style="s2">from where on the political spectrum an</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.810" end="01:36:29.650" style="s2">idea comes from if it&#39;s real if it has</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.910" end="01:36:32.140" style="s2">real-world implications and it lets me</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.650" end="01:36:35.020" style="s2">move towards a goal that I have I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.140" end="01:36:37.720" style="s2">gonna take it and I actually cannot</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.020" end="01:36:40.930" style="s2">understand anything else</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.720" end="01:36:43.900" style="s2">so it&#39;s there they&#39;re powerful I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.930" end="01:36:45.250" style="s2">this all came for me because of building</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.900" end="01:36:48.340" style="s2">businesses like when your house is on</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.250" end="01:36:49.930" style="s2">the line you don&#39;t have time to worry</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.340" end="01:36:51.280" style="s2">about whether you thought of the idea or</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.930" end="01:36:52.570" style="s2">somebody else thought of the idea or</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.280" end="01:36:53.710" style="s2">somebody you like thought of it or</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.570" end="01:36:55.660" style="s2">somebody you don&#39;t like thought of it</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.710" end="01:36:56.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just like Jesus dude I don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.660" end="01:36:58.090" style="s2">have to go home and tell my wife that we</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.860" end="01:37:00.220" style="s2">have to move out because we&#39;d lost the</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.090" end="01:37:03.100" style="s2">house like that was such a real thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.220" end="01:37:04.660" style="s2">for me and that kicked me into just a</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.100" end="01:37:06.460" style="s2">and I had already been sort of marching</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.660" end="01:37:08.620" style="s2">down that path but that kicked me into a</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.460" end="01:37:10.090" style="s2">whole nother level of like I just need</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.620" end="01:37:11.950" style="s2">to know what works man I need to know</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.090" end="01:37:13.060" style="s2">what works I have a goal I need to know</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.950" end="01:37:17.680" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna move me towards that goal</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.060" end="01:37:19.810" style="s2">and it also it felt better like there</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.680" end="01:37:21.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of relaxing because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.810" end="01:37:23.170" style="s2">not trying to posture I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.340" end="01:37:24.790" style="s2">campaign I used to say all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.170" end="01:37:25.900" style="s2">unfortunately I was wrong about this but</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.790" end="01:37:27.880" style="s2">I used to say all the time to people</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.900" end="01:37:29.290" style="s2">just be good because you can&#39;t campaign</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.880" end="01:37:31.480" style="s2">and convince people that you&#39;re good now</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.290" end="01:37:32.920" style="s2">the sad reality is you actually can you</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.480" end="01:37:36.640" style="s2">can bamboozle a lot of fucking people</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.920" end="01:37:39.340" style="s2">with a lot of words but being good</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.640" end="01:37:42.040" style="s2">itself is gonna take you a lot farther</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.340" end="01:37:44.980" style="s2">and the getting people interested in</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.040" end="01:37:47.950" style="s2">that like gamifying in themselves like</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.980" end="01:37:49.720" style="s2">okay cool I want this curated feed that</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.950" end="01:37:53.530" style="s2">is bringing me a diverse array of</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.720" end="01:37:55.960" style="s2">opinions so that I can actually function</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.530" end="01:37:57.370" style="s2">and if people got into that idea of</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.960" end="01:38:00.580" style="s2">functioning but the goal here is to</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.370" end="01:38:02.600" style="s2">function it&#39;s to actually be useful to</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.580" end="01:38:04.520" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.600" end="01:38:05.900" style="s2">so I define power very differently than</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.520" end="01:38:07.250" style="s2">you but the way that I define power and</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.900" end="01:38:09.650" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just the wrong word at least</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.250" end="01:38:11.390" style="s2">for this conversation is power is being</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.650" end="01:38:13.070" style="s2">able to close your eyes imagine a world</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.390" end="01:38:14.840" style="s2">better than this one open your eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.070" end="01:38:19.160" style="s2">actually have the skills to move towards</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.840" end="01:38:23.000" style="s2">that to make that real and I have become</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.160" end="01:38:25.190" style="s2">so obsessed with that idea that it helps</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.000" end="01:38:26.690" style="s2">like that becomes almost the filter by</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.190" end="01:38:28.700" style="s2">which I make sense of the world like if</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.690" end="01:38:30.140" style="s2">I really think about like what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.700" end="01:38:31.880" style="s2">one of my highest level filters it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.140" end="01:38:35.600" style="s2">like I only do and believe that which</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.880" end="01:38:37.820" style="s2">moves me towards my goals and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.600" end="01:38:40.010" style="s2">good at choosing your goal then you</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.820" end="01:38:41.960" style="s2">suddenly become open to any good idea</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.010" end="01:38:43.580" style="s2">from wherever even if it contradicts</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.960" end="01:38:45.380" style="s2">like I came into it thinking one thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.580" end="01:38:47.720" style="s2">but like whoa that&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.380" end="01:38:48.980" style="s2">that&#39;s real that&#39;s actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.720" end="01:38:51.920" style="s2">take me it&#39;s not something I ever</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.980" end="01:38:53.420" style="s2">thought like I never thought that and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.920" end="01:38:55.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about game B to know</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.420" end="01:38:57.860" style="s2">if like I&#39;m behind it or not but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.970" end="01:38:59.840" style="s2">like hey if game B ends up being the</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.860" end="01:39:02.810" style="s2">most real thing and there is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.840" end="01:39:04.870" style="s2">deal with the just freakish amount of</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.810" end="01:39:07.160" style="s2">complexity and that we actually can</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.870" end="01:39:12.170" style="s2">consciously build something that moves</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.160" end="01:39:13.720" style="s2">us towards that and it becomes a my</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.170" end="01:39:16.250" style="s2">values would definitely be</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.720" end="01:39:18.230" style="s2">sustainability human well-being</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.250" end="01:39:21.590" style="s2">like those are sort of inextricably</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.230" end="01:39:24.220" style="s2">connected wanting the human race to go</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.590" end="01:39:26.600" style="s2">on long after I&#39;m here wanting people to</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.220" end="01:39:29.240" style="s2">struggle but struggle well so that they</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.600" end="01:39:31.160" style="s2">can be tough and be resilient like those</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.240" end="01:39:33.710" style="s2">are all things that to me seem</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.160" end="01:39:34.880" style="s2">inherently good more than say happiness</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.710" end="01:39:39.890" style="s2">or something like that which is very</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.880" end="01:39:41.930" style="s2">transient but like seeking out the</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.890" end="01:39:44.330" style="s2">things that will actually get me there</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.930" end="01:39:46.100" style="s2">and the process of iteration and at the</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.330" end="01:39:48.140" style="s2">risk of just completely derailed on</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.100" end="01:39:50.480" style="s2">tangents here that to me that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.140" end="01:39:54.380" style="s2">mixture of like iterate get it out there</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.480" end="01:39:55.490" style="s2">try be sincere in the pursuit of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.380" end="01:39:58.370" style="s2">actually going to move you towards your</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.490" end="01:39:59.990" style="s2">goal like that is you know if I had</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.370" end="01:40:02.030" style="s2">magic fairy dust that could sprinkle on</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.990" end="01:40:04.520" style="s2">people to get them to act in accordance</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.030" end="01:40:07.820" style="s2">with that I think they would be happier</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.520" end="01:40:09.170" style="s2">and it certainly would lead to a better</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.820" end="01:40:11.630" style="s2">world in my estimation this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.170" end="01:40:14.470" style="s2">interesting and at the risk of opening a</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.630" end="01:40:14.470" style="s2">very big can of worms</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.560" end="01:40:19.820" style="s2">did do I remember right that you said</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.870" end="01:40:21.710" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t necessarily true that</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.820" end="01:40:31.010" style="s2">improving the individual will improve</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.710" end="01:40:33.440" style="s2">Society or am i miss remembering that it</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.010" end="01:40:35.450" style="s2">is not necessarily true that improving</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.440" end="01:40:41.180" style="s2">some subset of individuals in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.450" end="01:40:43.640" style="s2">particular way will improve society like</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.180" end="01:40:45.020" style="s2">okay someone getting better at violin is</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.640" end="01:40:50.410" style="s2">improving them it&#39;s improving their</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.020" end="01:40:55.400" style="s2">skills someone getting better at warfare</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.410" end="01:40:58.130" style="s2">is improving their skills so is society</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.400" end="01:41:00.830" style="s2">the result of the quality of the members</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.130" end="01:41:02.450" style="s2">yes but are the members also the result</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.830" end="01:41:04.100" style="s2">of the quality of the civilization</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.450" end="01:41:05.630" style="s2">systems like the education and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.100" end="01:41:06.950" style="s2">economics and the culture and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.630" end="01:41:09.740" style="s2">governance that help condition and</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.950" end="01:41:12.830" style="s2">develop them also yes so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.740" end="01:41:14.480" style="s2">bottom up individuals to society or just</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.830" end="01:41:15.710" style="s2">top down the quality of a society of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.480" end="01:41:21.560" style="s2">oak&#39;s different things from individuals</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.710" end="01:41:24.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a recursion there so I but I</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.560" end="01:41:25.370" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s a tangent there I</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.020" end="01:41:27.980" style="s2">doing that go down I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.370" end="01:41:29.690" style="s2">something you said a moment ago when you</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.980" end="01:41:32.270" style="s2">were talking about the desire to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.690" end="01:41:35.780" style="s2">right and how problematic that was and</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.270" end="01:41:41.150" style="s2">when you let that go you go in that way</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.780" end="01:41:43.370" style="s2">makes you very easy to control because</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.150" end="01:41:44.810" style="s2">all I have to do is appeal to your</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.370" end="01:41:48.140" style="s2">desire to feel right and I can control</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.810" end="01:41:50.000" style="s2">you I can give you information that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.140" end="01:41:52.220" style="s2">have taken more time than you have the</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.000" end="01:41:53.960" style="s2">process to frame it up that will make</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.220" end="01:41:56.900" style="s2">you feel right and I can do pick what</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.960" end="01:41:58.520" style="s2">you believe I can also inflame you into</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.900" end="01:42:01.190" style="s2">emotion by attacking your sense of</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.520" end="01:42:04.280" style="s2">rightness or whatever so having a</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.190" end="01:42:05.780" style="s2">fragile ego that wants to seem right and</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.280" end="01:42:07.520" style="s2">that is fragile II identified with</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.780" end="01:42:10.730" style="s2">certain positions makes you very very</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.520" end="01:42:13.510" style="s2">vulnerable to control so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.730" end="01:42:17.960" style="s2">important thing having a mindset where</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.510" end="01:42:19.790" style="s2">anything can be brought up and your</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.960" end="01:42:21.740" style="s2">identities not attached to specific</p>

<p begin="01:42:23.930" end="01:42:28.300" style="s2">of it makes you much more resilient</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.340" end="01:42:34.730" style="s2">yeah resiliency is is one of those</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.540" end="01:42:37.070" style="s2">things from an intrinsic standpoint that</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.730" end="01:42:38.570" style="s2">if people want that in themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.070" end="01:42:42.680" style="s2">they&#39;re actually willing to put that to</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.570" end="01:42:46.670" style="s2">use you can begin to get anti fragile</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.680" end="01:42:49.730" style="s2">and anti fragility in terms of building</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.670" end="01:42:51.590" style="s2">a new society I know is a is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.730" end="01:42:54.200" style="s2">a pretty important thing do you think</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.590" end="01:42:56.360" style="s2">that we have any ideas that could</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.200" end="01:42:57.350" style="s2">actually cause so antifragility for</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.360" end="01:42:59.060" style="s2">anybody that&#39;s never heard the phrase</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.350" end="01:43:03.050" style="s2">before the more you attack it the</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.060" end="01:43:05.420" style="s2">stronger it becomes so what on earth</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.050" end="01:43:07.130" style="s2">would that look like at the societal</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.420" end="01:43:13.010" style="s2">level I I it is a failure of imagination</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.130" end="01:43:17.990" style="s2">for me I can&#39;t imagine it capitalism has</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.010" end="01:43:25.010" style="s2">been anti-federal as a system of</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.990" end="01:43:29.240" style="s2">resource distribution and etc it it has</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.010" end="01:43:34.370" style="s2">continued to evolve its capacities so we</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.240" end="01:43:37.580" style="s2">went from say barter to exchange</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.370" end="01:43:39.470" style="s2">mediated by currency to fiat currency to</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.580" end="01:43:43.340" style="s2">fractional reserve vehicles the attacks</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.470" end="01:43:48.170" style="s2">upon it that made it stronger well if</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.340" end="01:43:49.850" style="s2">one capitalist group say another nation</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.170" end="01:43:51.830" style="s2">or whatever was trying to advance their</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.850" end="01:43:53.870" style="s2">overall share of the pie relative to</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.830" end="01:43:55.100" style="s2">another one they kept each strengthening</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.870" end="01:43:57.530" style="s2">their underlying capitalist base</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.100" end="01:44:01.250" style="s2">becoming better at extraction exchange</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.530" end="01:44:03.230" style="s2">those types of things when communism was</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.250" end="01:44:06.170" style="s2">emerging as an alternate system it</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.230" end="01:44:08.540" style="s2">increased its capacity to be productive</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.170" end="01:44:10.970" style="s2">and defend itself and whatever so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.540" end="01:44:12.650" style="s2">an example of antifragility you were</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.970" end="01:44:15.560" style="s2">asking earlier how does someone go from</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.650" end="01:44:17.830" style="s2">the forgiveness of Jesus to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.560" end="01:44:20.990" style="s2">Crusades there was a belief system</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.830" end="01:44:23.330" style="s2">Christianity they continued to get</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.990" end="01:44:24.860" style="s2">stronger and buy stronger it meant as it</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.330" end="01:44:29.000" style="s2">was attacked by other religious</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.860" end="01:44:32.060" style="s2">ideologies or or political ideologies it</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.000" end="01:44:33.380" style="s2">was increasing its and this actually</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.060" end="01:44:34.970" style="s2">interesting because anti fragile is not</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.380" end="01:44:37.970" style="s2">always good because sometimes it just</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.970" end="01:44:40.360" style="s2">means the thing is getting better at</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.970" end="01:44:40.360" style="s2">warfare</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.360" end="01:44:48.790" style="s2">I actually want to bring up the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.190" end="01:44:53.600" style="s2">campaign has elements of antifragility</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.790" end="01:44:57.800" style="s2">so whether it was stormy Daniels or the</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.600" end="01:45:00.350" style="s2">Russia issue or the impeachment his base</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.800" end="01:45:02.510" style="s2">actually got stronger through each of</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.350" end="01:45:05.179" style="s2">those and so one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.510" end="01:45:06.860" style="s2">left has not recognized they failed to</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.179" end="01:45:09.050" style="s2">recognize the antifragility and that</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.860" end="01:45:12.159" style="s2">they were lobbying attacks that would</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.050" end="01:45:14.869" style="s2">lose but would actually strengthen and</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.159" end="01:45:16.100" style="s2">so that&#39;s such an important thing to</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.869" end="01:45:17.360" style="s2">recognize because if something has</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.100" end="01:45:18.739" style="s2">become antique red jewel and you think</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.360" end="01:45:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s bad you&#39;re going against it you</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.739" end="01:45:24.739" style="s2">have to think in a different way and</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.400" end="01:45:26.119" style="s2">actually I&#39;ll use Trump as an example</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.739" end="01:45:33.409" style="s2">here the thing you were mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.119" end="01:45:38.150" style="s2">around listening to diverse opinions so</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.409" end="01:45:39.679" style="s2">we we know that he&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.150" end="01:45:42.530" style="s2">president and the politically trained</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.679" end="01:45:45.080" style="s2">ones that have been there before whether</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.530" end="01:45:46.850" style="s2">people think that he is saving the</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.080" end="01:45:49.250" style="s2">nation from the corrupt evil deep state</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.850" end="01:45:51.800" style="s2">or whether he is destroying it to create</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.250" end="01:45:53.570" style="s2">his own evil dynasty is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.800" end="01:45:54.590" style="s2">classically polarized things that people</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.570" end="01:45:56.420" style="s2">have a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.590" end="01:45:57.949" style="s2">grounding enough they grounded in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.420" end="01:46:00.830" style="s2">thing that resonates is true to them</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.949" end="01:46:02.449" style="s2">without seeing the other things but I</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.830" end="01:46:06.290" style="s2">think everyone knows he&#39;s been effective</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.449" end="01:46:08.960" style="s2">at a particular thing I know a couple</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.290" end="01:46:10.760" style="s2">people who have been who worked with him</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.960" end="01:46:13.369" style="s2">closely been on the Security Council or</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.760" end="01:46:14.420" style="s2">you know in his advisory board who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.369" end="01:46:16.010" style="s2">said the same thing about their</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.420" end="01:46:18.230" style="s2">experience working with him in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.010" end="01:46:20.409" style="s2">presidential or what said one same thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.230" end="01:46:23.139" style="s2">and I found very interesting is that</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.409" end="01:46:25.719" style="s2">where most of the president&#39;s previously</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.139" end="01:46:28.369" style="s2">had positions that were fairly</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.719" end="01:46:30.080" style="s2">consistent and predictable Bush did kind</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.369" end="01:46:32.270" style="s2">of Bush things and Obama did kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.080" end="01:46:34.219" style="s2">Obama things and they got people around</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.270" end="01:46:35.989" style="s2">them that had a similar ideology and</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.219" end="01:46:37.400" style="s2">that had for some period of time right</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.989" end="01:46:38.869" style="s2">the Obama Democrats before they were</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.400" end="01:46:40.400" style="s2">Obama Democrats were Clinton Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.869" end="01:46:44.330" style="s2">they were of a certain type and same in</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.400" end="01:46:48.050" style="s2">Bush Republicans Trump got people who</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.330" end="01:46:49.610" style="s2">were mostly not of that of a particular</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.050" end="01:46:51.110" style="s2">lineage system and he got people who</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.610" end="01:46:55.280" style="s2">disagreed with each other via mentally</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.110" end="01:46:57.200" style="s2">and so if he would bring</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.280" end="01:46:59.150" style="s2">at Reyes into a room and Bannon into a</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.200" end="01:47:00.980" style="s2">room together to talk about China</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.150" end="01:47:02.930" style="s2">because they both knew more about it</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.980" end="01:47:06.980" style="s2">than he didn&#39;t he knew that but they</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.930" end="01:47:08.840" style="s2">disagreed vehemently then what they what</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.980" end="01:47:11.120" style="s2">I was told would happen in the room is</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.840" end="01:47:12.950" style="s2">that he would invite a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.120" end="01:47:14.720" style="s2">in without giving them any events notice</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.950" end="01:47:16.310" style="s2">of what they were going to talk about so</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.720" end="01:47:18.200" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t prepare how to manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.310" end="01:47:20.390" style="s2">while thinking so he got their</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.200" end="01:47:21.980" style="s2">extemporaneous real sense he brought in</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.390" end="01:47:23.690" style="s2">people who disagreed he would ask a</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.980" end="01:47:25.520" style="s2">question without giving an indication of</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.690" end="01:47:27.140" style="s2">what he thought he&#39;d keep a poker face</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.520" end="01:47:29.330" style="s2">on the whole time to not indicate that</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.140" end="01:47:30.560" style="s2">what he believed and you just keep</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.330" end="01:47:32.870" style="s2">asking questions and have them fight it</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.560" end="01:47:34.220" style="s2">out and and he would actually sit there</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.870" end="01:47:37.820" style="s2">quietly and listen for a couple hours</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.220" end="01:47:38.990" style="s2">and once he had heard enough then he</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.820" end="01:47:42.200" style="s2">still wouldn&#39;t tell them what he thought</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.990" end="01:47:43.730" style="s2">he&#39;d go straight to Twitter because he</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.200" end="01:47:45.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t care if they agreed with him or</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.730" end="01:47:46.490" style="s2">not he cared of his support base did and</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.410" end="01:47:47.810" style="s2">Twitter gave him an innocent way to</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.490" end="01:47:50.120" style="s2">communicate with the support base and</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.810" end="01:47:52.040" style="s2">get real-time analytics based on the big</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.120" end="01:47:54.230" style="s2">data analysis of the Twitter feed of</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.040" end="01:47:57.650" style="s2">whether what he was saying was</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.230" end="01:48:01.100" style="s2">coalescing his support base or not Wow</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.650" end="01:48:03.110" style="s2">and so that is an effective technology</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.100" end="01:48:04.430" style="s2">where what he&#39;s doing is listening to</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.110" end="01:48:06.650" style="s2">different viewpoints now he was</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.430" end="01:48:07.940" style="s2">listening for is not necessarily what is</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.650" end="01:48:12.110" style="s2">true but will be effective for</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.940" end="01:48:14.660" style="s2">coalescing my support base but he also</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.110" end="01:48:16.670" style="s2">had much more direct communication with</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.660" end="01:48:18.410" style="s2">people and much faster feedback now also</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.670" end="01:48:19.940" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have a position kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.410" end="01:48:21.380" style="s2">like Bruce Lee said about martial arts</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.940" end="01:48:24.050" style="s2">right when you don&#39;t have a fixed form</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.380" end="01:48:26.060" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have rigorous positions</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.050" end="01:48:27.680" style="s2">you can take the position that is</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.060" end="01:48:29.450" style="s2">coalescing the support base empirical</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.680" end="01:48:30.950" style="s2">more which is both terrible and</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.450" end="01:48:38.090" style="s2">wonderful depending upon what your whole</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.950" end="01:48:40.010" style="s2">is woo man so yeah this is I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.090" end="01:48:42.140" style="s2">not surprised by this conversation given</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.010" end="01:48:44.720" style="s2">that you are the person I came across</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.140" end="01:48:48.680" style="s2">when researching the end of the world</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.720" end="01:48:52.420" style="s2">and how civilizations crumble dude the</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.680" end="01:48:54.290" style="s2">way that you are taking the entire</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.420" end="01:48:56.540" style="s2">ecosystem of things that have to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.290" end="01:48:58.400" style="s2">taken into consideration into</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.540" end="01:48:59.990" style="s2">consideration it is it is very</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.400" end="01:49:04.880" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m gonna be watching you</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.990" end="01:49:06.980" style="s2">very carefully with what you continue to</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.880" end="01:49:08.420" style="s2">put out in terms of game be and how we</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.980" end="01:49:08.690" style="s2">move forward intelligently I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.420" end="01:49:12.110" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.690" end="01:49:15.350" style="s2">weird time but dude thank you for coming</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.110" end="01:49:16.730" style="s2">on the show thank you for and maybe you</p>
