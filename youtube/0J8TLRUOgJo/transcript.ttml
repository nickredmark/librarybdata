<p begin="00:00:00.260" end="00:00:05.700" style="s2">welcome this is an addendum to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">series awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:09.719" style="s2">recently I released an episode on young</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">as a prophet of the meaning crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.719" end="00:00:14.150" style="s2">decided it would it be a good idea to</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">have my good friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.150" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">Anderson Todd he&#39;s a former student of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">mine and that was a colleague of mine we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">worked together he&#39;s the associate</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">director of the consciousness of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">studies lab he has a degree in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:30.949" style="s2">science he&#39;s also studied young</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">extensively he&#39;s a practicing</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.949" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">psychotherapist so I thought it would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">a very good idea to bring Anderson in</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">and bring this into a more of a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">format and talk about young the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:46.440" style="s2">crisis and how that intersects with</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">other thinkers like Corbin and current</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.440" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">thinkers like Jordan Peterson so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">Anderson welcome very much welcome well</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">thanks Ryan I&#39;m happy to be here so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:59.030" style="s2">came to young quite early I think as</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">many people do I came to young sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.030" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">obliquely through sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">products you know he&#39;s hidden on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">cover of Sergeant peppers in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">background so you know I kept</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">encountering him the music of the police</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t have a very clear sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">it and then I began to read young when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:19.110" style="s2">was 12 or 13 and like things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">reading around the time I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.110" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">Freud as well and there is a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">big difference you know Freud is very</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">loose in writer right and so although I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">you know just grieve with a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">of what Freud rode and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">theory doesn&#39;t always hold up for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">although he&#39;s a giant the theory doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">always hold up for me nevertheless it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">has that lucid and quality right so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">reading at page by page it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">compelling and reading Jung was not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">that it was very difficult so I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">sort of wade through it and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">like slogging through mud and I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">hit these long passages like written in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">Greek and but nevertheless every page or</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">two I would hit sort of a jewel and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">stumble on something like this that just</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">sort of stopped me in my tracks you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">a single sentence or a single paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">that seemed to connect really really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">deeply to my felt experience of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">and so Jung came to have sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">an increasingly central role in the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">that I was structuring thinking around</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">psychology in my in my kind of teenage</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.270" style="s2">and then I dropped it and and came back</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">to it as one does with these things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.270" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">sort of went back and forth periodically</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">making like a deeper and deeper slog</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">into the collected works and I worked as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">a full-time writer for quite a few years</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:37.350" style="s2">as a as a novelist and nonfiction mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of hard to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.350" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">archetypal especially if you read people</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">like Northup Frye right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:43.740" style="s2">interested in critical theory although</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">northrup are actually never credits</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.740" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">young he did have highly imitated copies</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">of yumminess I didn&#39;t know that he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">never credits him never no in fact he</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:53.490" style="s2">deliberately kind of rejects and slags</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">on him I mean Young was sort of persona</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.490" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">non grata in the Academy and to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">extent still is right so you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">encountering these ideas more deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">and giving thought to them and when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">eventually came to university I had it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:12.990" style="s2">in mind to eventually work towards being</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">a psychotherapist which is what I now do</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.990" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">and had something of a depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">psychological framework in mind so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">kind of psychodynamic approach to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">thinking about people&#39;s to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">about people&#39;s problems in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">personality forms and development and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.050" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">on and so forth was very central for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:32.250" style="s2">but even then I felt that there were</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">pretty deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.250" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">problems with it so some of those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">reasonably well known you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:44.730" style="s2">died in the 60s and so you know lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">his ideas which may at one time have had</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">some currency you know really are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">pretty bad need of updating and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">in other areas like every other thinker</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">he&#39;s at least 50% wrong and that became</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:59.460" style="s2">sort of increasingly obvious to me where</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">he gets things right he&#39;s it&#39;s striking</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.460" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">and shocking and he&#39;s a very talented</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">phenomenologist and I think he was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:07.800" style="s2">remarkably talented clinician in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">ways but also you know there are big</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.800" end="00:04:12.290" style="s2">gaps in his theory there are pieces</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">where he struggles to articulate things</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.290" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t really have a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">language at hand to do so he does sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">of the best he can with you know quantum</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:23.299" style="s2">mechanics in places and it doesn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:23.299" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">but then also you know the the blind</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.449" style="s2">spots that just come about with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.810" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">that you know he&#39;s contrary to what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.449" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">Jungian community often I think treats</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:36.169" style="s2">it he&#39;s not a saint you know he&#39;s a man</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.940" style="s2">and he&#39;s a human being and one with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.169" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">know his own fairly deep character flaws</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.940" end="00:04:44.169" style="s2">so the desire to sort of supplement his</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:47.569" style="s2">work started to take on more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.169" end="00:04:50.659" style="s2">importance to me and then when I got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.569" end="00:04:53.030" style="s2">university yeah when I got to university</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.659" end="00:04:55.729" style="s2">as it turns out I already knew you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.030" end="00:04:57.500" style="s2">weirdly so I had I had audited your</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.729" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">classes like back in the 90s because</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.500" end="00:05:00.229" style="s2">friends of mine who are enrolled at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:02.780" style="s2">school were doing cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.229" end="00:05:04.220" style="s2">degree and because I didn&#39;t realize yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.780" end="00:05:05.389" style="s2">that I wanted to be part of the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.220" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">I just spent all of my time with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.389" end="00:05:09.830" style="s2">students and in the library I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:11.000" style="s2">auditing a bunch of your classes and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.830" end="00:05:13.690" style="s2">don&#39;t think you remember this we had an</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">argument of a leprechaun&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.690" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">where I was being I think a bit of a I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:19.250" style="s2">think I was being a bit of a like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.539" style="s2">intellectual saboteur you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.250" end="00:05:21.500" style="s2">explaining something I said you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.539" end="00:05:23.659" style="s2">something we could explain that with</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.500" end="00:05:24.680" style="s2">leprechauns and I remember you giving me</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.659" end="00:05:26.419" style="s2">like a really I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.680" end="00:05:30.139" style="s2">are you serious look I actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.419" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">like that that&#39;s a really good note for</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.139" end="00:05:34.969" style="s2">things anyway so so yeah so we had met</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.340" style="s2">then and had a few encounters and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.969" end="00:05:39.259" style="s2">when I first took your course on I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.340" end="00:05:41.539" style="s2">cognitive science and Buddhism I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.259" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">is the first course I took with you that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.539" end="00:05:48.440" style="s2">pretty rapidly got me to swing my major</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:49.669" style="s2">I had been doing an English major out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.440" end="00:05:52.580" style="s2">a simple desire to do something</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.669" end="00:05:54.770" style="s2">straightforward and I pretty rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.580" end="00:05:56.599" style="s2">dropped that and did cog sigh and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.770" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">not long thereafter I think that you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.599" end="00:06:00.830" style="s2">I started to collaborate so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">collaborating on the work around</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.830" end="00:06:05.569" style="s2">consciousness and then I think soon</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:07.729" style="s2">thereafter was when we started talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.569" end="00:06:09.800" style="s2">about the lab and a few other projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.729" end="00:06:12.229" style="s2">and of course you you were a speaker</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.800" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">right from the outset as were a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.229" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">other people Tony Tony Otto Dan told</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.050" end="00:06:18.919" style="s2">Herman Jordan Pederson we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:21.259" style="s2">speakers at the conference series that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.919" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">started yeah ah yeah mine manners which</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.259" end="00:06:29.210" style="s2">ran for six six years mm-hmm yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.770" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">yeah so in that time you know we you you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.210" end="00:06:34.490" style="s2">and I had sort of an increasing number</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:36.500" style="s2">of collaborations but also I had spent</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.490" end="00:06:37.009" style="s2">the better part of that period trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.500" end="00:06:39.889" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.009" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">wrestle these different interests I had</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.889" end="00:06:45.619" style="s2">in the mind into some kind of working</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:47.659" style="s2">synthesis and I sensed that it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.619" end="00:06:50.149" style="s2">possible to do so and that&#39;s still sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.659" end="00:06:55.129" style="s2">of an ongoing project and it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.149" end="00:06:58.249" style="s2">one because you know the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.129" end="00:06:58.939" style="s2">driving ethos of cognitive science you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.249" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">know you would make the argument</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.939" end="00:07:04.069" style="s2">generally and certainly here at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.710" style="s2">University of Toronto is this commitment</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.069" end="00:07:08.599" style="s2">to the naturalistic imperative yes but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.710" end="00:07:11.389" style="s2">was once asked by somebody really early</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.599" end="00:07:13.069" style="s2">on why why young at Toni Toni Otto</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.389" end="00:07:14.629" style="s2">actually yeah I said and I was in his</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.069" end="00:07:17.779" style="s2">office and I said why Freud</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.629" end="00:07:20.599" style="s2">Tony why Freud why Freud</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.779" end="00:07:22.819" style="s2">it was quite puzzled and he turned it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.599" end="00:07:25.699" style="s2">around variably on me and said well why</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.819" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">young and I was not prepared for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.699" end="00:07:30.729" style="s2">question and so I sort of struggled</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:33.830" style="s2">through it and what I came up with was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.729" end="00:07:35.449" style="s2">more than any of the other of the depth</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.830" end="00:07:37.309" style="s2">psychologists and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.449" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">theorists of the period and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.309" end="00:07:43.819" style="s2">psychodynamic sort of people young takes</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.580" end="00:07:46.909" style="s2">seriously the realities of the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.819" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">by that I don&#39;t mean it nor did young</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.909" end="00:07:51.349" style="s2">you know kind of like a disc Arnott you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:52.699" style="s2">know it&#39;s not a ghost living in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.349" end="00:07:55.819" style="s2">body that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.699" end="00:07:57.499" style="s2">but rather that young takes seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.819" end="00:08:01.219" style="s2">and directly you know take sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.499" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">reverentially the notion that spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.219" end="00:08:07.639" style="s2">reality and a sort of dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">meaning right that is abstract and not</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.639" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">easily grounded in physical things is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:16.219" style="s2">not just relevant but central to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.389" end="00:08:18.499" style="s2">human purpose and flourishing and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.219" end="00:08:21.529" style="s2">because Jung took that so seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.499" end="00:08:24.110" style="s2">also because I had you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.529" end="00:08:25.219" style="s2">the naturalistic imperative at work you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.110" end="00:08:27.289" style="s2">know I had a lot of work ahead of me in</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.219" end="00:08:29.269" style="s2">terms of trying to square those things</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.289" end="00:08:32.180" style="s2">all together right yeah and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.269" end="00:08:34.459" style="s2">like what you know what what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.180" end="00:08:36.529" style="s2">to have both of those commitments</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.459" end="00:08:39.769" style="s2">and like I said that&#39;s far from I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.529" end="00:08:41.329" style="s2">a fully solved problem but it&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.769" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">know the time went on it&#39;s been almost a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.329" end="00:08:47.089" style="s2">decade and I had theory from from before</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.380" style="s2">it&#39;s become increasingly clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.089" end="00:08:49.910" style="s2">that actually these things play together</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.380" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">far better</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:55.640" style="s2">then I think people might believe at</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:57.110" style="s2">first glance mmm yeah that would you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.640" end="00:08:59.750" style="s2">well there&#39;s two things that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.110" end="00:09:00.950" style="s2">give you a chance you were giving a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.750" end="00:09:03.649" style="s2">balanced overview of young but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:05.060" style="s2">recently told me that Young&#39;s reputation</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.649" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">has gone through a bit of redemption</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.060" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">maybe you could share that with people</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:10.760" style="s2">yeah sometimes I feel like I was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:13.310" style="s2">last person to know this so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.760" end="00:09:15.610" style="s2">teach young here at the University I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.310" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">have the great pleasure to teach the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.610" end="00:09:21.110" style="s2">interdisciplinary courses in Union</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:23.660" style="s2">Theory suite at new college and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.110" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">it as a young enthusiast right I&#39;m often</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.660" end="00:09:27.560" style="s2">called upon to defend young and the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">main thing that of course comes up</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.560" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">routinely is wasn&#39;t he a Nazi which you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">know that&#39;s a pretty serious charge and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:36.170" style="s2">you know there is a kind of an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:38.120" style="s2">split right in German intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.170" end="00:09:40.010" style="s2">right that this is the Tillich Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.120" end="00:09:43.209" style="s2">split Heidegger signs up to the party</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.010" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">Tillich says no and leaves and young</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.209" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">traditionally has fallen I think in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:48.500" style="s2">public perception to this funny middle</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.910" end="00:09:49.940" style="s2">ground and I know some people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.500" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">really really believed he was like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:55.160" style="s2">deep anti-semite and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">now that had never really washed with me</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.160" end="00:09:58.370" style="s2">it just didn&#39;t make sense it was clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:00.920" style="s2">that a lot of the Freudians had accused</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.370" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">him of anti-semitism but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.920" end="00:10:04.459" style="s2">like him for a lot of reasons right</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:07.250" style="s2">right and there was some fairly vicious</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.459" end="00:10:09.500" style="s2">exchanges in the psychodynamic community</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.250" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">after the young Fred breakup but then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.500" end="00:10:14.329" style="s2">found out like a little under a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:16.760" style="s2">so young part of the problem was that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.329" end="00:10:19.310" style="s2">Young had stayed on in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.760" end="00:10:21.829" style="s2">official capacity somewhat answering so</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:25.699" style="s2">when the Nazis took over young decided</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.829" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">to remain in charge of the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.699" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">of the psychoanalysis Society and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">obviously Freud being Jewish that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2">that was a no-go but young stayed on and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.810" style="s2">the idea was that like maybe he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:36.890" style="s2">of profited from that etc etc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.810" end="00:10:38.269" style="s2">there&#39;s some questions that he might</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.890" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">have been you know a sympathizer at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.269" end="00:10:43.699" style="s2">very least like not sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">resistant right but in fact I found out</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.699" end="00:10:51.470" style="s2">recently that it&#39;s on record that young</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:53.180" style="s2">in fact worked for the OSS ah so so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.470" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">OSS was though the world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.180" end="00:10:57.890" style="s2">precursor to the CIA yeah so it was sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">of the intelligence you know the spy arm</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.890" end="00:11:01.910" style="s2">basically of the Allied forces and Young</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">had an official an official designation</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.910" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">four eight eight he reported through</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.910" end="00:11:09.450" style="s2">Allen Dulles as Secretary to Allen</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">Dulles who became the first director of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.450" end="00:11:13.770" style="s2">the CIA and was a quite significant</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:15.630" style="s2">world war two agent and as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.770" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">this stuff is all still classified which</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.630" end="00:11:22.170" style="s2">itself is pretty weird but he did</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.800" end="00:11:24.660" style="s2">psychological profiles of high-ranking</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.170" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">Nazi Party members like he interacted</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.660" end="00:11:28.530" style="s2">with people and then I guess archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:30.270" style="s2">II profiled they&#39;re like mythic</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.530" end="00:11:32.760" style="s2">landscape or whatever and Allen Dulles</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.270" end="00:11:34.470" style="s2">is on record as having said that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.760" end="00:11:36.210" style="s2">know people will never really know how</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.470" end="00:11:39.080" style="s2">much of a contribution Professor Jung</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.210" end="00:11:42.840" style="s2">made to the winning of the war which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.080" end="00:11:45.900" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s neat so yeah he wasn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.840" end="00:11:47.910" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a Nazi business spy that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.900" end="00:11:50.760" style="s2">or something he was a secret agent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.910" end="00:11:51.840" style="s2">yeah yesterday its native so it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.760" end="00:11:57.870" style="s2">to finally have an answer in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.840" end="00:12:01.140" style="s2">respect but yeah so the reason I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.870" end="00:12:03.000" style="s2">to talk to you in more depth as well as</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.140" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">you know I you know my work we do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.000" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">of work together and I&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:10.010" style="s2">series awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:12.150" style="s2">and I see young as a pivotal figure I</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.150" end="00:12:14.670" style="s2">call the prophets of the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.590" end="00:12:16.950" style="s2">I&#39;m using prophet in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.670" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">sense not a fortune-teller but somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.950" end="00:12:22.440" style="s2">who&#39;s speaking truths that have a like</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:23.850" style="s2">have a that are like revelation they</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">need to they&#39;re not being noticed</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.850" end="00:12:27.840" style="s2">something needs to be seen something</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.730" style="s2">needs to be understood mm-hmm and for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.840" end="00:12:31.530" style="s2">you know books like modern man in search</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.730" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">of a soul and you mentioned the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.530" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">a soul seemed to me to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:38.520" style="s2">documents portending and trying to craft</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.420" end="00:12:40.740" style="s2">a response to the meeting crisis and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.520" end="00:12:43.860" style="s2">I thought maybe we could talk a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.740" end="00:12:45.930" style="s2">about that and then in connection with</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.860" end="00:12:47.490" style="s2">that I&#39;m sure another person you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">encountered at U of T especially with</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.490" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">your interest in young with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:54.870" style="s2">peterson and you&#39;re teaching courses on</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.490" end="00:12:57.330" style="s2">young so I imagine that comes up and I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.870" end="00:12:59.670" style="s2">think one of the reasons that Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.330" end="00:13:01.320" style="s2">work has well there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.670" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">reasons more so one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.320" end="00:13:06.150" style="s2">Jordans work is so has so much resonance</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:08.610" style="s2">is so popular I guess that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.150" end="00:13:09.960" style="s2">word especially amongst one group of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.610" end="00:13:12.330" style="s2">people the people that I&#39;m in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.960" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">with people like Jonathan pazzo and Paul</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.330" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">van der clay is that Jordan seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">crafted an interpretation of young</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:24.370" style="s2">similar in some ways to Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:26.140" style="s2">but and then he seemed to have used that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.370" end="00:13:28.180" style="s2">as a way of putting his finger on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.140" end="00:13:29.620" style="s2">pulse of the meaning crisis so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.180" end="00:13:32.080" style="s2">maybe we could talk about sort of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.620" end="00:13:35.320" style="s2">two topics we could talk about your take</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:37.270" style="s2">on young in the meaning crisis perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.320" end="00:13:40.030" style="s2">your take on my take on young in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.270" end="00:13:41.890" style="s2">meeting crisis and then how does Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.030" end="00:13:43.630" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work fit into this and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.890" end="00:13:44.860" style="s2">do you think about that in general</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.630" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2">because I&#39;m sure you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.860" end="00:13:50.200" style="s2">thoughts about this because you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.660" end="00:13:50.620" style="s2">teaching these courses about young at</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.200" end="00:13:55.420" style="s2">UofT</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.620" end="00:13:57.370" style="s2">yeah so so yeah well you know looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.420" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">sort of prophets of the men in crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.370" end="00:14:01.090" style="s2">generally speaking I thought you that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">was interesting as I&#39;m sort of watching</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.090" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2">you build the diagram I was like oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">that&#39;s where this is going and it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.080" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">very it was it was very interesting sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:14.020" style="s2">of account like you drew some lines that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:15.460" style="s2">were somewhat unexpected and I might</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.020" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">have in fact on some extra lines in</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.460" end="00:14:19.420" style="s2">there maybe I will</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.050" end="00:14:21.550" style="s2">in terms of Jung&#39;s role in that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.420" end="00:14:23.020" style="s2">I think you do identify some really</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.550" end="00:14:25.690" style="s2">important threads right there the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.020" end="00:14:29.080" style="s2">influences that sort of go into young</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.690" end="00:14:30.520" style="s2">that naturally form a part of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.080" end="00:14:33.220" style="s2">of meaning crisis account right so Conte</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.520" end="00:14:35.200" style="s2">is the ultra obvious choice right you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.220" end="00:14:37.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t mention Hegel but like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.200" end="00:14:40.600" style="s2">the approach to the Union synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.930" end="00:14:42.640" style="s2">the opposites is essentially pulls from</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.600" end="00:14:46.990" style="s2">the you know Hegelian dialectic and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:50.190" style="s2">practice of dialectic Plato is a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.990" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">obvious very blatantly obvious influence</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.190" end="00:14:59.170" style="s2">on young young allegedly did not like</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">Kierkegaard which yeah which might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.170" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">interesting to touch on but yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.420" style="s2">big thrust I think you&#39;re right quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.670" style="s2">right aside from his contemporaries is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.420" end="00:15:09.270" style="s2">is Conte and in fact so much so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.670" end="00:15:12.010" style="s2">Jung Jung referred to contest his</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.270" end="00:15:14.500" style="s2">philosopher he he was known in his</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.010" end="00:15:16.210" style="s2">medical residency to sort of bitch that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.500" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">he now only had time to read content</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.210" end="00:15:22.810" style="s2">Sunday so you know there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:25.570" style="s2">that you know concepts you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.810" end="00:15:27.070" style="s2">notion that we have sort of categories</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.570" end="00:15:29.620" style="s2">right the structure our experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.070" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">innately is very closely related to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.620" end="00:15:33.230" style="s2">Union</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:34.850" style="s2">of yeah get you can get that sort of by</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.230" end="00:15:37.250" style="s2">taking the Young&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.850" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">categories and Plato&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:42.519" style="s2">forms and sort of that&#39;s right mashing</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:45.019" style="s2">them together mashing them yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.519" end="00:15:46.100" style="s2">Young&#39;s concept of the archetype and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.019" end="00:15:48.019" style="s2">this is one of the problems when it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:49.850" style="s2">comes to studying young you know I often</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.019" end="00:15:51.740" style="s2">field questions there like when when</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.850" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">young uses this term what does he mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.740" end="00:15:55.699" style="s2">that&#39;s problematic it&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:57.410" style="s2">problematic because his work is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.699" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">occurring over a 50-year span and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.410" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">he means changes hmm now for one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">think young as a thinker was less</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">concerned with consistency than</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:10.519" style="s2">completeness to you know the good alien</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:13.009" style="s2">idea so because of that you know there</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.519" end="00:16:14.180" style="s2">is a grab-bag quality to his work you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.009" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">know you&#39;ll be going along and you be</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:19.009" style="s2">like yeah yeah sure okay grail meth good</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.220" end="00:16:21.380" style="s2">you know parental issues whatever UFO is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.009" end="00:16:23.690" style="s2">fine right that kind of thing happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.380" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">fairly routinely where his desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.690" end="00:16:27.500" style="s2">inclusive in the way that his</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:29.649" style="s2">phenomenology functions means that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">sometimes the pieces are a little loose</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.649" end="00:16:35.420" style="s2">but above and beyond that his specific</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:37.339" style="s2">ideas about what terms mean shifts</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.420" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">pretty considerably over the period so</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.339" end="00:16:40.819" style="s2">just to take archetype as an example</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:44.899" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about that sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.819" end="00:16:47.209" style="s2">okay so what I mean I was improving I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.899" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">was impressed by Storz idea that Young</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.209" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">has an organic model as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:54.290" style="s2">Freud&#39;s hydraulic model right and so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">thought it was appropriate I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.290" end="00:16:59.329" style="s2">hear your feedback on this too to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:01.000" style="s2">young III get that it&#39;s anachronistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.329" end="00:17:03.620" style="s2">but nevertheless maybe it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.000" end="00:17:05.390" style="s2">properly appropriating his work to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.620" end="00:17:07.699" style="s2">young in terms of like dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.390" end="00:17:09.500" style="s2">idea a self-organizing system and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.699" end="00:17:11.299" style="s2">you have a tractor states within that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.500" end="00:17:13.339" style="s2">self-organizing system things like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.299" end="00:17:17.030" style="s2">right and I was sort of pitching the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.339" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">architects along that line so the model</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.030" end="00:17:20.809" style="s2">I had in mind is like archetypes are</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.980" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">like settings of a parameter on a state</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.809" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">space as a dynamical and the dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.970" end="00:17:26.809" style="s2">system moves through the state space and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:28.459" style="s2">it has attractors and those attractors</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.809" end="00:17:29.929" style="s2">are sort of the image or the content of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.459" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">the archetype but they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.929" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">archetype itself the archit right is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:37.010" style="s2">that is that what would you think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.540" style="s2">that well okay so the the very nature of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.010" end="00:17:40.820" style="s2">the archetype right off the bat and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.540" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">know call dr. Conte is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.820" end="00:17:45.460" style="s2">the thing in itself you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:47.049" style="s2">get at yes oh the you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.460" end="00:17:49.330" style="s2">describe the archetypes and any final</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.049" end="00:17:51.279" style="s2">sense is sort of doomed to failure</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.330" end="00:17:53.019" style="s2">and young offers a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.279" end="00:17:55.240" style="s2">explanations for that some of it is just</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.019" end="00:17:57.159" style="s2">like it&#39;s inaccessible because it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.240" end="00:18:00.039" style="s2">before the subjective and objective</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.159" end="00:18:02.500" style="s2">world right so you know the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.039" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">exists sort of outside of the objective</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.500" end="00:18:06.340" style="s2">and subjective it it&#39;s part of the unis</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.470" style="s2">mundus and therefore you can&#39;t get at it</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.340" end="00:18:10.059" style="s2">that&#39;s one possibility but another</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.470" end="00:18:12.220" style="s2">possibility that he gives sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.059" end="00:18:14.139" style="s2">like well it&#39;s just too big it&#39;s too big</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.220" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">for your ego to grapple it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.139" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">can&#39;t pull it in because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:17.830" style="s2">too much of it and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:19.779" style="s2">shapeshifter</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.830" end="00:18:21.580" style="s2">like I said he moves around in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.779" end="00:18:23.769" style="s2">stuff I think they attract in Traktor</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.580" end="00:18:25.629" style="s2">state space and the idea of using</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.769" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">dynamical systems to talk of it as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.629" end="00:18:32.259" style="s2">interesting lens like it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:36.250" style="s2">interesting and one that I share it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.259" end="00:18:39.879" style="s2">maybe sanitizes a particular aspect</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.250" end="00:18:41.529" style="s2">though of Jung&#39;s focus on the psyche as</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.879" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">a living system</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.529" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">mm-hmm so obviously right like if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:48.820" style="s2">treat organic living systems as</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:50.590" style="s2">dynamical systems systems right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.820" end="00:18:52.419" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.590" end="00:18:54.009" style="s2">about talking about it in terms of state</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.419" end="00:18:56.590" style="s2">space and attractors that maybe doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.009" end="00:18:58.659" style="s2">quite capture so the analogy that I use</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.590" end="00:19:00.759" style="s2">sometimes okay is like in Freud&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.659" end="00:19:02.500" style="s2">hydraulic system you just have forces</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.759" end="00:19:04.330" style="s2">right pushing each other around so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.500" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">something is in your unconscious if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.330" end="00:19:08.409" style="s2">have a repressed content for instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:11.710" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like when you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.409" end="00:19:14.620" style="s2">keys in the couch you go to check your</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.710" end="00:19:17.169" style="s2">pocket and they aren&#39;t there and right</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.620" end="00:19:18.909" style="s2">and where are your keys and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.169" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">if you pull all the couch cushions out</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.909" end="00:19:22.090" style="s2">eventually you will find the keys right</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.470" end="00:19:22.450" style="s2">there they are they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.090" end="00:19:24.909" style="s2">anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.450" end="00:19:26.409" style="s2">or you might like your phone maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.909" end="00:19:27.850" style="s2">appear at your phone might go off and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.409" end="00:19:30.129" style="s2">you&#39;ll be like oh it&#39;s in the couch and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.850" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">nevertheless it&#39;s static it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.129" end="00:19:35.019" style="s2">there and in your complexes and things</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:38.379" style="s2">don&#39;t have that form because they have</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.019" end="00:19:39.909" style="s2">that living reality it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.379" end="00:19:42.399" style="s2">trying to catch a mouse behind your</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.909" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">couch so if you hear a mouse behind your</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.399" end="00:19:47.799" style="s2">couch and you pull the couch out the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:49.090" style="s2">mouse is gone right this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.799" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">sort of justifications for why you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.090" end="00:19:52.510" style="s2">should do analysis in tandem with</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.700" style="s2">somebody because they can wait at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.510" end="00:19:56.110" style="s2">other end of the couch to catch it when</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.700" end="00:19:59.770" style="s2">you pull the couch out so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.110" end="00:20:02.470" style="s2">right so that idea right that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.770" end="00:20:04.150" style="s2">dynamical system you know if you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.470" end="00:20:06.070" style="s2">sort of extend that notion to really</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.150" end="00:20:07.690" style="s2">include the idea of the living system</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.070" end="00:20:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah adjusting it has its own</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.690" end="00:20:10.600" style="s2">goals you certainly can</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.040" end="00:20:12.790" style="s2">yeah but I think state space sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.600" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">throws people off from that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.790" end="00:20:19.420" style="s2">dimension of it so like if the system is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.220" end="00:20:22.120" style="s2">is self-organizing and it has the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.420" end="00:20:24.040" style="s2">ability to sort of adapt to changing</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.120" end="00:20:25.270" style="s2">circumstances kind of like what I talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.040" end="00:20:27.370" style="s2">about when I talk about parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.270" end="00:20:29.620" style="s2">processing things like that so I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.370" end="00:20:33.070" style="s2">even go a little further I would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.620" end="00:20:34.900" style="s2">that it sort of maybe even explicit in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.070" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">yo but implicit in this particular take</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.900" end="00:20:39.160" style="s2">on young it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.929" style="s2">adaptive and it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.160" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">flexible and it&#39;s not even just that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.929" end="00:20:47.530" style="s2">it&#39;s self constituting it is intentional</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:50.290" style="s2">it has its own ideas about things mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.530" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">and its own goals and so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.290" end="00:20:53.860" style="s2">central in some sense to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:55.929" style="s2">psychodynamic model right the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:20:57.460" style="s2">psychodynamic model at its heart right</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.929" end="00:20:59.710" style="s2">which precedes Freud and Jung</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.460" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">considerably right like really the PERTs</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.710" end="00:21:03.130" style="s2">based model goes back to the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:05.020" style="s2">Greeks at some level earth but when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.130" end="00:21:08.410" style="s2">consider it in terms of the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.020" end="00:21:10.210" style="s2">you know in the modern sense the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.410" end="00:21:13.179" style="s2">psychodynamic model is a rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.210" end="00:21:16.330" style="s2">the unitive bias we all have this unit</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.179" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">of bias that we are singular unitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.330" end="00:21:21.580" style="s2">beings and that you know but in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:23.860" style="s2">know from a raft of scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.580" end="00:21:25.870" style="s2">and from you know loads of anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.860" end="00:21:27.610" style="s2">experience that people can share that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.870" end="00:21:31.090" style="s2">fact what we are is a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.610" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">forces or beings in a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.090" end="00:21:35.110" style="s2">relationship to each other that all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">happened to mostly answer to the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.110" end="00:21:39.490" style="s2">name and live at the same address so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:43.059" style="s2">that really then I mean there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.490" end="00:21:44.140" style="s2">then that Freud&#39;s notion or notion of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.059" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">the soul then is going to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.140" end="00:21:49.419" style="s2">deeply heretical right because then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:52.059" style="s2">not going to be the metaphysical locus</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.419" end="00:21:53.950" style="s2">of one&#39;s personal identity of it the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.059" end="00:21:57.160" style="s2">you&#39;re describing it you&#39;ve got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.950" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">micro agencies at work so what that what</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.160" end="00:22:01.650" style="s2">does the soul then become in that model</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.780" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">is certain I mean they&#39;re if there</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.650" end="00:22:06.809" style="s2">so one way one deep and ancient way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:08.580" style="s2">understanding the soul certainly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.809" end="00:22:11.190" style="s2">long-standing tradition tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.580" end="00:22:13.710" style="s2">when I say John when I&#39;m deeply and most</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.190" end="00:22:15.059" style="s2">directly and ultimately pointing to is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.710" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">my soul that man</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.059" end="00:22:18.510" style="s2">yeah well or my soul in the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:20.850" style="s2">sense I think yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.510" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">it&#39;s all about me that I identify with</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.850" end="00:22:24.870" style="s2">that is going to that is seeking</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:28.350" style="s2">salvation and some kind of integrated</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.870" end="00:22:32.220" style="s2">sure individual non divisible individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.350" end="00:22:33.809" style="s2">non dividable right whereas that that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.220" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is the case then Jung</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.809" end="00:22:37.380" style="s2">does not have that model at all no I</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think he does</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.380" end="00:22:42.540" style="s2">and and I think that a lot of this that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:43.740" style="s2">you know the term individuation really</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.540" end="00:22:46.710" style="s2">screws with people ah</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.740" end="00:22:48.390" style="s2">so share that please so individuation is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.710" end="00:22:50.700" style="s2">like you know some people tend to tag</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.390" end="00:22:52.470" style="s2">this as sort of the Union enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.470" end="00:22:59.070" style="s2">accurate but individuation is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">the it&#39;s hard to say when when Jung uses</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.070" end="00:23:03.030" style="s2">it whether he means it to be descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:05.040" style="s2">or prescriptive is it a goal that one</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.030" end="00:23:07.050" style="s2">has or it&#39;s simply a description of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.040" end="00:23:09.900" style="s2">the mind does but it&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.050" end="00:23:10.890" style="s2">movement towards being who you are okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.900" end="00:23:12.630" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the idea that you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.890" end="00:23:15.570" style="s2">becoming more fully who you are over</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.630" end="00:23:18.420" style="s2">time a lot of people take the term</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.570" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">individuation to indicate that they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.420" end="00:23:24.300" style="s2">eventually going to become in divisible</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">yeah right that they&#39;ll become unitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.300" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">and Locke but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:30.300" style="s2">actually indicated at all and sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">looking at how that works and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.300" end="00:23:35.580" style="s2">about it sort of in those terms it gets</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:37.400" style="s2">closer to what you mean so okay so in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.580" end="00:23:40.590" style="s2">the Union system right you have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.400" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">you know multiple multiple sort of loci</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.590" end="00:23:45.450" style="s2">of agency right so you have your</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:47.550" style="s2">complexes right which are various forms</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.450" end="00:23:49.410" style="s2">and then there are a few things like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.550" end="00:23:55.230" style="s2">you know the whelmed of the ego the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.410" end="00:23:56.309" style="s2">shadow itself right the persona when</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.230" end="00:23:58.500" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.309" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">between ego and self particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.500" end="00:24:02.370" style="s2">ego is the center of your conscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:05.940" style="s2">experience and it&#39;s the center of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.370" end="00:24:07.860" style="s2">self-identification and one way to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.940" end="00:24:10.140" style="s2">at sort of the process of individuation</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.860" end="00:24:12.030" style="s2">is that you know everything else that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.140" end="00:24:14.340" style="s2">happens is just facilitating a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.030" end="00:24:15.810" style="s2">particular change in the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.340" end="00:24:18.420" style="s2">between the ego and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.810" end="00:24:20.850" style="s2">yeah the download yeah one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.420" end="00:24:22.470" style="s2">that I think so one of the ways that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.850" end="00:24:24.690" style="s2">think is useful to think about this or</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.470" end="00:24:26.730" style="s2">the metaphor that I teach often is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.690" end="00:24:29.790" style="s2">shift from the Giulia geocentric the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.730" end="00:24:32.280" style="s2">heliocentric thinking okay so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.790" end="00:24:34.560" style="s2">for a second that the ego is the earth</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.280" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">okay so of course the earth thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.560" end="00:24:38.370" style="s2">it&#39;s the center of the universe right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the geocentric model and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.370" end="00:24:43.560" style="s2">into the sky and we see we see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.970" style="s2">bodies in the heavens moving around</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.560" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">right the Sun rises and falls with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.970" end="00:24:48.390" style="s2">certain degree of regularity the moon</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">goes through its phases whatever and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.390" end="00:24:54.870" style="s2">see the planets moving in this frankly</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:57.270" style="s2">kind of erratic way and as we try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.870" end="00:25:00.330" style="s2">model that right we build worries and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.270" end="00:25:02.520" style="s2">systems of rotation and in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.330" end="00:25:05.160" style="s2">the mathematics of this model the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:07.920" style="s2">we have to add increasing like epicycles</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.160" end="00:25:10.680" style="s2">right and elaborate this and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.920" end="00:25:12.420" style="s2">big Copernican shift the big Copernican</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.680" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">shift and this was not a new idea to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.420" end="00:25:15.270" style="s2">Copernicus right goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">pythagorean&#39;s and the church knew about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.270" end="00:25:22.620" style="s2">it yeah Aristarchus right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">big move is that you know we treat the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.620" end="00:25:26.160" style="s2">Sun as the center and of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:30.450" style="s2">Copernicus himself is very guarded yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.160" end="00:25:32.310" style="s2">at that no way the Galileo isn&#39;t yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.450" end="00:25:34.260" style="s2">we treat the Sun as the center and why</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.310" end="00:25:35.810" style="s2">do we do that because it makes the math</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.260" end="00:25:39.020" style="s2">easier</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.810" end="00:25:42.540" style="s2">similarily right if you are standing on</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.020" end="00:25:44.340" style="s2">ego and you look up and you think ego is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.540" end="00:25:45.690" style="s2">the center of the system then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.340" end="00:25:47.790" style="s2">movements of the other bodies in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.690" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">system are highly erratic and difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.790" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2">to predict it makes no sense trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:56.250" style="s2">relate everything back to ego means that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.700" end="00:25:56.850" style="s2">things are confusing and weird right</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.250" end="00:25:59.400" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.850" end="00:26:02.790" style="s2">if instead you realize that the center</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.400" end="00:26:04.800" style="s2">of the system right is that thing up</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.790" end="00:26:07.170" style="s2">there right the self and the self and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.800" end="00:26:09.330" style="s2">the Sun you know Co appear in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.170" end="00:26:11.790" style="s2">literature all the time right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.330" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">of course God is the Sun what else would</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.790" end="00:26:16.050" style="s2">it be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:17.790" style="s2">so you know when when you suddenly treat</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.050" end="00:26:19.500" style="s2">the self as the center of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.790" end="00:26:22.050" style="s2">realize that everything including your</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.500" end="00:26:24.570" style="s2">ego is actually existing in a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.050" end="00:26:26.310" style="s2">relationship to that suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.570" end="00:26:28.460" style="s2">motions of your psyche becomes sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.310" end="00:26:30.019" style="s2">more explicable more predictive</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.460" end="00:26:31.669" style="s2">when you realize that not everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.019" end="00:26:35.059" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in your psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.669" end="00:26:36.740" style="s2">serving you the ego right so what does</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.059" end="00:26:39.889" style="s2">that what would that a couple questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.740" end="00:26:41.419" style="s2">first of all the first question is what</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.889" end="00:26:44.869" style="s2">does that look like phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.419" end="00:26:46.789" style="s2">is it you know it sounds similar to me I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.869" end="00:26:48.980" style="s2">think people have pointed this out two</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.789" end="00:26:51.460" style="s2">aspects of Vedanta well the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.980" end="00:26:53.720" style="s2">between the ego and the Ottoman right</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.460" end="00:26:55.509" style="s2">and but what does that look like and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.720" end="00:26:58.100" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s part of the confusion with</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.509" end="00:26:59.090" style="s2">enlightenment because Ryan Vedanta</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.100" end="00:27:02.179" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.090" end="00:27:04.490" style="s2">enlightenment and then secondly the more</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.179" end="00:27:05.929" style="s2">I see what you&#39;re saying and the more</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.490" end="00:27:07.460" style="s2">we&#39;re drawing out these connections the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.929" end="00:27:09.289" style="s2">more tortured the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.460" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">Jung and Christianity now seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.289" end="00:27:14.509" style="s2">very much yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:17.149" style="s2">I mean young young is not a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.509" end="00:27:19.190" style="s2">realms a Gnostic yeah well I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.149" end="00:27:22.220" style="s2">know it the Christian Gnostics right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.190" end="00:27:24.110" style="s2">and likewise you know you know there</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.220" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">were forms of Christianity that dipped</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.110" end="00:27:27.110" style="s2">into that right like the Nestorians</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.330" style="s2">right had that court of the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.110" end="00:27:31.399" style="s2">double built into it yeah we can get to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.330" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">that in a sec so what&#39;s the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.399" end="00:27:34.490" style="s2">well I mean the thing is that well first</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:36.230" style="s2">of all what does look like phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.490" end="00:27:37.580" style="s2">phenomenologically so and then there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.230" end="00:27:39.110" style="s2">then that will explore the morals so</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.580" end="00:27:40.999" style="s2">that tells you about the relationship I</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.110" end="00:27:42.649" style="s2">mean you know the thing that said is and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.999" end="00:27:45.649" style="s2">there are sort of intermediary stages</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.649" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">right generally speaking within sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.649" end="00:27:49.879" style="s2">Union individuation you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:52.249" style="s2">not aiming to have a direct encounter</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.879" end="00:27:53.690" style="s2">with the self right away right there so</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.249" end="00:27:55.460" style="s2">typically speaking you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.690" end="00:27:57.080" style="s2">doing shadow work first that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.460" end="00:27:59.090" style="s2">the apprentice piece typically in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.080" end="00:28:02.119" style="s2">literature then you&#39;re doing work with</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.090" end="00:28:04.340" style="s2">the anima animus your contra sexual soul</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.119" end="00:28:07.460" style="s2">image okay and then eventually that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.340" end="00:28:09.649" style="s2">segues through into the wider wooly</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.460" end="00:28:12.259" style="s2">menagerie of archetypal forces and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.649" end="00:28:13.909" style="s2">beyond that the self soul or self also</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.259" end="00:28:15.740" style="s2">reach as you&#39;re reaching towards the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.909" end="00:28:17.179" style="s2">self is it reaching towards you because</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.740" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">you describe these things as if they</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.179" end="00:28:21.940" style="s2">have at least kind of a a para</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">intentionality or something like yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.940" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">so the the self often gets described as</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:30.950" style="s2">the center and totality of the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:32.869" style="s2">and that throws people the center and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.950" end="00:28:34.519" style="s2">totality but I think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.869" end="00:28:36.619" style="s2">maintain the kind of solar system model</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.519" end="00:28:37.429" style="s2">that makes no more sense right well</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.619" end="00:28:39.139" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was trying to use the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.429" end="00:28:41.720" style="s2">attractor state right yeah yeah same</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.139" end="00:28:42.500" style="s2">kind of thing so so if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.720" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">Sun</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.500" end="00:28:45.680" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like yes it&#39;s the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s discrete but also it&#39;s cynical</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.680" end="00:28:49.310" style="s2">anon you take the Sun out there is no</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:52.940" style="s2">system everything flies off in a space</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.310" end="00:28:54.800" style="s2">right so and it is sort of you know out</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.940" end="00:28:55.790" style="s2">of an accretion disk or however much you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:28:58.100" style="s2">want to push on this cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.790" end="00:28:59.780" style="s2">metaphor you know everything is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.100" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">around that what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.780" end="00:29:04.490" style="s2">phenomenology and phenomenologically so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">this is a thing and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.490" end="00:29:10.220" style="s2">think Jung ends up with a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">interesting interesting and distinct</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.220" end="00:29:15.860" style="s2">approach to much of the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:18.980" style="s2">material is that the encounter with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.860" end="00:29:20.600" style="s2">self this central organizing meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.980" end="00:29:22.070" style="s2">producing right the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.600" end="00:29:24.410" style="s2">organizing all the other forces in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.070" end="00:29:25.910" style="s2">psyche as often as not shows up in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.410" end="00:29:28.310" style="s2">of mystical and religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.910" end="00:29:29.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the phenomenology of it mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.310" end="00:29:32.390" style="s2">sometimes I talk about depth psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.780" end="00:29:35.690" style="s2">and I sort of tongue-in-cheek like to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.390" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2">call it the theory and practice of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.690" end="00:29:43.160" style="s2">things you&#39;ll have to deal with anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:44.870" style="s2">right because many of the aspects of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:47.570" style="s2">me and depth psychology specifically are</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.870" end="00:29:50.540" style="s2">about having to take into account</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.570" end="00:29:52.760" style="s2">aspects of your own psyche right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.540" end="00:29:55.160" style="s2">you kind of can&#39;t get around and denying</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.760" end="00:29:58.790" style="s2">them does you no good so Jung has that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.160" end="00:30:01.430" style="s2">position about about you know the divine</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.790" end="00:30:02.840" style="s2">basically speaking - right he says at</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.430" end="00:30:06.200" style="s2">the end of the day epistemologically</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.840" end="00:30:08.120" style="s2">like what possible evidence could we get</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.200" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">in one direction or another that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.120" end="00:30:11.750" style="s2">prove or disprove the existence of God</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.220" end="00:30:13.970" style="s2">so this lines up with Hicks argument</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.750" end="00:30:15.920" style="s2">about the spiritual ambiguity of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.970" end="00:30:17.630" style="s2">empirical evidence that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.920" end="00:30:20.270" style="s2">very much so I think you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.630" end="00:30:21.140" style="s2">sense Jung is sort of an early important</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.270" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.140" end="00:30:25.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to argue that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:28.070" style="s2">he&#39;s best understood as a non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:30.260" style="s2">yeah I think so too although his work</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.070" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">gets cagey er towards the end I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.260" end="00:30:33.620" style="s2">you know he moves like I said the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">archetypes start being sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.620" end="00:30:37.850" style="s2">psychic equivalent of like a reflex</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:39.740" style="s2">right like getting your your knee tapped</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.850" end="00:30:41.180" style="s2">and yeah right so they start like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.740" end="00:30:43.070" style="s2">and I think that there&#39;s some good</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.180" end="00:30:46.040" style="s2">material to think about them in those</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.070" end="00:30:48.440" style="s2">terms which we can touch on but</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.040" end="00:30:51.320" style="s2">eventually they become sort of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.440" end="00:30:53.300" style="s2">principles like as he moves to explain</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.320" end="00:30:56.450" style="s2">them they become more and more like</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.300" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">content categories</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:30:59.720" style="s2">right but like even more so more maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:01.340" style="s2">like the platonic well I was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.720" end="00:31:04.790" style="s2">it sounds like towards the end what</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.340" end="00:31:06.200" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and guess I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.790" end="00:31:07.910" style="s2">read way more of young than I have but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.200" end="00:31:09.920" style="s2">know there are several passages where he</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.910" end="00:31:13.040" style="s2">explicitly excused metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.920" end="00:31:14.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a Content thing but from what</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.040" end="00:31:16.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve been telling me and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.360" end="00:31:18.770" style="s2">talked about this and past words the end</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.250" end="00:31:22.220" style="s2">he starts talking metaphysically yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.770" end="00:31:24.800" style="s2">again and so it sounds like he maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.220" end="00:31:26.630" style="s2">reversing the content isn&#39;t back towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.800" end="00:31:28.790" style="s2">a more platonic model is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.630" end="00:31:30.470" style="s2">thing to say so actually I think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.790" end="00:31:32.840" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is that in those late</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.470" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">stage passages he is attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.840" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">reconcile the trans jet</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.580" end="00:31:41.450" style="s2">all finished the other thing first them</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:43.340" style="s2">you know come back so so his take on God</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.450" end="00:31:44.300" style="s2">is basically right it&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.340" end="00:31:46.610" style="s2">that there is an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.300" end="00:31:48.170" style="s2">epistemological limit you cannot get in</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.610" end="00:31:48.650" style="s2">existence or non-existence of God</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.170" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">finally</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.650" end="00:31:56.270" style="s2">but it&#39;s indisputable that people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:59.900" style="s2">these forces and encounters in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.270" end="00:32:02.450" style="s2">mind and his basic point is it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.900" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter at some level whether or</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.450" end="00:32:07.040" style="s2">not there&#39;s actually a God because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.620" style="s2">do have to have an encounter with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.040" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">part of yourself that is the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.620" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">forming and the locus of the sacred it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:15.950" style="s2">sort of the inexhaustible wellspring of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.020" style="s2">your being you have to have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.950" end="00:32:20.270" style="s2">encounter with that if you don&#39;t you end</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.020" end="00:32:22.310" style="s2">up often kind of deeply stunted in terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.270" end="00:32:24.110" style="s2">of your own potentials and and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.310" end="00:32:27.110" style="s2">you&#39;re you know what your life is and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:28.610" style="s2">how you fit into it right and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.110" end="00:32:30.170" style="s2">is the he points out is he&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.610" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2">this thing has certain ways of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.170" end="00:32:33.170" style="s2">communicating and the ways that it wants</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:36.460" style="s2">to communicate or any symbolism in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.170" end="00:32:38.540" style="s2">ritual so even though it may not be an</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.460" end="00:32:40.460" style="s2">actual Divine Principle in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.540" end="00:32:43.430" style="s2">alternate metaphysical sense you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.460" end="00:32:45.020" style="s2">deal with it like it is so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.430" end="00:32:46.790" style="s2">an instance or where I talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.020" end="00:32:48.200" style="s2">being psychologically indispensable but</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.790" end="00:32:49.820" style="s2">not metaphysically necessary that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.200" end="00:32:52.510" style="s2">right that&#39;s right okay so that&#39;s fair I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.820" end="00:32:52.510" style="s2">can understand that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.670" end="00:32:56.150" style="s2">so one criticism and I&#39;ve heard it for</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.800" end="00:32:58.580" style="s2">many people I think Durley makes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.150" end="00:33:00.500" style="s2">criticism at one point I think uber is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.580" end="00:33:04.910" style="s2">making a criticism along these lines of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.500" end="00:33:06.890" style="s2">of young is this is all intrapsychic and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.910" end="00:33:09.620" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.890" end="00:33:11.780" style="s2">huge aspects existential mode aspects</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.620" end="00:33:15.410" style="s2">that are central to the understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.780" end="00:33:16.910" style="s2">God now that I&#39;m I&#39;m prompting you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.410" end="00:33:18.500" style="s2">return back to there I think he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.910" end="00:33:21.020" style="s2">to make about the trans dick tivity so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.500" end="00:33:22.520" style="s2">so I mean I understand that critique I</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.020" end="00:33:23.900" style="s2">just don&#39;t think it&#39;s the case and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.520" end="00:33:25.700" style="s2">know so please so the reason I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.900" end="00:33:28.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s the case is sort of a few</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.700" end="00:33:30.830" style="s2">folds like one is you know we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.490" end="00:33:32.530" style="s2">talking about the imaginal right and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.830" end="00:33:35.240" style="s2">you know the deep dialogue between</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.530" end="00:33:37.429" style="s2">Corbin and yes young at the the era</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.240" end="00:33:38.690" style="s2">knows lectures which job can I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.429" end="00:33:41.540" style="s2">interrupt would you say it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.690" end="00:33:43.970" style="s2">and I was trying to make a case that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.540" end="00:33:45.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s important to the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.970" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">of young that the connection to Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.590" end="00:33:49.670" style="s2">be made more explicit and more developed</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:52.309" style="s2">scholastically yeah I mean as much as I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.670" end="00:33:54.230" style="s2">gripe about people deriving ideas from</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.309" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">young and not crediting him Young</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.230" end="00:33:59.210" style="s2">himself was not always particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.890" style="s2">about crediting sources of ideas right</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.210" end="00:34:03.380" style="s2">you know he was a little bit self</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.890" end="00:34:05.510" style="s2">mythologizing I think and consciously or</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.380" end="00:34:07.880" style="s2">unconsciously hard to say but like you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.510" end="00:34:10.490" style="s2">know famously he essentially speaking he</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.880" end="00:34:12.409" style="s2">and Freud stole work from sabina</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.490" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">spielrein yeah right she was the one who</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.409" end="00:34:16.369" style="s2">had come up with the concept of like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:18.080" style="s2">fana TOEIC death drive and she had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.369" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">of important contributions to early work</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.080" end="00:34:24.919" style="s2">but no credit right so yeah I mean I see</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:26.950" style="s2">I see Corbin nodding towards young yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.919" end="00:34:29.659" style="s2">but I don&#39;t so much see young</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.950" end="00:34:31.639" style="s2">referencing so yeah I I agree I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.659" end="00:34:33.800" style="s2">that was an important relationship there</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.639" end="00:34:35.629" style="s2">are no lectures generally speaking you</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.800" end="00:34:36.980" style="s2">know as a set of sort of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.629" end="00:34:38.869" style="s2">encounters between people that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.980" end="00:34:41.060" style="s2">doing that work in the period are</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.869" end="00:34:43.369" style="s2">remarkable did that ever lend you my</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.060" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">copy of no you didn&#39;t but you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.369" end="00:34:47.540" style="s2">it&#39;s really good anyway yeah so bringing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:49.940" style="s2">it back you&#39;re gonna go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.540" end="00:34:53.659" style="s2">imaginal and and this this critique of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.940" end="00:34:56.690" style="s2">young as being merely intrapsychic right</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.659" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">so okay so when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.690" end="00:35:00.200" style="s2">imaginal and we talk about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:03.710" style="s2">like active imagination right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.200" end="00:35:06.980" style="s2">relatively I think easy</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.710" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">so for people to pull into the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.980" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about is just a play</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:13.010" style="s2">of imagination yeah but where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:14.180" style="s2">less clear is in the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.010" end="00:35:16.670" style="s2">dreams hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.180" end="00:35:18.230" style="s2">dreams as a form of the imaginal right</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.670" end="00:35:19.579" style="s2">because they&#39;re not sort of deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.230" end="00:35:21.650" style="s2">and occurring in an overlay on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.579" end="00:35:24.530" style="s2">conscious mind are spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.650" end="00:35:26.780" style="s2">produced right spontaneously produced</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.530" end="00:35:29.420" style="s2">imaginal material and so they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.780" end="00:35:31.819" style="s2">more directly speak to this interface</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.420" end="00:35:34.790" style="s2">point between the experiencing self</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.819" end="00:35:39.530" style="s2">right and the sort of the self which</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.790" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">makes and when you look at that material</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.530" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">in the way that they talk about dream</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:45.530" style="s2">interpretation in particular right like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:48.050" style="s2">marie-louise von Franz who was one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.530" end="00:35:50.150" style="s2">Jung sort of foremost you know disciples</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.050" end="00:35:52.940" style="s2">in to some extent popularizer right she</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.150" end="00:35:54.170" style="s2">wrote very lucidly and she often said</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.940" end="00:35:56.089" style="s2">about dreams that when you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.170" end="00:35:57.530" style="s2">with a dream simple you know somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.089" end="00:36:00.470" style="s2">appears in your dream your father</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.530" end="00:36:02.839" style="s2">appears in your dream it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.470" end="00:36:05.089" style="s2">pointing outwards and inwards always</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.839" end="00:36:06.980" style="s2">homeless and the thing in fact when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.089" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">do dream interpretation I noticed it</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.980" end="00:36:10.309" style="s2">when I was in analysis and I noticed it</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:11.930" style="s2">with my own clients is that more often</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.309" end="00:36:13.400" style="s2">than not people have tendency to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.930" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">dream material as pointing outwards</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.400" end="00:36:17.690" style="s2">right but not to pick up that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.579" style="s2">pointing inwards I see and Vaughn</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.690" end="00:36:21.859" style="s2">friends actually I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.579" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">of this emphasis was Jung&#39;s himself but</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.859" end="00:36:26.270" style="s2">von Franz actually sort of said like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:29.000" style="s2">really you should count that as 20%</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.270" end="00:36:30.980" style="s2">outwards an 80% inwards I&#39;m not so sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.000" end="00:36:33.500" style="s2">about that I actually think that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.980" end="00:36:35.720" style="s2">of young later work around the cycloid</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.500" end="00:36:37.579" style="s2">right which was this term that he had</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.720" end="00:36:40.490" style="s2">for something right that the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.579" end="00:36:42.859" style="s2">simultaneously reached into the material</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.490" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">and the psychic worlds and he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.859" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">basically I think you know he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.180" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">to solve the mind-body problem at some</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:50.180" style="s2">level right but he was doing it in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:52.220" style="s2">funny roundabout way because he was in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.180" end="00:36:54.260" style="s2">dialogue with Wolfgang Pauli and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.220" end="00:36:55.460" style="s2">thought maybe if they through quantum</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.260" end="00:36:56.750" style="s2">mechanics at it they could crack it</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:36:59.569" style="s2">right I think they just didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.750" end="00:37:01.160" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have the tools yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.569" end="00:37:03.109" style="s2">the transgender is is very much a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.160" end="00:37:05.240" style="s2">preoccupation for him and when you do</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.109" end="00:37:07.250" style="s2">specifically dream analysis dream</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.240" end="00:37:08.890" style="s2">interpretation that quality of pointing</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.250" end="00:37:11.180" style="s2">outwards and pointing inwards is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.890" end="00:37:13.010" style="s2">central holding both of those things in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.180" end="00:37:15.799" style="s2">mind simultaneously is central to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.010" end="00:37:16.849" style="s2">understanding what it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.799" end="00:37:20.670" style="s2">happening in a dream</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.849" end="00:37:22.190" style="s2">so could could could dream symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.670" end="00:37:24.180" style="s2">perhaps archetypes in general therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:25.950" style="s2">afford something like sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.180" end="00:37:27.630" style="s2">transcendence were you getting where</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.950" end="00:37:30.630" style="s2">you&#39;re getting an insight that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.630" end="00:37:32.369" style="s2">directed outward and inward at the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.630" end="00:37:34.589" style="s2">time like John Wright talks about yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.369" end="00:37:38.099" style="s2">well but but I think it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.589" end="00:37:39.869" style="s2">people to do of course so yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.099" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">absolutely you know most people when</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.869" end="00:37:43.529" style="s2">they have that dream symbol I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.940" end="00:37:45.029" style="s2">know lots of people have had and we sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.529" end="00:37:47.130" style="s2">of sort of smirk right it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.029" end="00:37:48.420" style="s2">somebody you know you know your partner</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.130" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">or something has a dream and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.420" end="00:37:51.990" style="s2">like halt just had a dream and you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">did something terrible and they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.990" end="00:37:59.910" style="s2">of mad at you and you&#39;re like about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:38:01.380" style="s2">okay but so you know that outward facing</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.910" end="00:38:03.510" style="s2">aspect of dreams and then people will</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.380" end="00:38:05.160" style="s2">tend to sort of hand wave it but people</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.510" end="00:38:06.750" style="s2">don&#39;t naturally speaking tend to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.160" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">gravitate towards what dreams are saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.750" end="00:38:11.180" style="s2">about themselves right the dreams are</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:14.819" style="s2">less messages than they are sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.180" end="00:38:16.890" style="s2">immersion in the process of your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.819" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">a participatory knowing a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.890" end="00:38:21.089" style="s2">knowing right I mean you know it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:22.890" style="s2">to grasp I do this stuff pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.089" end="00:38:25.529" style="s2">full-time and have done for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.890" end="00:38:27.660" style="s2">but when I really sit with the idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.529" end="00:38:31.049" style="s2">like so I have a dream and in that dream</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.660" end="00:38:33.960" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to you know my friend you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.049" end="00:38:36.599" style="s2">know and but who am i interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.960" end="00:38:38.430" style="s2">I&#39;m not interacting with him so Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.599" end="00:38:41.430" style="s2">interacting with I&#39;m interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.430" end="00:38:43.349" style="s2">myself like some portion of my mind and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.430" end="00:38:45.960" style="s2">yet I&#39;m not consciously doing this but</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.349" end="00:38:47.910" style="s2">some part of me is and of course we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.960" end="00:38:49.559" style="s2">now used to in neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.910" end="00:38:52.109" style="s2">cognitive science the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.559" end="00:38:53.700" style="s2">sort of conjuring the hallucination of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.109" end="00:38:56.430" style="s2">the world around a set of scant data</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.700" end="00:38:58.740" style="s2">right but it&#39;s very clear in a dream</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.430" end="00:39:00.779" style="s2">especially like a lucid dream where</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.740" end="00:39:02.869" style="s2">those interactions can be quite rich and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.779" end="00:39:04.920" style="s2">they can be quite have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.869" end="00:39:06.750" style="s2">phenomenological detail and depth the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.920" end="00:39:10.049" style="s2">add one not last night but the night</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.750" end="00:39:12.359" style="s2">before really yeah it&#39;s been a while I</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.049" end="00:39:13.799" style="s2">had one like a month ago mmm I keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.359" end="00:39:16.829" style="s2">meaning to get back into it but that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.799" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">have to do that in January so so I want</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.829" end="00:39:20.339" style="s2">to slow down here a little bit I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:23.069" style="s2">twenty that&#39;s really interesting so just</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.339" end="00:39:24.690" style="s2">because like the Buber critique</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.069" end="00:39:26.910" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re not picking up</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.690" end="00:39:28.920" style="s2">on the existential modes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.910" end="00:39:31.079" style="s2">and Bluebird has something you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.920" end="00:39:32.509" style="s2">I thou are yet which is I argue is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.079" end="00:39:34.890" style="s2">analogous to froms</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.509" end="00:39:36.119" style="s2">having mode and behavior and these are</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.890" end="00:39:38.219" style="s2">existential modes and they&#39;re inherently</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.119" end="00:39:40.109" style="s2">transductive yeah they&#39;re they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.219" end="00:39:41.969" style="s2">both processes by which you&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.109" end="00:39:44.819" style="s2">identities participatory knowing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.969" end="00:39:46.349" style="s2">and I assigned identities and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.819" end="00:39:47.789" style="s2">conformity relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.349" end="00:39:50.969" style="s2">they&#39;re their code determining code</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.789" end="00:39:53.329" style="s2">defining yeah and so I get this sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.969" end="00:39:56.819" style="s2">and I and I see just to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.329" end="00:39:58.499" style="s2">really we&#39;re on false I see alchemy as</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.819" end="00:40:01.049" style="s2">one describes it as inherently</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.499" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">transductive because you&#39;re you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.049" end="00:40:04.920" style="s2">this transformation of the psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.140" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get it to conform with</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.920" end="00:40:09.269" style="s2">the material world and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.140" end="00:40:11.459" style="s2">get the two to get some sort of mutually</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.269" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">afforded disclosure happening is that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.459" end="00:40:16.680" style="s2">fair interpretation yeah partly but</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:18.779" style="s2">partly it&#39;s also about using projection</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.680" end="00:40:20.699" style="s2">right right as an innate capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.779" end="00:40:22.019" style="s2">externalize the contents of your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.699" end="00:40:23.910" style="s2">to a place where you can work on them</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.019" end="00:40:25.709" style="s2">without it being so personal right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.910" end="00:40:28.349" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s doing it&#39;s doing it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.709" end="00:40:30.989" style="s2">too thick right so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.349" end="00:40:32.699" style="s2">get at the Philosopher&#39;s Stone is both</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.989" end="00:40:35.519" style="s2">an overcoming of deep patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.699" end="00:40:37.769" style="s2">self-deception with the projection yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.519" end="00:40:40.739" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t it also given me some</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.769" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">access I don&#39;t mean scientifically but</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.739" end="00:40:46.559" style="s2">right some access to you know patterns</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:50.009" style="s2">in reality that will help me it make</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.559" end="00:40:51.449" style="s2">more better sense of the world yes so so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.009" end="00:40:54.269" style="s2">to bring this back around to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.449" end="00:40:56.069" style="s2">geocentric heliocentric right okay good</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.269" end="00:40:58.109" style="s2">when you have that sort of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.069" end="00:40:59.789" style="s2">divine encounter or such as it is with</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.109" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">the self right one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.789" end="00:41:02.910" style="s2">point out is that that experience the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:06.779" style="s2">encounter with the self is always deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.910" end="00:41:08.819" style="s2">humiliating mm-hmm he&#39;s quite kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.779" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">keen on this it is always humiliating no</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.819" end="00:41:11.729" style="s2">did he mean that because I&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.109" style="s2">distinction in the series there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.729" end="00:41:15.449" style="s2">ways there&#39;s our modern meaning where</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.109" end="00:41:17.009" style="s2">humiliation is a pejorative thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.449" end="00:41:19.079" style="s2">bad thing right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.009" end="00:41:21.029" style="s2">humiliation in the original sense which</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.079" end="00:41:22.589" style="s2">is the engendering the creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.029" end="00:41:24.869" style="s2">futility of humility I think it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.589" end="00:41:26.459" style="s2">it&#39;s both I think it&#39;s both so I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.869" end="00:41:28.650" style="s2">when he means that what he means is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.459" end="00:41:30.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a soul shattering experience I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.650" end="00:41:32.130" style="s2">realizing that you are not the center of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.239" end="00:41:33.390" style="s2">your own universe yeah that it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.130" end="00:41:35.610" style="s2">about you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.390" end="00:41:37.320" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s fundamentally that is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.610" end="00:41:39.390" style="s2">heart of the encounter between the ego</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.320" end="00:41:42.390" style="s2">and the self it&#39;s not all about you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.390" end="00:41:44.340" style="s2">you you have a role to play and the ego</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.390" end="00:41:45.840" style="s2">has a role to play the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:47.490" style="s2">has a role to play but you are not the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.840" end="00:41:50.070" style="s2">only game in town and you&#39;re not calling</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.490" end="00:41:52.500" style="s2">the shots what I&#39;m trying to get at ya</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.070" end="00:41:54.630" style="s2">is but it produces that humility also</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.500" end="00:41:55.980" style="s2">right no no and I get that and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.630" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">why that would be if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.980" end="00:41:59.790" style="s2">epistemic lien existentially valuable</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">yeah what I&#39;m trying to get like this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.790" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">the questions getting clear in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:06.570" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship between gaining</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.380" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">that humility towards the self</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.570" end="00:42:10.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not the whole psychic show and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:12.600" style="s2">gaining that humility towards reality so</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.920" end="00:42:14.430" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.600" end="00:42:16.470" style="s2">a clear relationship in vedanta trim</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.430" end="00:42:20.490" style="s2">between rahman is brahman right right</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.470" end="00:42:21.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a becoming more I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.490" end="00:42:23.730" style="s2">use the word all use Ottman because</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:25.590" style="s2">self-centered sounds ridiculous wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.730" end="00:42:28.500" style="s2">area so what&#39;s the relationship become</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.590" end="00:42:31.110" style="s2">between becoming Hockman centered rather</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.500" end="00:42:33.600" style="s2">than egocentric and becoming Anto</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.110" end="00:42:35.610" style="s2">centric rather than egocentric because</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.600" end="00:42:37.340" style="s2">in vedanta they&#39;re clearly allied as</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.610" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">being mutually reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.340" end="00:42:42.150" style="s2">interpenetrating is that a fair thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">also see and young or am i imposing on</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.150" end="00:42:49.290" style="s2">you no I think that&#39;s fair so but but so</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.100" end="00:42:50.970" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a logical identity no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.290" end="00:42:53.370" style="s2">non logical it&#39;s a non logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.970" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.370" end="00:42:57.810" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe yeah non-duality is closer</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the case that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.810" end="00:43:04.500" style="s2">sort of self and ego are the same right</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:07.170" style="s2">but nor is it the case that yeah in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.500" end="00:43:09.660" style="s2">ways they they in some ways they are I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.170" end="00:43:13.230" style="s2">mean right because ego is part of self</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.660" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">and yet distinct from right so there</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.230" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">there is in the work of individuation a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:19.260" style="s2">kind of simultaneous differentiation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:21.420" style="s2">integration a complexification</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.260" end="00:43:22.530" style="s2">complexification and this is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.420" end="00:43:24.600" style="s2">generally when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.530" end="00:43:28.140" style="s2">individuation you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.600" end="00:43:30.660" style="s2">having an encounter that puts you into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.140" end="00:43:32.610" style="s2">state of metaphysical and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.660" end="00:43:34.650" style="s2">epistemological humility relative to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.610" end="00:43:36.270" style="s2">your own psyche and the forces inside of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.650" end="00:43:38.010" style="s2">it and the idea is that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.270" end="00:43:39.780" style="s2">develop different relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.010" end="00:43:41.490" style="s2">these parts of yourself you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.780" end="00:43:43.609" style="s2">things moving in a systems that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.490" end="00:43:46.219" style="s2">understand who and what you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.609" end="00:43:48.410" style="s2">without having to center everything on</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.219" end="00:43:50.839" style="s2">your ego need right but that means</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.410" end="00:43:52.969" style="s2">developing both a sense of identity with</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.839" end="00:43:54.650" style="s2">the system but not direct identity if</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.969" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">you develop direct identity with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.650" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">self in the union system that&#39;s bad no</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.249" style="s2">it&#39;s inflation so I get that so sir I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:03.559" style="s2">not trying to trivialize that yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.249" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">just said it&#39;s important so I get that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.559" end="00:44:07.729" style="s2">you want the non do all right identity</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:09.739" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think the term</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.729" end="00:44:11.930" style="s2">participation is a good term between the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.739" end="00:44:16.369" style="s2">ego and itself what I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.930" end="00:44:18.200" style="s2">is in so again back to the the Bluebird</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.369" end="00:44:19.609" style="s2">critique the existential mode right</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.200" end="00:44:20.890" style="s2">there&#39;s also relation what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.609" end="00:44:23.150" style="s2">relationship between the self and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.890" end="00:44:25.670" style="s2">reality and and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.150" end="00:44:28.309" style="s2">content aspect always sort of trips me</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.670" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">up when I try to get too young and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.309" end="00:44:31.459" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s what I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:35.299" style="s2">weathers a simile in Vedanta it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.459" end="00:44:37.880" style="s2">yes the ego must realize its non-dual at</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.299" end="00:44:39.559" style="s2">one mint with Artman but then once it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.880" end="00:44:41.539" style="s2">does that that affords it in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.559" end="00:44:43.759" style="s2">participatory knowing the realization</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.539" end="00:44:45.619" style="s2">that Atman is Brahman which is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.759" end="00:44:48.229" style="s2">ground of the psyche and the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.619" end="00:44:50.119" style="s2">the and the ground of being right have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.229" end="00:44:51.829" style="s2">deeper and this this was boobers concern</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.119" end="00:44:53.749" style="s2">because Bluebird is concerned he saw God</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.829" end="00:44:55.609" style="s2">is the ground of being and he thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.749" end="00:44:57.589" style="s2">that Jung was reducing God to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.609" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">of the psyche so it sort of depends</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.589" end="00:45:02.630" style="s2">where you want to make your chalk mark</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">on the 50-year line ah please so so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.630" end="00:45:07.430" style="s2">the further along you go it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">I think you&#39;ll always had sympathies</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.430" end="00:45:13.789" style="s2">towards this idea but he somewhat to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:16.699" style="s2">manage the perception of him as a kooky</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.789" end="00:45:19.579" style="s2">mystic and somewhat because he himself</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.699" end="00:45:22.249" style="s2">wanted to rein in his tendencies towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.579" end="00:45:25.880" style="s2">inflation right he starts out with a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.249" end="00:45:28.459" style="s2">relatively grounded sort of biologically</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.880" end="00:45:30.949" style="s2">metaphorically driven idea of what all</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.459" end="00:45:33.229" style="s2">this stuff is so you know when when</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.949" end="00:45:36.109" style="s2">we&#39;re giving this opening idea that like</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.229" end="00:45:38.119" style="s2">you know your your psychological</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.109" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">encounters effectively structure your</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.119" end="00:45:43.039" style="s2">reality and so you have to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:45.650" style="s2">anyway sure right and and it&#39;s as close</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.039" end="00:45:47.239" style="s2">as it comes in some ways right even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.650" end="00:45:48.979" style="s2">you take a completely grounded this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.239" end="00:45:50.269" style="s2">all just happening in your mind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.979" end="00:45:52.099" style="s2">still happening in your mind and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.269" end="00:45:53.690" style="s2">completely changing your mind and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.099" end="00:45:55.099" style="s2">salient to you and what stands out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.690" end="00:45:55.710" style="s2">you and your experience of wonder in it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.099" end="00:45:57.750" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.710" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">important it&#39;s huge right over but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.750" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">could all be contained within your head</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">right in the early part of young as that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.089" style="s2">goes on he&#39;s trying to square it more</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:07.650" style="s2">and more and some of this I mean gets</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.089" end="00:46:09.210" style="s2">into some of the you know for some</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.650" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">people zany or aspects of his work if</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.210" end="00:46:11.790" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:15.540" style="s2">synchronicity hmm we are breaking</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.790" end="00:46:17.580" style="s2">straight out of yeah right so so</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.540" end="00:46:18.570" style="s2">synchronicity I mean lots of people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.580" end="00:46:20.280" style="s2">familiar with this term but</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.570" end="00:46:22.080" style="s2">synchronicity is the idea of meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.280" end="00:46:23.849" style="s2">coincidence and you&#39;ll had a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.080" end="00:46:26.520" style="s2">long-standing interest in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.849" end="00:46:28.680" style="s2">parapsychological material right but</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.520" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">also in these seemingly meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.680" end="00:46:31.830" style="s2">coincidences that he felt were not</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.080" style="s2">adequately explained by standard</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.830" end="00:46:35.750" style="s2">rational sort of you know letting the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.080" end="00:46:39.510" style="s2">air out of his version of the miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.750" end="00:46:40.890" style="s2">yeah very much and as he you know went</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.510" end="00:46:43.320" style="s2">deeper and deeper on attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.890" end="00:46:45.320" style="s2">understand synchronicity which he felt</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.320" end="00:46:47.609" style="s2">was a real thing that needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.320" end="00:46:49.230" style="s2">grappled with and he has some</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.609" end="00:46:51.300" style="s2">predecessors he was he was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.230" end="00:46:52.920" style="s2">familiar with the work of a camera who</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.300" end="00:46:54.390" style="s2">had like the law of sea reality other</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.920" end="00:46:55.950" style="s2">people have been interested in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.390" end="00:46:59.480" style="s2">coincidences as a thing that may</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:47:02.460" style="s2">actually be not coincidental right right</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.480" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">so as he goes deeper down the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.460" end="00:47:09.990" style="s2">hole in terms of synchronicity in terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:12.690" style="s2">of seemingly external manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.990" end="00:47:15.240" style="s2">psycho events so he gets interested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.690" end="00:47:17.130" style="s2">UFOs and he starts to look at like UFO</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.240" end="00:47:18.869" style="s2">sightings and stuff as being but also</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.130" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">you know the appearances of the Virgin</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.869" end="00:47:24.060" style="s2">Mary in the sky this kind of thing as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:25.589" style="s2">being well what is that right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.060" end="00:47:27.390" style="s2">happening because that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.589" end="00:47:29.430" style="s2">be strictly subjective it seems that</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.430" end="00:47:33.030" style="s2">or something what a whole group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.690" end="00:47:34.920" style="s2">people see that and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.030" end="00:47:37.500" style="s2">increasingly interested in the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.920" end="00:47:40.290" style="s2">if indeed it is the case that his notion</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.500" end="00:47:42.540" style="s2">of of this stuff sort of bridges the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.290" end="00:47:44.040" style="s2">mind-body gap that it may stand outside</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.540" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">of that altogether and at that point</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.040" end="00:47:47.849" style="s2">what we&#39;re dealing with the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:49.830" style="s2">entities that&#39;s and so that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.849" end="00:47:52.890" style="s2">the difference you start to get towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.830" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">the end of yo and he&#39;s sort of I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">he&#39;s just caved in Niccolo after his</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:57.960" style="s2">heart attack you know he has a heart</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.510" style="s2">attack near-fatal heart attack and after</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.960" end="00:48:02.430" style="s2">that I think he&#39;s a full on he&#39;s a full</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.510" end="00:48:03.690" style="s2">on mystic he believes that the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.430" end="00:48:06.340" style="s2">that he&#39;s talking about are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.690" end="00:48:11.050" style="s2">fundamental structure of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.340" end="00:48:16.060" style="s2">that to me you know I I&#39;m an aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.050" end="00:48:19.930" style="s2">militant agnostic but most things you</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.060" end="00:48:22.020" style="s2">know so I believe in taking on a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.930" end="00:48:25.120" style="s2">strong degree of epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.020" end="00:48:27.700" style="s2">humility I think that it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.120" end="00:48:30.310" style="s2">hold metaphysics lightly because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.700" end="00:48:32.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know like we can have some degrees</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.310" end="00:48:33.550" style="s2">of plausibility and whatever but like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.020" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">our both our cultural and personal</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.550" end="00:48:37.780" style="s2">emphasis on certainty this is something</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:39.700" style="s2">I might come back to if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.780" end="00:48:42.850" style="s2">about this it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.700" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">control and in as tendency like we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.850" end="00:48:47.170" style="s2">a tendency to shut off lines of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.390" style="s2">possibility so I keep a pretty broad you</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.170" end="00:48:51.400" style="s2">know state of mind but a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.390" end="00:48:53.650" style="s2">that stuff is pretty gone so even for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.400" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">like my tendency is feel like is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.650" end="00:48:57.700" style="s2">really the case that the gesture is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:49:01.780" style="s2">fundamental structure of reality like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.700" end="00:49:03.490" style="s2">maybe maybe that&#39;s the case but but it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.780" end="00:49:05.950" style="s2">seems to me that probably there might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.490" end="00:49:06.670" style="s2">sort of easier to get to explanations</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.950" end="00:49:08.920" style="s2">that are a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.670" end="00:49:10.990" style="s2">naturalistically grounded but don&#39;t rob</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.920" end="00:49:13.630" style="s2">any of that of any of its like wonder or</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.990" end="00:49:15.940" style="s2">impact ok well that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.630" end="00:49:18.220" style="s2">that&#39;s a great segue I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.940" end="00:49:21.070" style="s2">though I you know that I&#39;ve trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.220" end="00:49:22.690" style="s2">develop especially with Leo work on</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.070" end="00:49:26.410" style="s2">plausibility and it&#39;s playing a central</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.690" end="00:49:29.050" style="s2">role and that that&#39;s actually much more</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.410" end="00:49:31.750" style="s2">important than the rather quixotic</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.050" end="00:49:34.420" style="s2">pursuit as you said of certainty and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.750" end="00:49:36.340" style="s2">also tends to link knowledge are more</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.420" end="00:49:39.460" style="s2">clearly to wisdom whereas the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.340" end="00:49:41.110" style="s2">certainty keeps it keeps knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.460" end="00:49:43.240" style="s2">wisdom separate from each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.110" end="00:49:45.490" style="s2">because wisdom is often defined as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.240" end="00:49:47.230" style="s2">how you behave in certain situations of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.490" end="00:49:49.780" style="s2">significant uncertainty and things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.230" end="00:49:52.870" style="s2">that right so I&#39;m invited greement with</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.780" end="00:49:55.240" style="s2">that I but the segue that came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.870" end="00:49:56.950" style="s2">well there&#39;s there&#39;s some threads I want</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.240" end="00:49:58.450" style="s2">to keep Saul just announce them I want</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.950" end="00:50:00.610" style="s2">to come back because now the recollected</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.450" end="00:50:01.870" style="s2">that the Youngs non-theism and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.610" end="00:50:04.300" style="s2">relationship to Christianity is now</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.870" end="00:50:06.820" style="s2">giving even more tortured in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.300" end="00:50:09.190" style="s2">yeah around this and and that eventually</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.820" end="00:50:11.250" style="s2">i think has to bring us back to talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.190" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">about Jordan&#39;s work sure but</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.250" end="00:50:16.200" style="s2">perhaps before I give you a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:21.870" style="s2">address that I&#39;d like to know what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.200" end="00:50:23.870" style="s2">think about you know well the attempts I</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.870" end="00:50:26.280" style="s2">make for example when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.870" end="00:50:29.340" style="s2">aspects of the psyche that are deeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.280" end="00:50:30.780" style="s2">than the ego try know I talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.340" end="00:50:33.240" style="s2">priya going nature of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.780" end="00:50:35.700" style="s2">realization and how it&#39;s this recursive</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.240" end="00:50:37.430" style="s2">and um you know massively</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.700" end="00:50:39.420" style="s2">self-organizing thing and how it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.430" end="00:50:41.700" style="s2">beset us was something that looked like</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.420" end="00:50:43.620" style="s2">dynamic versions of Jungian complexes</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.700" end="00:50:46.350" style="s2">parasitic processing so like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.620" end="00:50:48.120" style="s2">see there and because I take it that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.350" end="00:50:50.580" style="s2">that&#39;s been part of your project right</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.120" end="00:50:52.050" style="s2">and so obviously for egocentric reasons</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.580" end="00:50:53.400" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in the reference also for</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.050" end="00:50:55.980" style="s2">scientific reasons I&#39;m interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.400" end="00:50:58.920" style="s2">what do you see about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.980" end="00:51:02.790" style="s2">between young and relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.920" end="00:51:04.350" style="s2">to put it broadly ok so I can maybe sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.790" end="00:51:07.320" style="s2">of work backwards so you know you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.350" end="00:51:08.370" style="s2">talking about young to some extent and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.320" end="00:51:10.110" style="s2">the relationship between young and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.370" end="00:51:12.840" style="s2">Corbin and the divine double yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.110" end="00:51:17.400" style="s2">the idea of having sort of a trans gel</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.840" end="00:51:19.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s all in episode 48 yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.400" end="00:51:23.790" style="s2">because it&#39;s a I&#39;m influenced by Stan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.980" end="00:51:25.050" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s a it&#39;s I hesitate I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.790" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">want to use the word archetypal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.050" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">this it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:32.730" style="s2">transgenic keeps showing up right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.310" style="s2">the whole point of the book and then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.730" end="00:51:36.270" style="s2">said you it&#39;s clear is ice white clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.310" end="00:51:38.100" style="s2">it&#39;s clear and Corben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.270" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">attend deniable in Corbin and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.100" end="00:51:40.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s very clear until ik you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:42.420" style="s2">with the relationship as he puts it</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.950" end="00:51:44.010" style="s2">between the existential in the essential</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.420" end="00:51:46.200" style="s2">self you know it&#39;s all through</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.010" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">narcissism staying makes a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.200" end="00:51:50.460" style="s2">case it&#39;s it&#39;s present in early forms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:52.590" style="s2">Christianity Gnosticism it&#39;s rife and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.460" end="00:51:55.140" style="s2">then because of narcissism that led me</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.590" end="00:51:58.860" style="s2">to say well maybe plausibly it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.140" end="00:52:03.210" style="s2">Jung right I think it is I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.860" end="00:52:06.660" style="s2">the the notion of divine doubling and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.210" end="00:52:09.210" style="s2">certain amount of like the assumption of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.660" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">the archetype moving moving into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.210" end="00:52:13.740" style="s2">archetype is sort of relatively central</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:16.350" style="s2">to the the on-the-ground practice of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.740" end="00:52:18.630" style="s2">depth psychology and what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.350" end="00:52:21.450" style="s2">that moving into the archetype so so</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.630" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">there is a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.450" end="00:52:25.890" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll give it I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:27.869" style="s2">example so so when you&#39;ll we you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.890" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">the idea of the persona right you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.869" end="00:52:33.510" style="s2">the ego the ego is your conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:36.119" style="s2">in some sense and it&#39;s it&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.510" end="00:52:38.280" style="s2">you seem to yourself separate from that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.119" end="00:52:40.109" style="s2">is the interface that you have with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.280" end="00:52:41.970" style="s2">social world right and so the persona</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.109" end="00:52:44.369" style="s2">derived from the theatrical mask right</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.970" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">and and it&#39;s an interface insofar as it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.369" end="00:52:48.270" style="s2">really is bi-directional you both put</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:50.309" style="s2">things through it in a sense right it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.270" end="00:52:52.260" style="s2">reveals then it can also filters but it</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.309" end="00:52:54.510" style="s2">also filters so so it contains your</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.260" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">social rule right you have to put on</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.510" end="00:52:58.530" style="s2">certain types of masks to do certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.710" end="00:52:58.950" style="s2">kinds of things and you we take this as</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.530" end="00:53:00.780" style="s2">a given</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.950" end="00:53:02.430" style="s2">generally speaking right like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.780" end="00:53:03.900" style="s2">if you&#39;re a lawyer and you&#39;ve got court</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.430" end="00:53:05.069" style="s2">you have to have certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.900" end="00:53:06.900" style="s2">personality television law</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.069" end="00:53:09.780" style="s2">notwithstanding you have to have certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.900" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">kinds of persona in order to do it same</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.780" end="00:53:13.770" style="s2">thing goes for the Academy yeah being a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:15.990" style="s2">professor totally or being a student</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.770" end="00:53:17.609" style="s2">right by the time students get into</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.990" end="00:53:19.319" style="s2">undergrad none of them are standing on</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.609" end="00:53:21.150" style="s2">their desk and screaming yeah or if they</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.319" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">are it&#39;s a highly anomalous event I hate</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.150" end="00:53:26.339" style="s2">their so you know the ability to conform</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">to the expectations and social rules and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.339" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">stuff is part of fitting in its both</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:36.119" style="s2">right but also we push our individuality</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:38.309" style="s2">out so it&#39;s a bit like if you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.119" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">know sartorius artists current</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.309" end="00:53:42.660" style="s2">Carlisle&#39;s book so it&#39;s a Bono Carla</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:46.109" style="s2">yeah yeah but about the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.660" end="00:53:48.089" style="s2">clothes right it&#39;s very funny right look</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.109" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">but one of the things that you get into</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.089" end="00:53:52.200" style="s2">this with persona is you know clothing</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:54.540" style="s2">reveals and it conceals right has that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.200" end="00:53:56.069" style="s2">that dual high daguerreian kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.540" end="00:53:57.450" style="s2">quality to it reveals and conceals we</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.069" end="00:54:03.569" style="s2">say things about ourselves but we also</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.450" end="00:54:09.390" style="s2">hide ourselves right okay so so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.569" end="00:54:12.359" style="s2">sort of looking at that right we can we</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.390" end="00:54:13.710" style="s2">can I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.359" end="00:54:15.900" style="s2">best example now that I started to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.710" end="00:54:17.790" style="s2">into it moving into the archetype yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.900" end="00:54:19.740" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if I should be moving into</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.790" end="00:54:21.450" style="s2">the archetype or not I want take a break</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.740" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">here no I&#39;m just thinking about it for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.450" end="00:54:27.630" style="s2">second because if I start moving into</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">persona specifically no I&#39;m gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.630" end="00:54:31.740" style="s2">into having to unpack all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.430" end="00:54:34.950" style="s2">I think maybe in fact I should move back</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.740" end="00:54:35.510" style="s2">to talking about the divine double and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.950" end="00:54:37.700" style="s2">cell</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.510" end="00:54:40.340" style="s2">okay instead okay okay so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.700" end="00:54:42.440" style="s2">will do instead okay so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.340" end="00:54:44.210" style="s2">specific thing that you sort of unpack</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.440" end="00:54:46.760" style="s2">around around that right which is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.210" end="00:54:48.590" style="s2">idea that the divine double is standing</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.760" end="00:54:49.850" style="s2">in aspirationally yeah I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.590" end="00:54:53.960" style="s2">get I was trying to link you and his</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.850" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">idea to calories idea of aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.960" end="00:54:59.180" style="s2">because because it does it does a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.369" style="s2">work because Callard has a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.180" end="00:55:03.830" style="s2">argument that this aspiration has to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.369" end="00:55:05.960" style="s2">part of what we mean by rationality yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.830" end="00:55:07.790" style="s2">she indicates but does not develop a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.960" end="00:55:10.609" style="s2">psychology around it that it has to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.790" end="00:55:12.140" style="s2">this symbolic thing it had mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.609" end="00:55:13.609" style="s2">the persona was actually helpful even</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.140" end="00:55:15.740" style="s2">though you&#39;re not gonna go in it because</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.609" end="00:55:17.090" style="s2">when you&#39;re aspiring you need something</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.740" end="00:55:19.340" style="s2">that a Janus face like that it has to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.090" end="00:55:20.840" style="s2">that&#39;s right it has to draw you within</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.340" end="00:55:22.700" style="s2">the frame that you&#39;re in and the person</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.840" end="00:55:24.560" style="s2">that you are but it also has to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.700" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">beyond yes right and normatively</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.560" end="00:55:28.190" style="s2">challenging you to become the person you</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.869" style="s2">you&#39;re aspiring to be okay so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.190" end="00:55:31.310" style="s2">leave it all my stumbly processing</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.869" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the process of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.310" end="00:55:36.170" style="s2">that&#39;s good okay so that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:39.020" style="s2">I was getting at is that when we move</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.170" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">into persona we start out by faking it</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.020" end="00:55:42.619" style="s2">until we make it we dawn it but persona</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.330" style="s2">can become too tight it starts out</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.619" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">typically being aspirational so this</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.330" end="00:55:47.960" style="s2">like the classic thing right early</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:50.660" style="s2">undergrad you know philosophy papers</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.960" end="00:55:52.850" style="s2">used to get slammed for using jargon and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.660" end="00:55:54.619" style="s2">sort of awkward right they&#39;re awkward</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.850" end="00:55:56.210" style="s2">but the idea is they&#39;re trying on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.619" end="00:55:57.859" style="s2">form and of course it&#39;s awkward because</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.210" end="00:55:59.240" style="s2">they&#39;re imperfectly emulating and if</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.859" end="00:56:01.220" style="s2">they could perfectly emulate it they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.240" end="00:56:02.390" style="s2">already be doing it right right they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.220" end="00:56:04.520" style="s2">already know what they were doing right</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.390" end="00:56:05.960" style="s2">first we do it clumsily that serious</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.520" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">play that I&#39;ve been talking exactly</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.960" end="00:56:09.890" style="s2">exactly okay so the persona is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:12.290" style="s2">an interface point for that but it can</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.890" end="00:56:15.320" style="s2">come to fit too tightly there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.290" end="00:56:17.750" style="s2">correspondingly a kind of inner right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.320" end="00:56:20.210" style="s2">the corresponding point to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.750" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">persona which interfaces us with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.210" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">world of the social world specifically</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:28.490" style="s2">the anima or animus right the oh so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:31.160" style="s2">the internal interface that&#39;s right okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.490" end="00:56:32.359" style="s2">yeah which is why so you know he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.160" end="00:56:33.320" style="s2">knew that about the anima I didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.359" end="00:56:34.760" style="s2">understand it that way that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.320" end="00:56:36.920" style="s2">helpful yeah so the it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.760" end="00:56:39.290" style="s2">understand but that&#39;s why it&#39;s the soul</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.920" end="00:56:40.369" style="s2">and it&#39;s distinct from the self this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.290" end="00:56:42.440" style="s2">one of the things that I wanted to point</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.369" end="00:56:45.530" style="s2">out with your divine double thing Isis</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.440" end="00:56:48.200" style="s2">so it has a psychopomp ik function when</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.530" end="00:56:48.890" style="s2">you start interfacing with it is so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.200" end="00:56:50.900" style="s2">anima</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.890" end="00:56:53.079" style="s2">is the soul it&#39;s the interface between</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.900" end="00:56:55.759" style="s2">the ego and the cell that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.079" end="00:56:57.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it is the psychopomp yes a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.759" end="00:56:59.390" style="s2">psychopomp is something that leads you</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.470" end="00:57:01.430" style="s2">into right into the afterlife or the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.390" end="00:57:01.880" style="s2">underworld or between worlds or what</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.430" end="00:57:04.730" style="s2">have you</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.880" end="00:57:07.099" style="s2">yes so so the Contra sexual soul image</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.730" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">which I just force Orton to soul right</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.099" end="00:57:13.700" style="s2">right is that is to the inner world what</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">the persona is to the outer world oh so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.700" end="00:57:16.339" style="s2">that means they must have a strange</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:18.920" style="s2">relationship to well they have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.339" end="00:57:20.749" style="s2">compensatory relationship and so where</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.920" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">the ego and the shadow for instance are</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.749" end="00:57:23.720" style="s2">compensatory to some extent right they</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:26.660" style="s2">that it&#39;s an either/or proposition</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.720" end="00:57:30.170" style="s2">what&#39;s in each to some extent that turns</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.660" end="00:57:33.170" style="s2">up in persona and soul and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.170" end="00:57:35.869" style="s2">the ways that that I and I think a fair</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.170" end="00:57:37.009" style="s2">number of other sort of neo unions try</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.869" end="00:57:38.989" style="s2">to look at this so that we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.009" end="00:57:40.309" style="s2">into so much gender essentialism right</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.989" end="00:57:41.989" style="s2">around like the inner woman and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.309" end="00:57:43.849" style="s2">inner man and like that stuff gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.989" end="00:57:46.039" style="s2">confusing given you know sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.849" end="00:57:48.470" style="s2">modern thinking on this right sure but</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.039" end="00:57:51.589" style="s2">if instead it&#39;s the case that all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.470" end="00:57:53.630" style="s2">your externally focused you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.589" end="00:57:55.970" style="s2">masculine traits your ideas about what</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.630" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">it is to be you know like I&#39;m a man and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.970" end="00:57:59.210" style="s2">this is how I present myself and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.499" style="s2">whatever the corresponding traits drift</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.210" end="00:58:02.749" style="s2">inwards and they become part of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.499" end="00:58:04.369" style="s2">inner relatedness and because there</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.749" end="00:58:06.230" style="s2">tends to be sort of us you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.369" end="00:58:08.119" style="s2">statistical cultural clustering around</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.230" end="00:58:09.769" style="s2">this stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.119" end="00:58:12.140" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s sort of gender</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.769" end="00:58:13.819" style="s2">essential in the genetic sense it is in</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.140" end="00:58:16.029" style="s2">a cultural sense and so you&#39;ll tend to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.819" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">get right those traits accumulating okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.029" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">that figure that sort of soul figure</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:25.549" style="s2">yeah I think is closer to what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:27.079" style="s2">by the divine double-double and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.549" end="00:58:28.970" style="s2">there are a few doubles there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.079" end="00:58:30.410" style="s2">doubles and doubles and twins that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.970" end="00:58:33.019" style="s2">young as full of that kind of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.410" end="00:58:35.420" style="s2">the shadow has that quality too so what</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.019" end="00:58:36.499" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is I was being I agree</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.420" end="00:58:39.259" style="s2">with you now I think your critique is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.499" end="00:58:40.999" style="s2">excellent because in fact the what</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.259" end="00:58:43.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve just done Maps better on to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.999" end="00:58:46.039" style="s2">original use so the divine double isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.690" end="00:58:48.769" style="s2">ultimately the God beyond all possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.039" end="00:58:51.380" style="s2">gods the divine double is the psychopomp</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.769" end="00:58:53.239" style="s2">ik figure it is nevertheless but you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.380" end="00:58:54.829" style="s2">have a non logical identity with yes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.239" end="00:58:56.779" style="s2">so did Stan&#39;s point is that your</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.829" end="00:58:59.089" style="s2">individual not an individual right your</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.779" end="00:59:02.600" style="s2">individual and that the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.089" end="00:59:05.420" style="s2">with the divine double actually it</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.600" end="00:59:06.950" style="s2">draws you beyond now the thing is so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.420" end="00:59:08.120" style="s2">can I think you&#39;re right and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.950" end="00:59:09.770" style="s2">see and there are other versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.120" end="00:59:11.780" style="s2">right and we&#39;re curious young talks at</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.770" end="00:59:14.120" style="s2">great length about more curious and more</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.780" end="00:59:16.280" style="s2">curious is a kind of version of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.120" end="00:59:18.440" style="s2">divine double that&#39;s even closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.280" end="00:59:21.110" style="s2">center of being it partakes in all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.440" end="00:59:22.820" style="s2">the paradoxical yeah sort of this it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.110" end="00:59:24.740" style="s2">hermaphroditic and you see you see that</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.820" end="00:59:28.310" style="s2">in the Gnostics - right as you get as</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.740" end="00:59:29.720" style="s2">you move I want to say higher but</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.310" end="00:59:30.980" style="s2">there&#39;s all metaphors yeah this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.720" end="00:59:33.830" style="s2">through the divine double so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.980" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s important because that do that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.830" end="00:59:41.540" style="s2">me then does strike me as perhaps maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:43.340" style="s2">I got to go back and see what how Dooley</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.540" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">is playing with these two that seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.340" end="00:59:45.950" style="s2">like there&#39;s although that I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:47.570" style="s2">they&#39;re both invoking the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.950" end="00:59:51.380" style="s2">your on this divine double is more</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.570" end="00:59:52.700" style="s2">closely Gnostic than telexes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.380" end="00:59:54.350" style="s2">right now I mean till it clearly has</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.700" end="00:59:55.880" style="s2">narcissism in and he talks about the God</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.350" end="00:59:58.940" style="s2">beyond the god of theism and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.880" end="01:00:02.900" style="s2">but the the divine double is so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.940" end="01:00:04.820" style="s2">like Tillich draws on the Gnostics in</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.900" end="01:00:06.170" style="s2">order to I mean you know the the mid</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.820" end="01:00:09.980" style="s2">twentieth century is like the high-water</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.170" end="01:00:11.510" style="s2">mark for theology as the locus where we</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.980" end="01:00:13.190" style="s2">were going to perform some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.510" end="01:00:14.180" style="s2">cultural Redemption yeah and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.190" end="01:00:17.150" style="s2">think we&#39;re there anymore</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.180" end="01:00:18.470" style="s2">I mean now countless Catholics including</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.150" end="01:00:20.600" style="s2">some friends of mine will disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.470" end="01:00:22.970" style="s2">me but it seems to me like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.600" end="01:00:24.800" style="s2">really where this is going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.970" end="01:00:27.560" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to get a modern</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.800" end="01:00:30.110" style="s2">theologian doing this so but Tillich</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.560" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">clearly falls into that arc yeah and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.110" end="01:00:33.530" style="s2">seems to me that he draws on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:36.380" style="s2">Gnostics he&#39;s pulling things from them</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.530" end="01:00:39.230" style="s2">in order to run his project but you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.380" end="01:00:41.570" style="s2">one was just a Gnostic yeah he&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.230" end="01:00:44.920" style="s2">Gnostic young got you know to an</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.570" end="01:00:47.630" style="s2">important extent hammered with an</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.920" end="01:00:52.100" style="s2">experience which he then attempted to</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.630" end="01:00:53.960" style="s2">sort out so so we let&#39;s remember I want</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.100" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">you to eventually get back to how does</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.960" end="01:00:58.520" style="s2">this bridge between young and relevance</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:01:00.800" style="s2">realization so but also I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.520" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">put another pin given what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.800" end="01:01:04.550" style="s2">and I mean IIIi was a little bit bold</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:06.470" style="s2">but now you made me feel more confident</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.550" end="01:01:08.510" style="s2">in the boldness I I said the formula for</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.470" end="01:01:11.090" style="s2">young is cop is caught plus nost x</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.510" end="01:01:12.950" style="s2">equals young with a sprinkling of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.090" end="01:01:14.080" style="s2">Schopenhauer things like a sprinkling of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.950" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.080" end="01:01:17.740" style="s2">so for her fair enough but given what</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:20.110" style="s2">you just said and then given of course</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.740" end="01:01:22.330" style="s2">the very tortured relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.110" end="01:01:24.070" style="s2">narcissism into stanity this again makes</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.330" end="01:01:26.350" style="s2">the relationship between young and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.070" end="01:01:28.570" style="s2">Christianity even more fraught sure I</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.350" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">mean look at its most basic right you</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.570" end="01:01:33.220" style="s2">has a lot of interest in respect in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:35.170" style="s2">Christian symbolism right but as part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.220" end="01:01:37.210" style="s2">a broader subset he doesn&#39;t identify</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.170" end="01:01:39.640" style="s2">Christian symbolism as being sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.210" end="01:01:41.740" style="s2">unique unto itself right he sees it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.640" end="01:01:44.110" style="s2">part of a broader set of rebirth and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.740" end="01:01:45.220" style="s2">resurrection and right this is your</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.110" end="01:01:46.900" style="s2">point about him ultimately being a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.220" end="01:01:49.930" style="s2">non-theist yeah that&#39;s right and but</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.900" end="01:01:52.170" style="s2">also that he you know he sees it as part</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.930" end="01:01:54.700" style="s2">of a tradition so it&#39;s sort of the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.170" end="01:01:56.290" style="s2">flowering within our age of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.700" end="01:01:58.030" style="s2">tradition right the fish and so on and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.290" end="01:02:03.040" style="s2">so forth but really has lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.030" end="01:02:05.050" style="s2">parallels and precedents right but so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.040" end="01:02:07.750" style="s2">this is this overlaps sorry for interest</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.050" end="01:02:10.930" style="s2">because surely who you know hmm I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.750" end="01:02:14.050" style="s2">he uses young as a basis for making a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.930" end="01:02:17.350" style="s2">critique of Christianity right well so</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.050" end="01:02:17.980" style="s2">so you does clearly have okay I can give</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.350" end="01:02:21.040" style="s2">you one example</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.980" end="01:02:23.800" style="s2">you&#39;ll rejects out of hand the concept</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.040" end="01:02:25.630" style="s2">of privacy Oh bony right right throws it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.800" end="01:02:27.400" style="s2">right out so right this is this is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.630" end="01:02:29.500" style="s2">Augustinian idea please go ahead story</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.400" end="01:02:31.600" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s Augustine&#39;s idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.500" end="01:02:33.010" style="s2">way to understand evil is not as having</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.600" end="01:02:35.080" style="s2">any metaphysical substance in and of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.010" end="01:02:37.120" style="s2">itself rather it is merely the absence</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.080" end="01:02:39.520" style="s2">of good right provision above me and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.120" end="01:02:41.080" style="s2">the idea is there&#39;s just God and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.520" end="01:02:42.070" style="s2">there are places that God you know I</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.080" end="01:02:45.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s not shining as brightly</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.070" end="01:02:48.850" style="s2">yes yeah it&#39;s the idea and young throws</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.550" end="01:02:51.430" style="s2">that out he is right off the bat like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.850" end="01:02:53.530" style="s2">duelist in this sense he says no no like</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.430" end="01:02:56.200" style="s2">you have to treat these things as having</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.530" end="01:02:59.620" style="s2">their own solidity and force and motion</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.200" end="01:03:00.730" style="s2">and purpose no the devil needs his due</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.620" end="01:03:03.780" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve made this point at the very</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.730" end="01:03:06.010" style="s2">beginning right so I mean that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.780" end="01:03:07.240" style="s2">central to Jungian thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.010" end="01:03:09.250" style="s2">something will actually come back to if</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.240" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">we talk about sort of the shadow yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.250" end="01:03:13.920" style="s2">and the way that the shadow works in</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:16.300" style="s2">this sense so you know yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.920" end="01:03:17.980" style="s2">immediately and and he has some other</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.300" end="01:03:20.110" style="s2">fairly deep critiques if you read his</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.980" end="01:03:22.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a thin little book and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.110" end="01:03:23.950" style="s2">strange book it&#39;s interesting but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.300" end="01:03:26.380" style="s2">strange right the answer to Joe yeah of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.950" end="01:03:27.390" style="s2">course right the answer to job is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.380" end="01:03:30.420" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.390" end="01:03:33.840" style="s2">attempt to synthesize together the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.420" end="01:03:37.170" style="s2">meaning of Christianity together with</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.840" end="01:03:38.640" style="s2">sort of our current you know age and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.170" end="01:03:39.930" style="s2">what that means and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.640" end="01:03:42.060" style="s2">that you get in the deep young is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.930" end="01:03:44.100" style="s2">idea that the archetypes sort of aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.060" end="01:03:45.840" style="s2">exactly totally outside of time and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.100" end="01:03:48.090" style="s2">space because they evolved culturally</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.840" end="01:03:50.070" style="s2">mhm and so you know where we might talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.090" end="01:03:52.800" style="s2">about like the axial age or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.070" end="01:03:54.930" style="s2">Young tags of stuff you know with sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.800" end="01:03:57.030" style="s2">of these two thousand year or you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.930" end="01:03:59.340" style="s2">procession of the right whatever this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.030" end="01:04:01.020" style="s2">called the cosmic seasons right no</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.340" end="01:04:02.880" style="s2">cosmic months or something something</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.020" end="01:04:04.890" style="s2">like that whatever it&#39;s astrology right</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.880" end="01:04:07.020" style="s2">so so he identifies he&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.890" end="01:04:08.670" style="s2">thousand year long cycles and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.020" end="01:04:12.090" style="s2">things that he says in the answer to job</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.670" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">so right story of job you know did you</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.090" end="01:04:16.020" style="s2">do job in the series no I didn&#39;t okay so</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:20.610" style="s2">a story of job right it&#39;s it&#39;s a late</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.020" end="01:04:22.619" style="s2">Old Testament story and what you have is</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.610" end="01:04:24.119" style="s2">God and the devil are sitting around on</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.619" end="01:04:26.490" style="s2">a mountainside this is before they were</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.119" end="01:04:27.930" style="s2">like I don&#39;t see what did I say the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.490" end="01:04:29.430" style="s2">devil oh yeah okay saving you right it</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.930" end="01:04:31.290" style="s2">was still the job description yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.430" end="01:04:32.910" style="s2">God and the adversary the angel that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.290" end="01:04:35.609" style="s2">does the adversarial stuff are sitting</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.910" end="01:04:37.170" style="s2">on the side of a mountain and basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.609" end="01:04:41.190" style="s2">they get into an argument about whether</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.170" end="01:04:43.980" style="s2">or not if sufficiently bad things happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.190" end="01:04:46.650" style="s2">to job God&#39;s faithful servant job will</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.980" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">denounce him and they take bats you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.650" end="01:04:51.690" style="s2">Satan is like I bet you I can make his</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">day sufficiently terrible right this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.690" end="01:04:56.730" style="s2">just like the bet in the dark night</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:58.859" style="s2">right one bit one bad day we&#39;re all one</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.730" end="01:05:02.130" style="s2">bad day so so they make this pact and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.859" end="01:05:02.550" style="s2">gods like your on and then with sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.130" end="01:05:05.550" style="s2">gods</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.550" end="01:05:07.680" style="s2">go ahead he destroys jobs life give some</p>

<p begin="01:06:14.250" end="01:06:18.089" style="s2">interpreted that is that what God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.050" end="01:06:21.390" style="s2">doing is inducing a numinous experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.089" end="01:06:23.460" style="s2">and then and part of the response yes to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.390" end="01:06:25.140" style="s2">the problem of evil is not a any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.460" end="01:06:27.180" style="s2">philosophical proposition or argument</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.140" end="01:06:29.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s like look here&#39;s the numinous</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.180" end="01:06:30.420" style="s2">and you go it&#39;s like in like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.310" end="01:06:33.060" style="s2">like that scene in Joe versus the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.420" end="01:06:34.859" style="s2">volcano you know Oh God whose name I do</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.060" end="01:06:36.599" style="s2">not know thank you for my life because</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.599" end="01:06:39.089" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t answer the fact that he</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.010" end="01:06:40.380" style="s2">believes he has some kind of brain</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.089" end="01:06:42.390" style="s2">cancer it doesn&#39;t resolve any of his</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.380" end="01:06:43.020" style="s2">problems but he becomes grateful for his</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.390" end="01:06:44.400" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.020" end="01:06:46.109" style="s2">because of the encounter with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.400" end="01:06:47.910" style="s2">numinous and that&#39;s the answer right</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.109" end="01:06:50.190" style="s2">beaut beautiful and terrible like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.910" end="01:06:53.609" style="s2">see all who look on me she&#39;ll love me</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.190" end="01:06:55.140" style="s2">and despair yeah yeah so for sure it I</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.609" end="01:06:57.089" style="s2">think that&#39;s one aspect but the thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.140" end="01:06:59.369" style="s2">that young tags on specifically okay is</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.089" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">this particular exchange because what</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.369" end="01:07:03.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll reads into this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:06.230" style="s2">encounter where it&#39;s like Joe basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.720" end="01:07:09.240" style="s2">did nothing to deserve this yes and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.230" end="01:07:13.080" style="s2">after the encounter where job does kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.240" end="01:07:15.180" style="s2">of knuckle under God feels remorse we</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.080" end="01:07:16.530" style="s2">have a kind of an Old Testament figure</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.180" end="01:07:18.750" style="s2">cuz you know Old Testament God is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.530" end="01:07:20.460" style="s2">funny capricious figure right Regenesis</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.750" end="01:07:22.500" style="s2">in us the Gnostics made a big deal</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.460" end="01:07:24.750" style="s2">exactly and so this is a very gnostic</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.500" end="01:07:27.720" style="s2">interpretation we have sort of old</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.750" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">nobodaddy right right who&#39;s throwing his</p>

<p begin="01:07:35.099" end="01:07:39.060" style="s2">reconcile right hard to chew through and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.410" end="01:07:42.660" style="s2">this was part of the Gnostic problem and</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.060" end="01:07:46.320" style="s2">in the book of Job Young sees a moment</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.660" end="01:07:48.150" style="s2">where that God feels remorse and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.320" end="01:07:50.190" style="s2">for him is the moment where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.150" end="01:07:53.200" style="s2">necessary to then incarnate in the flesh</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.190" end="01:07:54.760" style="s2">so that you can suffer he</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.970" end="01:08:06.460" style="s2">Orthodox Christian idea in any way so</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.660" end="01:08:08.980" style="s2">the ideal Italy Gnostic though very</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.460" end="01:08:11.410" style="s2">deeply Gnostic so ya know I think young</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.980" end="01:08:13.540" style="s2">is you know whether or not he would have</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.410" end="01:08:14.740" style="s2">had the courage all along to say that he</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.540" end="01:08:17.050" style="s2">was a gnostic because he was already</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.740" end="01:08:19.090" style="s2">four plastered with a lot of labels as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.050" end="01:08:20.470" style="s2">weirdo yeah yeah whether or not he would</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.090" end="01:08:22.390" style="s2">have had the courage I mean one of his</p>

<p begin="01:08:28.030" end="01:08:32.530" style="s2">reads like in Gnostic texts and trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.730" end="01:08:34.630" style="s2">to read the Gnostic Gospels is it very</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.530" end="01:08:36.490" style="s2">tough that for the gospel of truth or</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.630" end="01:08:38.170" style="s2">the gospel of thomas gospel okay the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.490" end="01:08:40.900" style="s2">Gospel of Thomas is pretty good because</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.170" end="01:08:43.510" style="s2">it just puts like a clarifying spin on</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.900" end="01:08:45.400" style="s2">the synoptic Gospels it&#39;s like nice</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.510" end="01:08:47.320" style="s2">little aphorisms that&#39;s good but like</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.140" end="01:09:08.410" style="s2">getting you&#39;re getting a different</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.280" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">interpretation of the sacred not as</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.410" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">something that should be fixed right but</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:13.480" style="s2">is something that should become constant</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:16.000" style="s2">ly transgressed that&#39;s right which gets</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.480" end="01:09:18.010" style="s2">us back to the symbols yes right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.000" end="01:09:19.030" style="s2">well so the inexhaustibility and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.010" end="01:09:20.710" style="s2">trans Jack TIFF Nessa</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.030" end="01:09:22.270" style="s2">yeah when I read seven sermons of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.710" end="01:09:24.310" style="s2">Dead that young book I own it and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.270" end="01:09:25.810" style="s2">read it a bunch what I see there is not</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.310" end="01:09:28.060" style="s2">something that&#39;s easy for me to directly</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.810" end="01:09:30.070" style="s2">connect to but I can empathize with</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.060" end="01:09:32.830" style="s2">because I&#39;ve had comparable experiences</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.070" end="01:09:35.410" style="s2">of poetry I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve had write</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.830" end="01:09:38.710" style="s2">automatic writing poetry things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.410" end="01:09:40.690" style="s2">that came through me or that was the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.710" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">felt sense right of course at some level</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.690" end="01:09:45.280" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that biologically I produced it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:46.420" style="s2">but that was not the felt sense the felt</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.280" end="01:09:48.730" style="s2">sense was that it was a thing that</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.420" end="01:09:51.250" style="s2">happened to and through me yeah and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.730" end="01:09:53.620" style="s2">contained sort of massive right</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.250" end="01:09:55.300" style="s2">archetypal structure to it yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.620" end="01:09:56.920" style="s2">a distinction that Tanabe talks about</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.300" end="01:09:58.480" style="s2">about self power and other power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.920" end="01:10:00.670" style="s2">crucial to certain aspects of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.480" end="01:10:02.260" style="s2">and right effort is about getting the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.670" end="01:10:04.280" style="s2">balance between self power and other</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.260" end="01:10:06.380" style="s2">power right</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.280" end="01:10:08.960" style="s2">so I mean you invoked transductive &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.380" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">you invoked you know inexhaustibility to</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.960" end="01:10:12.710" style="s2">invoke salience so try to bring it back</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:17.210" style="s2">to again right like you okay so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.710" end="01:10:18.920" style="s2">give them loking maybe I&#39;ll give you the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.210" end="01:10:21.770" style="s2">simple simple so this is how I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.920" end="01:10:23.420" style="s2">about it I wouldn&#39;t want to put words in</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.770" end="01:10:26.660" style="s2">young&#39;s mouth necessarily but this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.420" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">how i think about it i think about so</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.660" end="01:10:31.820" style="s2">you know you talked I think in episode</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:35.210" style="s2">32 your series about Montague and mutual</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.820" end="01:10:37.070" style="s2">modeling okay and I often think about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.210" end="01:10:37.790" style="s2">in those terms and in type what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.070" end="01:10:39.620" style="s2">talking about when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.790" end="01:10:42.230" style="s2">typology but in the simplest sense I</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.620" end="01:10:44.600" style="s2">think about it in this way there are a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.230" end="01:10:47.870" style="s2">series of encounters that I can have</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.600" end="01:10:50.390" style="s2">within my own mind okay with figures</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.870" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">that compose my psyche but are not</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.390" end="01:10:54.890" style="s2">identical with the person I would call</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:56.930" style="s2">Anderson but they&#39;re important parts of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.890" end="01:10:59.690" style="s2">my functioning those include things like</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.930" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">the internal neutral models I developed</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.690" end="01:11:02.720" style="s2">for my parents right right right</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.250" style="s2">who you know and this is the point that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.720" end="01:11:05.720" style="s2">I sometimes make it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.250" end="01:11:07.730" style="s2">an area where Freud was right right</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.720" end="01:11:10.010" style="s2">theory of mind we know that we have</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.730" end="01:11:11.900" style="s2">theory of mind for other people before</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.010" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">we have it for ourselves yes and under</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.900" end="01:11:15.500" style="s2">mutual modeling we know that</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:16.760" style="s2">evolutionarily speaking it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.500" end="01:11:19.100" style="s2">crucial that you be able to internalize</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.760" end="01:11:20.540" style="s2">your parents yep often in fact your</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.100" end="01:11:22.070" style="s2">enormous frustration as a young adult</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.540" end="01:11:24.380" style="s2">you get a lot of your metacognitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.070" end="01:11:25.610" style="s2">abilities through the Gonski and what</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.380" end="01:11:27.080" style="s2">what you put those two things together</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.610" end="01:11:28.430" style="s2">and what that means is your parents have</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.080" end="01:11:28.850" style="s2">been living in your head longer than you</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.430" end="01:11:30.680" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.850" end="01:11:32.150" style="s2">yes oh that&#39;s a good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.680" end="01:11:33.500" style="s2">that&#39;s very provocative right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.150" end="01:11:35.810" style="s2">that and in that sense like for an</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.500" end="01:11:37.310" style="s2">impact attachment right or oh man I came</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.810" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">to that&#39;s Jeff McDonald&#39;s work and other</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.310" end="01:11:41.480" style="s2">people&#39;s were totally right so so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.970" style="s2">know you get that you get general</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.480" end="01:11:45.830" style="s2">general kind of concepts of type and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.970" end="01:11:48.050" style="s2">talk about type people get very you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.830" end="01:11:50.630" style="s2">worked up about it but really type is</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.050" end="01:11:52.730" style="s2">just category you know and category is</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.630" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">essential to doing any kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.730" end="01:11:56.120" style="s2">thinking manipulating things in classes</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:57.530" style="s2">that&#39;s type you know the fact that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.120" end="01:11:59.300" style="s2">not interacting with every cat as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.530" end="01:12:00.620" style="s2">radical individual but I have some basic</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.300" end="01:12:02.210" style="s2">idea of where a cat wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.620" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">scratched and not be scratched</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.210" end="01:12:06.980" style="s2">I might sometimes get surprised right</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:09.260" style="s2">but for the most part right I form type</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.980" end="01:12:11.330" style="s2">likewise we interact with type on a day</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.260" end="01:12:13.880" style="s2">to day basis all the time and recognize</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.330" end="01:12:15.140" style="s2">in other people even when we don&#39;t on</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.880" end="01:12:16.300" style="s2">ourselves right when we say somebody has</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.140" end="01:12:17.980" style="s2">a romantic type</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.300" end="01:12:19.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s recently been put on</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.980" end="01:12:22.600" style="s2">empirical footing people really do ya</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.870" end="01:12:24.310" style="s2">have a romantic type right and to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.600" end="01:12:26.290" style="s2">that romantic type is intertwined with</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.310" end="01:12:28.540" style="s2">people&#39;s pathologies of attachment and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.290" end="01:12:31.750" style="s2">romance would be understating it even</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.540" end="01:12:34.620" style="s2">right okay interject you just rocked an</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.750" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">insight into sure okay so if we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.620" end="01:12:41.410" style="s2">sort of categorical relationships is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:43.060" style="s2">part of young getting us to not make a</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.410" end="01:12:45.010" style="s2">modal confusion and shift from a</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.060" end="01:12:49.450" style="s2">category and I get with our inner life</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.010" end="01:12:51.400" style="s2">to an eye though yes ah ah yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.450" end="01:12:54.670" style="s2">why it&#39;s about developing relationships</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.400" end="01:12:59.260" style="s2">ah right so you come to a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.670" end="01:13:00.810" style="s2">and this is why often I think people you</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.260" end="01:13:04.930" style="s2">know the archetypes aren&#39;t things we</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.810" end="01:13:06.550" style="s2">have exactly no no no they&#39;re there and</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.930" end="01:13:09.640" style="s2">sort of they&#39;re somewhat fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.550" end="01:13:11.350" style="s2">structures but the but the the fundament</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.640" end="01:13:14.050" style="s2">of the structure is that they will form</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.350" end="01:13:15.850" style="s2">not the specific contents and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.050" end="01:13:17.530" style="s2">encounter those specific contents in</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.850" end="01:13:19.740" style="s2">order to know ourselves and those</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.530" end="01:13:25.480" style="s2">specific contents are best encountered</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.740" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">as people sort of yeah not quite but</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.480" end="01:13:30.040" style="s2">sort of yeah those but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:32.920" style="s2">right no I don&#39;t know I&#39;m on the fence</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.040" end="01:13:35.860" style="s2">personally about whether these aspects</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.920" end="01:13:38.040" style="s2">of our mind possess that possess their</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.860" end="01:13:40.660" style="s2">own subjectivity intrinsically or</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.040" end="01:13:43.300" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the case that through the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.660" end="01:13:45.550" style="s2">practices that we engage in we allow</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.300" end="01:13:47.770" style="s2">them to draw on the machinery of</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.550" end="01:13:50.110" style="s2">subjectivity whether we person them</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.770" end="01:13:52.060" style="s2">right we sort of allow them to exact</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.110" end="01:13:54.040" style="s2">that machinery so we enter into a more</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.060" end="01:13:55.030" style="s2">direct therapeutic relations right</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.040" end="01:13:57.790" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.030" end="01:14:00.310" style="s2">like so I&#39;m on the fence I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.790" end="01:14:02.470" style="s2">suspect just because of well with ideas</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.310" end="01:14:03.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about around consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.470" end="01:14:05.890" style="s2">and the structure of the brain and how</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.970" end="01:14:09.490" style="s2">those things are related I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.890" end="01:14:10.930" style="s2">reason why the brain not only shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.490" end="01:14:13.030" style="s2">be able to but almost certainly</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.930" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">undoubtedly is supporting multiple</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.030" end="01:14:16.570" style="s2">consciousness is evidence from lucid</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:18.160" style="s2">dreaming and yeah there&#39;s evidence from</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.570" end="01:14:20.050" style="s2">lucid dreaming I mean it goes right back</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.160" end="01:14:21.340" style="s2">to split brain we&#39;ve sort of known this</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.050" end="01:14:23.050" style="s2">for a long time but we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.340" end="01:14:25.360" style="s2">support them more than one yeah and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.050" end="01:14:27.190" style="s2">know unless you think that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:29.080" style="s2">magic number of brain cells that kicks</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.190" end="01:14:30.130" style="s2">off consciousness it&#39;s like I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.080" end="01:14:31.630" style="s2">any reason why certain</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.130" end="01:14:33.010" style="s2">of structures and functional patterns</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.630" end="01:14:34.780" style="s2">can&#39;t have separate operating</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.010" end="01:14:37.690" style="s2">consciousnesses and when you look at</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.780" end="01:14:39.220" style="s2">structural dissociation as a field it</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.690" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">just becomes increasingly obvious like</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.220" end="01:14:45.130" style="s2">this is happening right and res lab</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:47.170" style="s2">right hypnosis dissociation we can get</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.130" end="01:14:50.170" style="s2">into that but the point is I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.170" end="01:14:52.180" style="s2">per se whether or not there are already</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.170" end="01:14:54.970" style="s2">multiple people running around your head</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.180" end="01:14:57.070" style="s2">or there are multiple dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.970" end="01:14:58.930" style="s2">forces and the best way for you to deal</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.070" end="01:15:00.640" style="s2">with them is to interact with them and</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.930" end="01:15:02.710" style="s2">turn them into people the spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.640" end="01:15:05.350" style="s2">finesse yes spirit of finesse but also</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.710" end="01:15:07.030" style="s2">like the kind of projective love that</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.350" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">you use with children and the projective</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.030" end="01:15:12.250" style="s2">love God uses to turn us into people</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:13.900" style="s2">agape I like that kind of connection I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.250" end="01:15:15.370" style="s2">sort of seeing yeah so I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.900" end="01:15:16.900" style="s2">to bring it one more time around to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.370" end="01:15:19.060" style="s2">connection I keep interrupting you too</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.900" end="01:15:21.370" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a connection between young</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.060" end="01:15:23.380" style="s2">and the way you are connecting young and</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.370" end="01:15:25.390" style="s2">relevance realization like you just did</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.380" end="01:15:27.340" style="s2">it again yeah yeah well you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.390" end="01:15:29.290" style="s2">circumambulating yeah that&#39;s a bore of</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.340" end="01:15:33.310" style="s2">the term yes oh by the way it comes</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.290" end="01:15:35.050" style="s2">originally from Plato right so so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.310" end="01:15:38.620" style="s2">know there&#39;s this variety of encounters</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.050" end="01:15:39.700" style="s2">but like I said I think that you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.620" end="01:15:42.130" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about the divine</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.700" end="01:15:44.260" style="s2">double for instance okay that is an</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.130" end="01:15:45.610" style="s2">aspect of encounter that you would have</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.260" end="01:15:48.460" style="s2">with yourself with the shadow with</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.610" end="01:15:50.920" style="s2">mercurius with whatever but then I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.460" end="01:15:55.740" style="s2">that there is a level below or beyond</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.920" end="01:15:55.740" style="s2">that which is a kind of direct</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.970" end="01:16:03.600" style="s2">transgenic &#39;el identity relationship</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.590" end="01:16:06.670" style="s2">with the machinery of your own cognition</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.600" end="01:16:08.830" style="s2">right so the pre ago ik pre-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.670" end="01:16:10.450" style="s2">relevance realizes relevance right and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.830" end="01:16:12.520" style="s2">maybe something beyond that - I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.450" end="01:16:13.960" style="s2">know yeah I like I&#39;m not totally sure</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.520" end="01:16:16.000" style="s2">how deep that can go but at the very</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.960" end="01:16:17.830" style="s2">least relevance realization and I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.000" end="01:16:19.090" style="s2">that&#39;s actually probably it the best to</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.830" end="01:16:21.760" style="s2">take that I have on what it is to</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.090" end="01:16:24.340" style="s2">encounter the cell mmm the self isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.760" end="01:16:26.380" style="s2">any of these individual features it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.340" end="01:16:28.030" style="s2">the thing that allows these individual</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.380" end="01:16:29.740" style="s2">features to come into existence and</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.030" end="01:16:31.570" style="s2">supports them to begin one right right I</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.740" end="01:16:34.300" style="s2">see that that&#39;s that&#39;s what very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.570" end="01:16:35.890" style="s2">put and God wears many masks you you</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.300" end="01:16:37.390" style="s2">know so to directly encounter it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.890" end="01:16:39.130" style="s2">nearly impossible you encounter it</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.390" end="01:16:41.140" style="s2">through its manifestations it&#39;s a shape</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.130" end="01:16:42.780" style="s2">changer the closer you get to it the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.140" end="01:16:45.410" style="s2">more obvious that becomes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.780" end="01:16:47.670" style="s2">Mercurius is intrinsically sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.410" end="01:16:49.950" style="s2">paradoxical and shape-changing and a</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.670" end="01:16:52.350" style="s2">trickster and is the son of God in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.950" end="01:16:53.540" style="s2">devil as they say and has all these</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.350" end="01:16:56.790" style="s2">other things right it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.540" end="01:17:01.020" style="s2">approaches non-duality zhe&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.790" end="01:17:03.000" style="s2">that is beyond duality right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.020" end="01:17:05.340" style="s2">sort of hovers on the very threshold of</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.000" end="01:17:07.860" style="s2">entering into that Yunis mundus state</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.340" end="01:17:10.110" style="s2">which is the you know that the the ERG</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.860" end="01:17:12.390" style="s2">runned the thing that makes it all right</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.110" end="01:17:16.020" style="s2">and in the sent the center of our own</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.390" end="01:17:17.550" style="s2">being as as the beings that we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.020" end="01:17:20.790" style="s2">attempting to figure out and you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.550" end="01:17:23.100" style="s2">how to carry on sense right that I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.790" end="01:17:25.260" style="s2">is probably the best that&#39;s my best shot</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.100" end="01:17:27.930" style="s2">anyway no that&#39;s that&#39;s very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.260" end="01:17:29.490" style="s2">that&#39;s very clear so as you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.930" end="01:17:32.370" style="s2">tried to use the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.490" end="01:17:33.930" style="s2">machinery and I guess at times a</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.370" end="01:17:36.840" style="s2">complicated way but at least a complex</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.930" end="01:17:40.800" style="s2">way of trying to get a grip on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.840" end="01:17:42.420" style="s2">meaning crisis yeah well funny actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.800" end="01:17:44.100" style="s2">I was thinking about this in the way in</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.420" end="01:17:46.890" style="s2">and I was thinking about the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.100" end="01:17:49.710" style="s2">crisis relative to young and the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.890" end="01:17:51.930" style="s2">that spiritual crisis in young is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.710" end="01:17:53.460" style="s2">entry point and I thought oh if I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.930" end="01:17:55.320" style="s2">borrow the meaning crisis and blow</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.460" end="01:17:56.880" style="s2">something from The Simpsons in the Union</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.320" end="01:18:01.890" style="s2">sense we&#39;re actually facing the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.880" end="01:18:03.540" style="s2">Christ eternity it&#39;s the meaning Christ</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.890" end="01:18:05.880" style="s2">eternity yes everything is falling apart</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.540" end="01:18:08.250" style="s2">and terrible and on fire and this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.880" end="01:18:11.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the door right that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.250" end="01:18:15.720" style="s2">so the reason I brought that up is</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.420" end="01:18:18.330" style="s2">because I think Young is a prophet of</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.720" end="01:18:23.220" style="s2">the mean crisis and we talked about you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.330" end="01:18:25.500" style="s2">know part of what part of how I see him</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.220" end="01:18:27.450" style="s2">a prophet is precisely his critique of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.500" end="01:18:29.550" style="s2">the the established religion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.450" end="01:18:31.200" style="s2">doing a good enough job and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.550" end="01:18:33.300" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s I think a fair</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.200" end="01:18:35.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a pervasive theme that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.300" end="01:18:37.320" style="s2">young I think and that then lines up</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.340" end="01:18:39.030" style="s2">with like I said his relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.320" end="01:18:43.170" style="s2">religion and Christianity particulars a</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.030" end="01:18:44.670" style="s2">much more distanced relationship so why</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.170" end="01:18:46.410" style="s2">I&#39;m bringing that up is that that brings</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.670" end="01:18:48.150" style="s2">us up to the topic of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.410" end="01:18:51.510" style="s2">young and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.150" end="01:18:54.090" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and his take on that</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.510" end="01:18:57.200" style="s2">and the reading of the Bible that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.090" end="01:19:02.100" style="s2">done and like so it&#39;s clear to me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.200" end="01:19:03.150" style="s2">that Jordan has said many insightful</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.100" end="01:19:05.130" style="s2">things I don&#39;t want to detract from that</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.150" end="01:19:06.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s clear to me that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.130" end="01:19:08.430" style="s2">things he&#39;s doing and and in this sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.960" end="01:19:10.590" style="s2">he echoes Joseph Campbell Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.430" end="01:19:12.090" style="s2">Campbell sort of was a big star for a</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.590" end="01:19:14.520" style="s2">while when I was growing up trim right</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.090" end="01:19:16.080" style="s2">but he has the influence over of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.520" end="01:19:18.540" style="s2">original stars we watched him with bill</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.080" end="01:19:21.270" style="s2">moyers on it&#39;s on Netflix the power of</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.540" end="01:19:23.489" style="s2">myth and not in the huge influence on</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.270" end="01:19:27.000" style="s2">the the original for the original three</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.489" end="01:19:29.040" style="s2">movies yes star wars and because exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.000" end="01:19:32.520" style="s2">that he brings up young as a way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.040" end="01:19:33.900" style="s2">giving people access to symbolism and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.520" end="01:19:36.330" style="s2">self transcendence and self</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.900" end="01:19:38.760" style="s2">transformation in response to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.330" end="01:19:40.830" style="s2">meeting crisis and I see part of why</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.760" end="01:19:42.150" style="s2">Jordan skyrocketed part of it of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.830" end="01:19:44.580" style="s2">was a whole political thing that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.150" end="01:19:46.050" style="s2">want to get into but part of it is he</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.580" end="01:19:48.630" style="s2">does something similar to Campbell but</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.050" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">he does it I&#39;m much more charismatic Lee</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.630" end="01:19:52.800" style="s2">yeah I think and he also has he has so</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:55.080" style="s2">much more powerful medium at his</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.800" end="01:19:59.700" style="s2">disposal which is social media YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.080" end="01:20:02.010" style="s2">acceptor and so in and and this is not</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.700" end="01:20:04.110" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna engage in any left-handed</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.010" end="01:20:05.700" style="s2">criticisms of Jordan does not be</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.110" end="01:20:10.680" style="s2">dismissive but I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.700" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">the power of of his why he he was taken</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.680" end="01:20:15.300" style="s2">up by so many people is precisely the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:16.590" style="s2">power that that is in young yet has a</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.300" end="01:20:20.280" style="s2">response to the meeting crisis yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.590" end="01:20:26.910" style="s2">Jordan Jordan has his hand in contact</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.280" end="01:20:28.440" style="s2">with a current of mythic right and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.910" end="01:20:30.360" style="s2">know the yeah that&#39;s powerful stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.440" end="01:20:31.500" style="s2">it can talk about that by way of Star</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.360" end="01:20:34.260" style="s2">Wars because I think actually that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.500" end="01:20:35.790" style="s2">really interesting for example you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.260" end="01:20:38.160" style="s2">as far as the meaning crisis goes yet</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.790" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">young you know young wrote a really</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.160" end="01:20:42.150" style="s2">interesting essay during the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:44.910" style="s2">Nazism or immediately before called</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.150" end="01:20:46.590" style="s2">Wotan which I think is not as widely</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.910" end="01:20:48.989" style="s2">read as it should be where he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.590" end="01:20:50.580" style="s2">about sort of this this rise of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.989" end="01:20:52.380" style="s2">particular figure within the Germanic</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.580" end="01:20:54.180" style="s2">psyche and what this is going to mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.380" end="01:20:56.760" style="s2">and but at the same time he spends lots</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.180" end="01:20:58.140" style="s2">of time talking about how modernity is</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.760" end="01:21:00.450" style="s2">breaking down these old structures he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.140" end="01:21:02.550" style="s2">a student of nature it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.450" end="01:21:04.110" style="s2">unaware that God is dead and we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.550" end="01:21:05.020" style="s2">killed him and how can we get the blood</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.110" end="01:21:07.270" style="s2">off our hands on what</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.020" end="01:21:10.090" style="s2">we need to become to justify our crime</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.270" end="01:21:12.520" style="s2">he knows all that and in fact in ion</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.090" end="01:21:14.890" style="s2">which is perhaps his most profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.520" end="01:21:17.560" style="s2">weird book and I say that you know like</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.890" end="01:21:20.860" style="s2">pointedly uh you know ion is the second</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.560" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">part of collected works volume 9 the</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.860" end="01:21:24.640" style="s2">first part is it&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:27.460" style="s2">straightforward and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.640" end="01:21:29.650" style="s2">sort of different archetypal structures</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.460" end="01:21:31.420" style="s2">and complexes but the second part ion is</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.650" end="01:21:33.310" style="s2">this really interesting wide-ranging</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.420" end="01:21:34.900" style="s2">book that&#39;s hard and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.310" end="01:21:36.520" style="s2">that he says an ion he gets into this</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.900" end="01:21:38.890" style="s2">like you know cycles of history thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.520" end="01:21:40.780" style="s2">and he says you know the faintest</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.890" end="01:21:42.670" style="s2">rudiments were on 2,000 year cyclists so</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.780" end="01:21:44.890" style="s2">the famous or thereabouts so the</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.670" end="01:21:47.680" style="s2">faintest rudiments of the future society</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.890" end="01:21:49.150" style="s2">are actually visible now he said and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.680" end="01:21:50.620" style="s2">think that will transition to that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.150" end="01:21:51.190" style="s2">Society in about five or six hundred</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.620" end="01:21:54.900" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.190" end="01:21:57.760" style="s2">I remember reading that and thinking oh</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.900" end="01:22:00.250" style="s2">right like this isn&#39;t Age of Aquarius</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.760" end="01:22:02.470" style="s2">around the corner no this isn&#39;t I live</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.250" end="01:22:04.330" style="s2">to see it probably this is like right</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.470" end="01:22:06.520" style="s2">we&#39;re in the middle of a broad cultural</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.330" end="01:22:07.900" style="s2">movement in the in change and</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.520" end="01:22:09.790" style="s2">understanding in our relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.900" end="01:22:12.120" style="s2">world and really the scale that we need</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.790" end="01:22:15.070" style="s2">to look at is century&#39;s technological</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.120" end="01:22:16.570" style="s2">acceleration notwithstanding I found</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.070" end="01:22:17.980" style="s2">that a really striking passage and that</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.570" end="01:22:21.010" style="s2">sort of Young&#39;s take that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.980" end="01:22:23.500" style="s2">go through this age of fire and despair</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.010" end="01:22:25.390" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to lose touch with lots</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.500" end="01:22:29.580" style="s2">of the formative myths but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.390" end="01:22:31.900" style="s2">necessarily bad either right so so</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.580" end="01:22:34.810" style="s2">breaking away from certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.900" end="01:22:36.670" style="s2">myths right myths have a currency at a</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.560" end="01:22:46.930" style="s2">thing that&#39;s fitted to human behavior</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.970" end="01:22:48.490" style="s2">later and to some extent right we you</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.930" end="01:22:50.350" style="s2">know we still see the rudiments of that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.490" end="01:22:51.880" style="s2">like when we talk about Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.350" end="01:22:53.590" style="s2">and we talk about the hero&#39;s journey I</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.880" end="01:22:55.990" style="s2">have to admit I&#39;m deeply ambivalent</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.590" end="01:22:58.270" style="s2">about the hero&#39;s and so he&#39;s always yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.990" end="01:23:00.700" style="s2">well I mean you know so Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.270" end="01:23:02.620" style="s2">I think does you know he has the problem</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.700" end="01:23:04.720" style="s2">that lots of structuralist have right</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.620" end="01:23:06.640" style="s2">that he&#39;s not really paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.720" end="01:23:08.800" style="s2">the cultural specificity like that he</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.640" end="01:23:10.360" style="s2">tends to over synthesize but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.800" end="01:23:12.760" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about it to me and</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.360" end="01:23:14.830" style="s2">and this you&#39;ll see I think where this</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.760" end="01:23:16.900" style="s2">connects to the way that Jordan I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.830" end="01:23:18.820" style="s2">connects to some of this stuff too so</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.900" end="01:23:21.820" style="s2">Joseph Campbell does this thing he</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.820" end="01:23:24.430" style="s2">Chris the monomyth yeah the one guiding</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.820" end="01:23:26.680" style="s2">you no myth that you can you know use</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.430" end="01:23:30.100" style="s2">this the skeleton key to understand all</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.680" end="01:23:32.650" style="s2">of this stuff okay fine so George Lucas</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.100" end="01:23:34.660" style="s2">goes and reads the monomyth and he</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.650" end="01:23:37.000" style="s2">expressly takes it and it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.660" end="01:23:38.860" style="s2">gonna make a movie that&#39;s this combined</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.000" end="01:23:41.560" style="s2">with Flash Gordon right and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.860" end="01:23:43.450" style="s2">he does right so you know before that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.560" end="01:23:45.160" style="s2">George Lucas you&#39;re gonna get a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.450" end="01:23:47.620" style="s2">rant here before that George Lucas had</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.160" end="01:23:49.660" style="s2">made like you know thx 1-1 3-8 and</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.620" end="01:23:51.190" style="s2">American Graffiti right and American</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.660" end="01:23:53.290" style="s2">Graffiti made enough money that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.190" end="01:23:55.330" style="s2">studio said George we&#39;re gonna give you</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.290" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">fifteen million bucks go make what you</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.330" end="01:24:00.340" style="s2">want and he was like terrific I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:02.020" style="s2">make this movie about skinny robots and</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.340" end="01:24:03.940" style="s2">hairy giants and space wind sprints and</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.020" end="01:24:06.460" style="s2">everybody looked at it and said or</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.940" end="01:24:07.000" style="s2">whatever right and the cast thought it</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.460" end="01:24:09.520" style="s2">was garbage</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.000" end="01:24:12.280" style="s2">and everybody thought it was ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.520" end="01:24:14.290" style="s2">but he explicitly took the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.280" end="01:24:16.480" style="s2">incoherent massive notes that he had</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.290" end="01:24:17.980" style="s2">instruction it according to Campbell and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.480" end="01:24:21.700" style="s2">what do we get coming out of the far</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.980" end="01:24:23.830" style="s2">side we get the blockbuster and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.700" end="01:24:25.570" style="s2">blockbuster is like that&#39;s a very modern</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.830" end="01:24:26.860" style="s2">phenomenon in a certain kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.570" end="01:24:28.420" style="s2">right the idea that people would go to a</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.860" end="01:24:30.610" style="s2">movie theater and see something 12 times</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.420" end="01:24:32.230" style="s2">that they would merchandise at that</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.610" end="01:24:34.420" style="s2">level and scale the bedsheets the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.230" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">lunchboxes and I&#39;m old enough that I</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.420" end="01:24:39.460" style="s2">remember the first wave of of Star Wars</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:40.780" style="s2">here through right since then Disney has</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.460" end="01:24:43.390" style="s2">learned to operate the pump full-time</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.780" end="01:24:46.270" style="s2">but that first time through like it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.390" end="01:24:48.640" style="s2">a phenomenon and to say that it you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.270" end="01:24:49.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a structuring myth for people in my</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.640" end="01:24:52.120" style="s2">generation I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.900" end="01:24:54.310" style="s2">exaggeration sure more people on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.120" end="01:24:57.010" style="s2">British census identify themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.310" end="01:24:58.390" style="s2">Jedi than Jewish yeah christen Philip</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.010" end="01:25:01.180" style="s2">and I talked about that in the zombies</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.390" end="01:25:03.610" style="s2">Yeah right okay so he&#39;s doing something</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.180" end="01:25:05.110" style="s2">really specific when he taps into the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.610" end="01:25:07.090" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey and its enormous Lee</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.110" end="01:25:08.830" style="s2">resonant for people you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.090" end="01:25:10.570" style="s2">sense that the older myths are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.830" end="01:25:12.580" style="s2">played out right people don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.570" end="01:25:14.560" style="s2">same kind of connection from them but</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.580" end="01:25:18.520" style="s2">you take the same stuff and and reclose</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.560" end="01:25:21.430" style="s2">it however since then Hollywood has done</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.520" end="01:25:23.290" style="s2">what Western culture does right the</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.430" end="01:25:24.970" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey as applied to Hollywood</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.290" end="01:25:27.250" style="s2">blockbusters is the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.970" end="01:25:29.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with fast food and cocaine we</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.250" end="01:25:32.230" style="s2">take something that in it sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.160" end="01:25:32.579" style="s2">occasional a non concentrated state is</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.230" end="01:25:35.309" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.579" end="01:25:37.530" style="s2">for us and useful and instead turned it</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.309" end="01:25:40.469" style="s2">into something that&#39;s delightful to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.530" end="01:25:43.139" style="s2">degree of being poisonous we mainline</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.469" end="01:25:44.999" style="s2">this same myth over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.139" end="01:25:47.999" style="s2">and over again and the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.999" end="01:25:50.489" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey in my opinion okay he</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.999" end="01:25:53.249" style="s2">said it&#39;s just one myth it isn&#39;t to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.489" end="01:25:55.739" style="s2">monomyth right it isn&#39;t the soul mythic</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.249" end="01:25:57.030" style="s2">human beings tell or that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.739" end="01:25:59.519" style="s2">structuring your life the sole thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.030" end="01:26:01.379" style="s2">isn&#39;t about a descent and a struggle</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.519" end="01:26:03.329" style="s2">against the great dragon that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.379" end="01:26:05.550" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s going on and we know</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.329" end="01:26:07.199" style="s2">that even from young because young in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.550" end="01:26:09.479" style="s2">pivotal time after his break both Freud</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.199" end="01:26:11.669" style="s2">has this dream where he kills Siegfried</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.479" end="01:26:14.070" style="s2">right Siegfried the solar Hillary kills</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.669" end="01:26:16.079" style="s2">him and he feels tremendous shame but</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.070" end="01:26:18.929" style="s2">what he interprets that dream for</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.079" end="01:26:21.269" style="s2">himself right he&#39;s like oh right that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.929" end="01:26:23.639" style="s2">part of my life the solar hero part</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.269" end="01:26:25.589" style="s2">where I am questing to fight dragons has</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.639" end="01:26:27.659" style="s2">to come to an end if I am going to</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.589" end="01:26:29.579" style="s2">develop wisdom right wisdom is not a</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.659" end="01:26:31.800" style="s2">high energy state where you slay dragons</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.579" end="01:26:32.459" style="s2">right right right right right right</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.800" end="01:26:35.459" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.459" end="01:26:39.089" style="s2">right and so we we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.459" end="01:26:40.079" style="s2">selectively chosen to pull some of this</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.089" end="01:26:41.699" style="s2">stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.079" end="01:26:43.499" style="s2">that&#39;s a commodification and a</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.699" end="01:26:45.899" style="s2">trivialization and all the way yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.499" end="01:26:47.309" style="s2">also like a concentration we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.899" end="01:26:48.329" style="s2">these men as a good sense of the word</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.309" end="01:26:50.429" style="s2">not in a good sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.329" end="01:26:51.839" style="s2">no like a concentration like like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.429" end="01:26:53.489" style="s2">using cocaine advisedly</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.839" end="01:26:55.019" style="s2">you know you chew a few leaves of</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.489" end="01:26:56.879" style="s2">cocaine it helps you with your altitude</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.019" end="01:26:58.619" style="s2">sickness and it lets you March a little</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.879" end="01:27:00.269" style="s2">longer and it&#39;s generally Pleasant you</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.619" end="01:27:03.539" style="s2">take that and concentrate it to 50 or a</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.269" end="01:27:06.599" style="s2">hundred times and it becomes addictive</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.539" end="01:27:08.249" style="s2">compulsive or a numbing like all these</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.599" end="01:27:10.050" style="s2">things that maybe are not so good so</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.249" end="01:27:12.419" style="s2">this is actually you this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.050" end="01:27:14.939" style="s2">maladaptive appropriation of young then</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.419" end="01:27:17.519" style="s2">in some ways in some ways I think you</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.939" end="01:27:18.869" style="s2">know and I I don&#39;t think I mean and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.519" end="01:27:20.879" style="s2">want to get too much into corporate</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.869" end="01:27:22.589" style="s2">criticism here but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.879" end="01:27:24.619" style="s2">coincidental Disney knows what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.589" end="01:27:28.169" style="s2">doing this is the having mode again oh</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.619" end="01:27:31.439" style="s2">sure and look Disney has been you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.169" end="01:27:33.570" style="s2">like buying up my childhood wholesale</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.439" end="01:27:34.739" style="s2">they they own at all and they know what</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.570" end="01:27:36.419" style="s2">they&#39;re doing Disney knows what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.739" end="01:27:38.010" style="s2">doing they understand this stuff they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.419" end="01:27:40.219" style="s2">understood it for a long time right they</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.010" end="01:27:42.809" style="s2">they understand how to make a meth tech</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.219" end="01:27:45.479" style="s2">alright in this way but of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.809" end="01:27:46.290" style="s2">not in the service to you know at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.479" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2">end of the day maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.290" end="01:27:50.040" style="s2">we can look back fondly on Snow White in</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.000" end="01:27:51.690" style="s2">the Seven Dwarves and say wow what a</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.040" end="01:27:53.100" style="s2">wonderful cultural document that really</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.690" end="01:27:54.510" style="s2">showed us da da da da da but does</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.100" end="01:27:57.450" style="s2">anybody ultimately really believe that</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.510" end="01:27:59.940" style="s2">about frozen - is frozen - being put out</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.450" end="01:28:01.980" style="s2">like help us appropriate our own self</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.940" end="01:28:03.870" style="s2">development certainly you&#39;ve got a nice</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.980" end="01:28:06.900" style="s2">space here so how does this no come back</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.870" end="01:28:10.970" style="s2">to see that&#39;s a excellent critique of</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.900" end="01:28:13.410" style="s2">Campbell Campbell in some ways like he</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.970" end="01:28:15.900" style="s2">he&#39;s great in some ways he&#39;s great in</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.410" end="01:28:17.010" style="s2">some ways but but nobody&#39;s denying them</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.900" end="01:28:19.590" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re making it I think a very</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.010" end="01:28:22.740" style="s2">strong but I think well argued criticism</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.590" end="01:28:25.380" style="s2">that he&#39;s mouth shaping young in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.740" end="01:28:28.080" style="s2">really you know a really important way</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.380" end="01:28:30.870" style="s2">yes is that are you saying the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.080" end="01:28:34.860" style="s2">thing about Jordan so some extent yes I</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.870" end="01:28:36.720" style="s2">mean you know so I have known and worked</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.860" end="01:28:38.520" style="s2">which were nearly as long as I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.720" end="01:28:40.770" style="s2">worked with you yes early contributor</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.520" end="01:28:42.330" style="s2">from mine matters you know he and I had</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.770" end="01:28:43.260" style="s2">looked at doing some projects we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.330" end="01:28:45.150" style="s2">eaten meals together were on a</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.260" end="01:28:48.480" style="s2">first-name basis yeah I&#39;ve seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.150" end="01:28:50.280" style="s2">his talks I know Jordan pretty well but</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.480" end="01:28:53.370" style="s2">his particular take on certain aspects</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.280" end="01:28:55.800" style="s2">of Jung is puzzling to me like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.370" end="01:28:57.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not totally sure how to square it so</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.800" end="01:28:58.590" style="s2">there are some aspects of Jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.120" end="01:29:00.840" style="s2">interpretation of Jung that I think are</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.590" end="01:29:05.550" style="s2">terrific and straightforward right so</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.840" end="01:29:07.530" style="s2">his emphasis on the importance and to</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.550" end="01:29:09.990" style="s2">some extent the reality if not the</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.530" end="01:29:13.680" style="s2">actuality of the mythic level of reality</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.990" end="01:29:16.020" style="s2">is it&#39;s really central and crucial right</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.680" end="01:29:18.000" style="s2">in that sense Jordan nails it right he</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.020" end="01:29:20.340" style="s2">gets it it&#39;s like if you aren&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.000" end="01:29:22.590" style="s2">attention to this level of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.340" end="01:29:24.690" style="s2">you&#39;re missing something really really</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.590" end="01:29:25.980" style="s2">important and the fact that you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.690" end="01:29:27.060" style="s2">that people want to point at it when</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.980" end="01:29:29.370" style="s2">they&#39;re being sort of brass tacks</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.060" end="01:29:30.900" style="s2">realists and saying like but what are we</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.370" end="01:29:32.820" style="s2">really talking about here it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.900" end="01:29:35.610" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t matter like you have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.820" end="01:29:36.990" style="s2">interact with this you know you have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.610" end="01:29:38.760" style="s2">interact with it for the same reason</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.990" end="01:29:39.090" style="s2">that you know like an emotion can start</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.760" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">a war</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.090" end="01:29:45.600" style="s2">but what our emotions really real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:48.150" style="s2">like yes if they are they&#39;re real right</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.600" end="01:29:49.920" style="s2">and these patterns are real I mean to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.150" end="01:29:52.110" style="s2">give you just a quick example before I</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.920" end="01:29:55.350" style="s2">go on this right it&#39;s like at some level</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.110" end="01:29:57.720" style="s2">is the you know is the archetype of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.350" end="01:29:59.580" style="s2">mother right as part of the collective</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.720" end="01:30:02.070" style="s2">unconscious is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.580" end="01:30:03.420" style="s2">a fundamental feature of reality well I</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.070" end="01:30:05.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know but it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.420" end="01:30:08.010" style="s2">feature of every human psyche because</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.760" end="01:30:10.920" style="s2">absolutely every human being had a</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.010" end="01:30:12.660" style="s2">mother yeah and we all have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.920" end="01:30:14.100" style="s2">relationship two of them even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.660" end="01:30:17.310" style="s2">relationship of rejection</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.100" end="01:30:19.050" style="s2">or absence or right and you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.310" end="01:30:21.180" style="s2">talked about with like ducks Gosling&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.050" end="01:30:22.920" style="s2">right you know when they do imprinting</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.180" end="01:30:25.830" style="s2">with Gosling&#39;s Gosling hatches out of</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.920" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">the egg and whatever is there at that</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.830" end="01:30:29.580" style="s2">moment pretty much the Gosling will</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:31.200" style="s2">imprint on and be disposed towards as</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.580" end="01:30:32.460" style="s2">though was a mother so if it&#39;s a mother</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.200" end="01:30:35.520" style="s2">goose</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.460" end="01:30:37.290" style="s2">I said ducks if it&#39;s a mother goose in</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.520" end="01:30:40.350" style="s2">the Gosling hatches that&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.290" end="01:30:42.330" style="s2">nature expects in most conditions but</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.350" end="01:30:44.640" style="s2">you could have a hand puppet or in some</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.330" end="01:30:46.050" style="s2">cases a ping-pong ball and the Gosling</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.640" end="01:30:47.700" style="s2">will imprint on the ping-pong ball in</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.050" end="01:30:50.220" style="s2">precisely the same way the Gosling&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.700" end="01:30:53.010" style="s2">a mother shaped hole or a goose shaped</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.220" end="01:30:54.780" style="s2">hole right in its mind ready to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.010" end="01:30:56.490" style="s2">filled by whatever appears in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.780" end="01:30:58.020" style="s2">of imprinting and then it will you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.490" end="01:31:00.360" style="s2">you roll the ball and the cousins will</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.020" end="01:31:06.090" style="s2">waddle afterwards similarly we all have</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.360" end="01:31:08.780" style="s2">that structure right okay so we have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.090" end="01:31:11.040" style="s2">deal with these mythic realities right</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.780" end="01:31:13.140" style="s2">that I think Jordan does really a</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.040" end="01:31:15.540" style="s2">believe but there are other aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.140" end="01:31:20.340" style="s2">Jung where his interpretation strikes me</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.540" end="01:31:23.190" style="s2">as puzzling so for instance when he</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.340" end="01:31:24.480" style="s2">talks about the shadow right you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.190" end="01:31:27.450" style="s2">Jordan talks about the shadow quite a</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.480" end="01:31:29.370" style="s2">bit and more often than not he talks</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.450" end="01:31:31.620" style="s2">about the shadow sort of in its deep</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.370" end="01:31:34.380" style="s2">collective sense and he references a</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.620" end="01:31:36.900" style="s2">kind of note that that Jung made which</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.380" end="01:31:38.430" style="s2">is like to really encounter the depths</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.900" end="01:31:41.250" style="s2">of the collective shadow is a soul</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.430" end="01:31:42.900" style="s2">blasting experience right so when we</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.250" end="01:31:45.360" style="s2">talk about the shadow the shadow is sort</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.900" end="01:31:47.970" style="s2">of everything that the ego rejects with</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.360" end="01:31:49.920" style="s2">all the potentials within oneself that</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.970" end="01:31:52.620" style="s2">we reject that we throw away they become</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.920" end="01:31:54.120" style="s2">other so technically the shadow could be</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.620" end="01:31:56.070" style="s2">filled with lots of virtues if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.120" end="01:31:57.960" style="s2">particularly vicious person yes and in</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.070" end="01:32:00.570" style="s2">fact it&#39;s typically filled with virtues</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.960" end="01:32:02.760" style="s2">regardless right so Jung often talks</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.570" end="01:32:04.200" style="s2">about the golden shadow the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.760" end="01:32:05.430" style="s2">when you were doing shadow work in which</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.200" end="01:32:07.110" style="s2">I mentioned is the apprentice piece</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.430" end="01:32:09.300" style="s2">right a lot of what you&#39;re doing is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.110" end="01:32:11.969" style="s2">partly that&#39;s about gaming a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.300" end="01:32:13.920" style="s2">of the ways in which you have been</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.969" end="01:32:15.960" style="s2">a bad person yeah but bad things that</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.920" end="01:32:17.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that you I you know people</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.960" end="01:32:19.440" style="s2">that you&#39;ve hurt bad things you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.640" end="01:32:21.989" style="s2">you kind of known it but a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.440" end="01:32:23.489" style="s2">about just you know going back and</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.989" end="01:32:26.460" style="s2">accessing the things that you left</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.489" end="01:32:28.230" style="s2">behind right you made decisions you make</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.460" end="01:32:30.090" style="s2">decisions about who you were going to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.230" end="01:32:31.949" style="s2">and sometimes you made those decisions</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.090" end="01:32:33.570" style="s2">because like you know your parents told</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.949" end="01:32:33.930" style="s2">you to do one thing rather than the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.570" end="01:32:36.030" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.930" end="01:32:38.010" style="s2">sometimes you did it to differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.030" end="01:32:39.630" style="s2">yourself from a sibling or a friend</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.010" end="01:32:41.760" style="s2">right I&#39;m this kind of person not that</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.630" end="01:32:43.260" style="s2">kind of person it might just be might</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.760" end="01:32:45.060" style="s2">just be underdeveloped aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.260" end="01:32:47.610" style="s2">yourself then that&#39;s exactly what it it</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.060" end="01:32:49.949" style="s2">is so so when we talk about shadow work</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.610" end="01:32:51.150" style="s2">the golden shadow is pulling up these</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.949" end="01:32:52.890" style="s2">things that you left behind that are</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.150" end="01:32:54.480" style="s2">actually good because when you hit a</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.890" end="01:32:56.219" style="s2">certain stage in life right you might</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.480" end="01:32:58.739" style="s2">stagnate on the formulation that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.219" end="01:33:00.449" style="s2">guys have and so where do you get that</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.739" end="01:33:03.000" style="s2">material well you get it by reaching</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.449" end="01:33:04.590" style="s2">back by reaching into the things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.000" end="01:33:06.570" style="s2">thrown away oh and there&#39;s difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.590" end="01:33:08.850" style="s2">because you&#39;ve set up a structure of</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.570" end="01:33:11.070" style="s2">rejecting those things right right and</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.850" end="01:33:13.230" style="s2">not just that but like typically</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.070" end="01:33:15.690" style="s2">speaking to you know if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.230" end="01:33:17.130" style="s2">some kind of conscious relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.690" end="01:33:19.530" style="s2">this part of yourself and most people</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.130" end="01:33:20.910" style="s2">don&#39;t off the bat we reject it you tend</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.530" end="01:33:23.190" style="s2">to take that material and project it</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.910" end="01:33:24.719" style="s2">outside of yourself I said so you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.190" end="01:33:27.330" style="s2">we&#39;re all familiar with the term like</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.719" end="01:33:29.550" style="s2">love at first sight right ah but hate at</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.330" end="01:33:31.170" style="s2">first sight yeah is the thing - right</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.550" end="01:33:33.930" style="s2">the thing that makes love at first sight</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.170" end="01:33:36.719" style="s2">operate is like we have an outsize</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.930" end="01:33:37.949" style="s2">reaction a disproportionate degree of oh</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.719" end="01:33:39.690" style="s2">my god I feel like I&#39;ve known them</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.949" end="01:33:41.160" style="s2">forever we wandered around it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.690" end="01:33:42.750" style="s2">we&#39;re soul mates that&#39;s all love at</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.160" end="01:33:44.520" style="s2">first sight right right this feeling</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.750" end="01:33:46.380" style="s2">that there is some depth there that</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.520" end="01:33:48.600" style="s2">can&#39;t be there because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.380" end="01:33:51.180" style="s2">them as people but hate at first sight</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.600" end="01:33:52.530" style="s2">operates - and it&#39;s deeply projected in</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.180" end="01:33:55.500" style="s2">the same way right we encounter somebody</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.530" end="01:33:57.420" style="s2">and we just they just drive us crazy</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.500" end="01:33:59.250" style="s2">right we just hate their guts even</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.420" end="01:34:01.710" style="s2">though we don&#39;t know mmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.250" end="01:34:03.380" style="s2">projective shadow material shadow</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.710" end="01:34:06.630" style="s2">material can also show up as like</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.380" end="01:34:10.050" style="s2">incredible fear fear of the other right</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.630" end="01:34:12.630" style="s2">so we reject and push away these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.050" end="01:34:15.270" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of unthinkable it&#39;s so far</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.630" end="01:34:17.730" style="s2">from us that it&#39;s unthinkable right and</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.270" end="01:34:20.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a rigidity to that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.730" end="01:34:23.010" style="s2">if you have that other ring I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.940" end="01:34:25.140" style="s2">get kind of two problems that turn up in</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.010" end="01:34:25.830" style="s2">the in sort of the clinical aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.140" end="01:34:27.690" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.830" end="01:34:30.270" style="s2">is you don&#39;t have access to that wealth</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.690" end="01:34:32.340" style="s2">of possibilities right right so you</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.270" end="01:34:33.960" style="s2">can&#39;t reach back and pull aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.340" end="01:34:36.000" style="s2">yourself you know used to draw as a kid</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.960" end="01:34:38.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I just lost track of that</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.000" end="01:34:41.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very possible that to access sort</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.730" end="01:34:42.690" style="s2">of the green shoots in your psyche for</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.400" end="01:34:44.340" style="s2">your own development and it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.690" end="01:34:45.570" style="s2">to go and pull those things back but why</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.340" end="01:34:47.460" style="s2">did you throw in a way to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.570" end="01:34:49.800" style="s2">you might thrown it away because you got</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.460" end="01:34:51.360" style="s2">chastised you need to grow up you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.800" end="01:34:53.430" style="s2">grow up and stop drawing like you need</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.360" end="01:34:53.960" style="s2">to focus on accounting or whatever right</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.430" end="01:34:56.310" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.960" end="01:34:57.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the problem the other</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.310" end="01:35:00.020" style="s2">part of the problem is the further away</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.810" end="01:35:02.940" style="s2">you push it right the more you</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.020" end="01:35:06.480" style="s2">dissociate yourself from that material</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.940" end="01:35:08.370" style="s2">the more autonomous it becomes and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.480" end="01:35:11.070" style="s2">the tendency is then for it to operate</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.370" end="01:35:12.840" style="s2">sort of on its own it doesn&#39;t go away it</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.070" end="01:35:15.780" style="s2">just does things and you don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.840" end="01:35:17.730" style="s2">and you see this really clearly in</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.780" end="01:35:20.310" style="s2">people that are I mean dissociative</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.730" end="01:35:22.950" style="s2">right yeah where they&#39;ve rejected some</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.310" end="01:35:27.180" style="s2">aspect of themselves and so as an</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.950" end="01:35:29.610" style="s2">example I knew a good friend of mine was</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.180" end="01:35:31.470" style="s2">married to a fellow who was the first</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.610" end="01:35:34.200" style="s2">instance that I ever encountered of what</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.470" end="01:35:36.090" style="s2">I came to call Spock Buddhists so this</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.200" end="01:35:39.600" style="s2">was a guy who who took up the Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.090" end="01:35:42.030" style="s2">and his explicit desire was to banish</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.600" end="01:35:43.320" style="s2">all emotions from himself to become a</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.030" end="01:35:45.930" style="s2">perfectly right and this is one of these</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.320" end="01:35:48.030" style="s2">forms of spiritual bypassing brahman so</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.930" end="01:35:52.580" style="s2">as a SPOC Buddhist this person believed</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.030" end="01:35:56.970" style="s2">that he had no more emotions he believed</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.580" end="01:35:59.250" style="s2">right so you can guess exactly what this</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.970" end="01:36:02.700" style="s2">did what it meant was that he had these</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.250" end="01:36:06.570" style="s2">incredible outbursts of sadness and rage</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.700" end="01:36:09.120" style="s2">right but he could never own them it was</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.570" end="01:36:10.500" style="s2">never him and always you yes this is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.120" end="01:36:12.840" style="s2">rational response to what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.500" end="01:36:15.240" style="s2">they say this isn&#39;t me experiencing an</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.840" end="01:36:17.160" style="s2">emotion this is the rational fitted</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.240" end="01:36:18.540" style="s2">response to what you&#39;re doing this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.160" end="01:36:21.090" style="s2">the problem with distancing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.540" end="01:36:22.530" style="s2">from your shadow okay so doing shadow</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.090" end="01:36:24.810" style="s2">work is the apprentice piece because</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.530" end="01:36:26.430" style="s2">despite all the difficulty of really</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.810" end="01:36:28.980" style="s2">looking taking a hard look in the mirror</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.430" end="01:36:30.900" style="s2">and and acknowledging with sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.980" end="01:36:33.540" style="s2">deep humility and</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.900" end="01:36:36.570" style="s2">you know commitment to truth the ways in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.540" end="01:36:38.490" style="s2">which you are maybe not great right</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.570" end="01:36:40.350" style="s2">which is part of the work it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.490" end="01:36:42.150" style="s2">right there it&#39;s easy to get at compared</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.350" end="01:36:43.620" style="s2">to some of those deep psychic stuff also</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.150" end="01:36:45.930" style="s2">the stuff those are the ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.620" end="01:36:48.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve been sort of an asshole yes right</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.930" end="01:36:51.090" style="s2">are more easily accessible than these</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.540" end="01:36:53.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll the one the the golden shadow is</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.090" end="01:36:54.450" style="s2">that my understanding you to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.010" end="01:36:55.740" style="s2">I mean the thing is that the ways in</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.450" end="01:36:57.240" style="s2">which you&#39;ve been an asshole generally</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.740" end="01:36:59.220" style="s2">you know jump you at 2:00 in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.240" end="01:37:01.320" style="s2">anyway right right the trink trick is</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.220" end="01:37:03.510" style="s2">just not to shrink away right right we</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.320" end="01:37:05.460" style="s2">we often most people will experience</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.510" end="01:37:08.670" style="s2">some moments where we&#39;re like oh like I</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.460" end="01:37:10.080" style="s2">feel profoundly bad about myself and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.670" end="01:37:12.150" style="s2">know there are a few things that we can</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.080" end="01:37:13.890" style="s2">do sometimes what we do is we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.150" end="01:37:15.750" style="s2">slurp the kool-aid of self-esteem and</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.890" end="01:37:18.930" style="s2">say no I&#39;m perfect just as I am and</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.750" end="01:37:20.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not good another thing that we do</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.930" end="01:37:21.420" style="s2">is we externalize that outside of</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.460" end="01:37:23.820" style="s2">ourselves these are the people that</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.420" end="01:37:25.710" style="s2">become proponents of the one true way</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.820" end="01:37:28.080" style="s2">and they&#39;re like I&#39;m never wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.710" end="01:37:30.030" style="s2">always the world everybody&#39;s an idiot</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.080" end="01:37:31.620" style="s2">all right these people who are always</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.030" end="01:37:35.700" style="s2">right about everything and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.620" end="01:37:37.980" style="s2">horrible inflexible place to be so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.700" end="01:37:40.260" style="s2">trying to so what you&#39;re doing is making</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.980" end="01:37:42.990" style="s2">an argument that the shadow is a very</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.260" end="01:37:45.240" style="s2">complex thing yeah and our relationship</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.990" end="01:37:47.790" style="s2">to it is also very complex absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.240" end="01:37:49.470" style="s2">and then you you crafted this argument</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.790" end="01:37:51.780" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s a really good argument</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.470" end="01:37:55.650" style="s2">in response to my question about a</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.780" end="01:37:57.630" style="s2">criticism of Jordan Jordan so so so one</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.650" end="01:37:58.830" style="s2">aspect though of shadow work I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.630" end="01:38:01.320" style="s2">about shadow work and I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.830" end="01:38:02.910" style="s2">in very personal terms right but there</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.320" end="01:38:04.050" style="s2">is an aspect that Jung talks about where</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.910" end="01:38:05.900" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with the shadow and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.050" end="01:38:09.180" style="s2">collective sense and this is like</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.900" end="01:38:10.680" style="s2">encountering some of the fundamental as</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.180" end="01:38:12.720" style="s2">it were darkness that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.680" end="01:38:15.960" style="s2">human experience right for all that we</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.720" end="01:38:18.120" style="s2">are you know spiritual beings concerned</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.960" end="01:38:20.700" style="s2">but the esthetic and love we are also a</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.120" end="01:38:23.550" style="s2">genocide &#39;el species right capable of</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.700" end="01:38:26.310" style="s2">tremendous right producing tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.550" end="01:38:28.710" style="s2">suffering cruelty like this is an aspect</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.310" end="01:38:30.450" style="s2">of human experience - and one that</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.710" end="01:38:32.760" style="s2">really does need to be confronted with</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.450" end="01:38:34.320" style="s2">right it seems to me that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.760" end="01:38:36.720" style="s2">time when Jordan talks about the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.320" end="01:38:39.120" style="s2">he talks about it with a very strong</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.720" end="01:38:41.310" style="s2">emphasis on that collective I see sense</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.120" end="01:38:43.020" style="s2">right that you too could be a Nazi right</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.310" end="01:38:44.310" style="s2">right and that&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.020" end="01:38:46.400" style="s2">important to recognize that you could be</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.310" end="01:38:46.400" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.450" end="01:38:51.110" style="s2">but you don&#39;t want to stay there all the</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.130" end="01:38:52.220" style="s2">time you want to pull your focus back to</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.110" end="01:38:53.780" style="s2">your personal shadow because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.220" end="01:38:57.770" style="s2">where the work is right right right</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.780" end="01:38:59.900" style="s2">right so that&#39;s one thing but for</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.770" end="01:39:02.800" style="s2">instance okay I saw a piece where</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.900" end="01:39:08.000" style="s2">somebody had asked Jordan how one</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.800" end="01:39:10.460" style="s2">develops their shadow right and leaving</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.000" end="01:39:11.900" style="s2">aside that really properly in union</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.460" end="01:39:14.360" style="s2">terms one doesn&#39;t develop their shadow</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.900" end="01:39:16.400" style="s2">it develops all on its own just fine you</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.360" end="01:39:17.720" style="s2">integrate it right you have a series of</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.400" end="01:39:19.430" style="s2">encounters with it where you try to</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.720" end="01:39:20.840" style="s2">render it conscious and develop a</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.430" end="01:39:23.480" style="s2">relationship with it that it</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.840" end="01:39:25.850" style="s2">specifically isn&#39;t project formed and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.480" end="01:39:27.440" style="s2">he lays through a set of practices which</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.850" end="01:39:29.750" style="s2">are like here is practically how you</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.440" end="01:39:31.820" style="s2">would go about doing shadow work I was</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.750" end="01:39:33.440" style="s2">very interested in this and so he says</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.820" end="01:39:34.910" style="s2">something basically like you want to pay</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.440" end="01:39:37.280" style="s2">attention to the moments where you were</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.910" end="01:39:39.800" style="s2">experiencing resentment that was like</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.280" end="01:39:41.450" style="s2">okay fair right negative negative</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.800" end="01:39:45.560" style="s2">emotion is a good place to track and</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.450" end="01:39:47.450" style="s2">then he moved from that to and that may</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.560" end="01:39:50.330" style="s2">tell you when something is wrong in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.450" end="01:39:52.220" style="s2">world and you want to stand up because</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.330" end="01:39:57.110" style="s2">is an act of courage to oppose those</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.220" end="01:39:59.480" style="s2">things okay and and then he sort of</p>

<p begin="01:39:59.480" end="01:40:06.020" style="s2">quote that to engage in sort of an act</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.890" end="01:40:08.270" style="s2">of radical honesty is can be as</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.020" end="01:40:10.640" style="s2">effective in a certain sense right as as</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.270" end="01:40:12.740" style="s2">doing psychoanalysis and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.640" end="01:40:14.000" style="s2">that you track your own resentment that</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.740" end="01:40:15.830" style="s2">tells you what&#39;s wrong with the world</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.000" end="01:40:19.310" style="s2">and then you stand up you speak truth</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.830" end="01:40:22.100" style="s2">against that thing and then he&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.310" end="01:40:24.890" style="s2">recipe I think for an encounter with</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.100" end="01:40:27.230" style="s2">your heroic self the courageous oppose</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.890" end="01:40:31.370" style="s2">things you think are evil but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.230" end="01:40:33.830" style="s2">shadow work oh right yeah the very</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.370" end="01:40:36.050" style="s2">nature of that I mean it can&#39;t be shadow</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.830" end="01:40:39.140" style="s2">work to identify something that you find</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.050" end="01:40:41.840" style="s2">by activating an irksome in the world</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.140" end="01:40:44.990" style="s2">and then denounce it that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.840" end="01:40:47.240" style="s2">opposite right wrecker it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.990" end="01:40:51.440" style="s2">in fact what you want to do is track</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.240" end="01:40:53.420" style="s2">your resentment figure out what it is in</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.440" end="01:40:54.980" style="s2">the world that&#39;s causing that right</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.420" end="01:40:56.570" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s triggering you the hopes</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.980" end="01:40:57.820" style="s2">that are triggering you and then use</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.570" end="01:41:00.310" style="s2">that to look within</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.820" end="01:41:02.140" style="s2">and to figure out like what how am i</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.310" end="01:41:04.720" style="s2">involved in this why is it triggering</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.140" end="01:41:06.340" style="s2">for me so I give you an example this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.720" end="01:41:07.750" style="s2">an example that it&#39;s interesting I teach</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.340" end="01:41:10.300" style="s2">with and so it bounds us off</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.750" end="01:41:13.270" style="s2">when I took my first young course at U</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.300" end="01:41:15.850" style="s2">of T I was in the class and there was</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.270" end="01:41:18.190" style="s2">this fellow in the class and every time</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.850" end="01:41:20.260" style="s2">he spoke I experienced this really</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.190" end="01:41:22.660" style="s2">strong like antipathy he drove me really</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.260" end="01:41:24.760" style="s2">crazy he would talk about things and I</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.660" end="01:41:26.170" style="s2">would find myself just simmering right</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.760" end="01:41:28.660" style="s2">at the other side of the room thinking</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.170" end="01:41:31.210" style="s2">to myself all this guy like such a</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.660" end="01:41:32.500" style="s2">know-it-all like big deal like you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.210" end="01:41:34.270" style="s2">about this you know I know about all</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.500" end="01:41:37.090" style="s2">those things like like you really made</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.270" end="01:41:39.250" style="s2">me man so much so that I used to come</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.090" end="01:41:41.200" style="s2">home from that class and gripe to my</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.250" end="01:41:43.300" style="s2">housemates I&#39;d be like that guy was</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.200" end="01:41:44.190" style="s2">talking again and like it really made me</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.300" end="01:41:46.930" style="s2">nuts</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.190" end="01:41:49.960" style="s2">but I was in a class on Union psychology</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.930" end="01:41:52.480" style="s2">so I was also like mmm it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.960" end="01:41:53.470" style="s2">this might be a shadow forever right you</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.480" end="01:41:55.720" style="s2">know it seems like this might be a</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.470" end="01:41:58.360" style="s2">shadow projection so instead what I did</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.720" end="01:41:59.860" style="s2">was I approached him at the end serve at</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.360" end="01:42:02.020" style="s2">the end of class and I said hi you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.860" end="01:42:04.420" style="s2">I&#39;m fine Anderson do you want to go get</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.020" end="01:42:06.610" style="s2">a beer this person was one of my best</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.420" end="01:42:08.260" style="s2">friends now hmm and one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.610" end="01:42:11.680" style="s2">was all of the things that I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.260" end="01:42:14.680" style="s2">reacting to in him are things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.680" end="01:42:16.630" style="s2">like about myself mMmmm right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.680" end="01:42:18.850" style="s2">I you know I have no illusions that I</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.630" end="01:42:21.070" style="s2">both can come off and self-identify as</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.850" end="01:42:24.160" style="s2">kind of a know-it-all in a motormouth</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.070" end="01:42:26.800" style="s2">right and so to the extent that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.160" end="01:42:28.270" style="s2">shadowy trait for me projecting it</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.800" end="01:42:32.200" style="s2">outside and then having this like</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.270" end="01:42:33.760" style="s2">irrational right feeling that tells you</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.200" end="01:42:35.680" style="s2">more about shadow work the same goes for</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.760" end="01:42:37.900" style="s2">the aspects of yourself just because it</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.680" end="01:42:40.660" style="s2">appears monstrous doesn&#39;t mean that it</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.900" end="01:42:43.660" style="s2">is monstrous if you approach it with</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.660" end="01:42:45.490" style="s2">sort of uh you know a stance of charity</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.660" end="01:42:47.080" style="s2">mmm you know you can think about this</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.490" end="01:42:49.480" style="s2">with like the therapeutic work that</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.080" end="01:42:51.010" style="s2">people use with nightmares and lucid</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.480" end="01:42:52.420" style="s2">dreams right he does having a nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.010" end="01:42:54.640" style="s2">where they&#39;re being you know chased by a</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.420" end="01:42:56.140" style="s2">troll or something the idea is for them</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.640" end="01:42:59.350" style="s2">to become sufficiently lucid that they</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.140" end="01:43:00.640" style="s2">turn around and approach and turning</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.350" end="01:43:03.580" style="s2">around and making the approach often</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.640" end="01:43:05.620" style="s2">within the stuff right the the monster</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.580" end="01:43:07.270" style="s2">will cease to be monstrous it will</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.620" end="01:43:08.650" style="s2">transform and then you can actually talk</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.270" end="01:43:09.910" style="s2">to it what do you want all I was just</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.650" end="01:43:11.320" style="s2">trying to get your attention I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.910" end="01:43:13.270" style="s2">that experience right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.320" end="01:43:15.610" style="s2">a standard trope that you see in dreams</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.270" end="01:43:17.920" style="s2">if aspects of your mind can&#39;t get your</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.610" end="01:43:19.960" style="s2">attention they&#39;ve turned the dial up and</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.920" end="01:43:22.960" style="s2">the main dial that they have access to</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.960" end="01:43:24.159" style="s2">is horror right right so they keep</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.960" end="01:43:26.050" style="s2">turning it up until you start having</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.159" end="01:43:28.329" style="s2">nightmares and you pay attention right</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.050" end="01:43:30.520" style="s2">but if you in fact make the approach</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.329" end="01:43:32.920" style="s2">yourself all right we know generally</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.520" end="01:43:35.290" style="s2">within psychotherapy making the approach</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.920" end="01:43:37.030" style="s2">to an object of fear is different than</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.290" end="01:43:38.560" style="s2">the object of the fear coming to you</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.030" end="01:43:40.119" style="s2">yeah of course you get pounced on from</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.560" end="01:43:41.770" style="s2">the bushes that&#39;s one thing you walk</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.119" end="01:43:43.540" style="s2">into the cave it&#39;s something else yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.770" end="01:43:45.219" style="s2">so the idea is to make the approach</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.540" end="01:43:49.320" style="s2">towards the object of your fear and</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.219" end="01:43:52.060" style="s2">hatred and to try to charitably reframe</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.320" end="01:43:53.980" style="s2">to see how you can form some</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.060" end="01:43:56.199" style="s2">relationship with it and make it not so</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.980" end="01:43:59.469" style="s2">bad right it&#39;s there&#39;s an aspect shift</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.199" end="01:44:01.989" style="s2">involved so you know that&#39;s that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.469" end="01:44:05.320" style="s2">of one example where you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.989" end="01:44:07.510" style="s2">sort of recipe that Jordan gave on doing</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.320" end="01:44:10.210" style="s2">shadow work is an interesting recipe</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.510" end="01:44:12.969" style="s2">from the perspective of accessing one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.210" end="01:44:17.050" style="s2">heroic you know like you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.969" end="01:44:18.520" style="s2">mythological you know nature in some</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.050" end="01:44:20.800" style="s2">sense that you&#39;ve also emphasized we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.520" end="01:44:23.349" style="s2">we can overemphasize that too right and</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.800" end="01:44:25.690" style="s2">I think that that too is you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.349" end="01:44:27.780" style="s2">something that may be a bit it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.690" end="01:44:31.179" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think that having us of</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.780" end="01:44:33.610" style="s2">Warrior Ethos can&#39;t be a valuable part</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.179" end="01:44:36.159" style="s2">of self-development but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.610" end="01:44:40.179" style="s2">only game in town yeah and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.159" end="01:44:42.190" style="s2">similarly sometimes I you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.179" end="01:44:45.969" style="s2">for instance we&#39;ll talk about order and</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.190" end="01:44:48.520" style="s2">chaos and the DAO but then he has a</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.969" end="01:44:51.159" style="s2">relatively sort of strident proactive</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.520" end="01:44:52.389" style="s2">and externally focused approach to this</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.159" end="01:44:55.989" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t strike me as particularly</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.389" end="01:44:58.000" style="s2">Taoist at all right have courage act do</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.989" end="01:44:59.079" style="s2">stuff yeah there&#39;s not there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.000" end="01:45:03.250" style="s2">yang but not very much Yin</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.079" end="01:45:05.380" style="s2">right exactly so to me both of those</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.250" end="01:45:09.190" style="s2">things are sort of indicative of a</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.380" end="01:45:11.409" style="s2">somewhat selective or you know I his</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.190" end="01:45:12.699" style="s2">interpretation right it could be just as</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.409" end="01:45:15.040" style="s2">good as mine and it&#39;s possible that he</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.699" end="01:45:17.170" style="s2">has good supports for it but it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.040" end="01:45:19.570" style="s2">to square in some sense how he deploys</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.170" end="01:45:21.670" style="s2">that time and I don&#39;t think Jordan would</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.570" end="01:45:23.679" style="s2">want to nor should his work be set up as</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.670" end="01:45:25.239" style="s2">something that&#39;s beyond criticism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.679" end="01:45:27.610" style="s2">taken that way then</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.239" end="01:45:29.560" style="s2">for me if people are reacting to it that</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.610" end="01:45:31.420" style="s2">way then for me it loses any and all</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.560" end="01:45:33.250" style="s2">intellectual respectability if people</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.420" end="01:45:36.190" style="s2">are simply putting it beyond the pale of</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.250" end="01:45:38.020" style="s2">criticism then that for me has exactly</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.190" end="01:45:39.340" style="s2">the opposite effect it&#39;s like oh well</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.020" end="01:45:42.340" style="s2">then I&#39;m not going to take it seriously</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.340" end="01:45:44.020" style="s2">right and why should I write this brings</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.340" end="01:45:45.460" style="s2">me to dis prints me too actually sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.020" end="01:45:48.160" style="s2">just want to say on that respect I mean</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.460" end="01:45:50.110" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve as I said I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.160" end="01:45:51.580" style="s2">Jourdan a lot and one of the things is I</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.110" end="01:45:53.050" style="s2">mean of course he produces so many</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.580" end="01:45:54.850" style="s2">lecturers so much material so many</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.050" end="01:45:57.430" style="s2">classes right he does tend to orbit</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.850" end="01:45:59.890" style="s2">themes but also the sheer amount of</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.430" end="01:46:01.510" style="s2">stuff that he says means that</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.890" end="01:46:03.460" style="s2">necessarily maybe there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.510" end="01:46:07.030" style="s2">things that don&#39;t yeah right that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.460" end="01:46:09.280" style="s2">but but but on on the other hand that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.030" end="01:46:10.719" style="s2">also something worthy of criticism</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.280" end="01:46:13.120" style="s2">because if you&#39;re going to overwhelm</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.719" end="01:46:14.290" style="s2">people with a large mass you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.120" end="01:46:16.630" style="s2">a lot of work to render it</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.290" end="01:46:18.640" style="s2">systematically coherent so that people</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.630" end="01:46:22.210" style="s2">do have critical access to your work</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.640" end="01:46:25.350" style="s2">right so I wanted to segue into</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.210" end="01:46:28.090" style="s2">something so that criticism you made</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.350" end="01:46:28.989" style="s2">because as you&#39;ve noticed I sort of have</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.090" end="01:46:33.790" style="s2">a criticism</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.989" end="01:46:34.840" style="s2">whereas Jordan seems again there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.790" end="01:46:36.340" style="s2">mass of the work and I have to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.840" end="01:46:39.190" style="s2">careful but I&#39;ve seen a lot too</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.340" end="01:46:41.710" style="s2">thank you yeah and many people are</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.190" end="01:46:43.780" style="s2">taking it this way that young Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.710" end="01:46:46.180" style="s2">seems to ally young with theism and</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.780" end="01:46:47.830" style="s2">particularly with Christian theism in a</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.180" end="01:46:50.560" style="s2">way that for many reasons that we</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.830" end="01:46:52.630" style="s2">covered in our discussion seems to be me</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.560" end="01:46:54.010" style="s2">deeply a mistake and I think you can</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.630" end="01:46:55.719" style="s2">make a much stronger case that young as</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.010" end="01:46:57.489" style="s2">a non theist and I think you can make a</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.719" end="01:46:59.770" style="s2">much stronger case that he&#39;s a gnostic</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.489" end="01:47:01.630" style="s2">and he&#39;s not a Christian and he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.770" end="01:47:04.330" style="s2">fact deeply critical at a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.630" end="01:47:06.400" style="s2">level of what what many people would</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.330" end="01:47:08.620" style="s2">call Christianity yeah so I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.400" end="01:47:11.320" style="s2">tried to sort of square that off too and</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.620" end="01:47:14.140" style="s2">partly as part of an effort to figure in</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.320" end="01:47:15.489" style="s2">what sense Jordan&#39;s a Christian that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.140" end="01:47:17.560" style="s2">tortured question it is a tortured</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.489" end="01:47:19.570" style="s2">question but but I think that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.560" end="01:47:22.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something useful in there okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.570" end="01:47:24.969" style="s2">like to the extent that he is drawing on</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.180" end="01:47:27.070" style="s2">young as being like a central source</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.969" end="01:47:29.969" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay so what are we saying</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.070" end="01:47:33.250" style="s2">here we&#39;re saying that the myths of</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.969" end="01:47:34.590" style="s2">incarnation and sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.250" end="01:47:37.949" style="s2">resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.590" end="01:47:39.750" style="s2">are still relevant right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.949" end="01:47:42.389" style="s2">that&#39;s true I think that those things</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.750" end="01:47:45.570" style="s2">are all true right and they think that</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.389" end="01:47:49.590" style="s2">you know yes it&#39;s also true that you you</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.570" end="01:47:52.710" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sort of you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.590" end="01:47:54.989" style="s2">just throw out the whole mythical</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.710" end="01:47:57.300" style="s2">apparatus of your culture right like</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.989" end="01:47:59.429" style="s2">there&#39;s just too much there and and in</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.300" end="01:48:03.929" style="s2">the West we have done that somewhat you</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.429" end="01:48:05.310" style="s2">know I a critique that I had many years</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.929" end="01:48:07.830" style="s2">ago when we were talking about Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.310" end="01:48:10.860" style="s2">was I think far too many people in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.830" end="01:48:13.619" style="s2">West have sort of sought the exotic ism</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.860" end="01:48:15.630" style="s2">of right Eastern systems rather than</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.619" end="01:48:17.159" style="s2">while they&#39;re going back to sort of try</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.630" end="01:48:20.280" style="s2">to recapture some of that&#39;s nothing and</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.159" end="01:48:24.330" style="s2">I understand why but right so I think if</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.280" end="01:48:26.639" style="s2">if we take that level and just say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.330" end="01:48:28.739" style="s2">yeah Christianity still has some useful</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.639" end="01:48:33.510" style="s2">to borrow our language right some useful</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.739" end="01:48:35.219" style="s2">ciphers ism yes right so you know in</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.510" end="01:48:37.139" style="s2">that sense yeah I agree with you Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.219" end="01:48:38.790" style="s2">not a Christian not in that sense not in</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.139" end="01:48:39.150" style="s2">any kind of traditional conservative</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.790" end="01:48:42.360" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.150" end="01:48:46.099" style="s2">he had extremely like unorthodox</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.360" end="01:48:49.139" style="s2">bordering on heretical and Gnostic views</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.099" end="01:48:51.300" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.139" end="01:48:55.500" style="s2">that that material can&#39;t be used to</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.300" end="01:48:56.760" style="s2">create a kind of regenerate right and I</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.500" end="01:48:58.710" style="s2">think you know Tillich right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.760" end="01:48:59.909" style="s2">reason tilaka gets accused to some</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.710" end="01:49:02.849" style="s2">extent of the same thing there are lots</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.909" end="01:49:05.159" style="s2">of people often called the heretic right</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.849" end="01:49:06.630" style="s2">right because it&#39;s like in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.159" end="01:49:08.489" style="s2">well what he&#39;s talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.630" end="01:49:10.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be our traditional</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.489" end="01:49:11.790" style="s2">Sunday school material that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.080" end="01:49:13.739" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to read Tillich the</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.790" end="01:49:15.690" style="s2">way toward early does with young because</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.739" end="01:49:19.469" style="s2">Tillich shows you somebody who more</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.690" end="01:49:21.570" style="s2">explicitly tries to get this interacting</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.469" end="01:49:24.179" style="s2">with Christianity and what a tough tough</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.570" end="01:49:26.489" style="s2">job it is yes and how much the Christian</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.179" end="01:49:27.360" style="s2">again he bends Christianity explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.489" end="01:49:31.380" style="s2">to non-theism</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.360" end="01:49:32.670" style="s2">right right and so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.380" end="01:49:34.560" style="s2">the tackle but that was an argument I</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.670" end="01:49:35.820" style="s2">wanted to make was there any other point</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.560" end="01:49:37.380" style="s2">you wanted to bring up I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.820" end="01:49:39.210" style="s2">there&#39;s also stuff I&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.380" end="01:49:42.179" style="s2">mention about sort of the treatment of</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.210" end="01:49:43.949" style="s2">symbols that I seems to be implied but</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.179" end="01:49:45.449" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been saying here yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.949" end="01:49:46.790" style="s2">you know there are a couple of angles</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.449" end="01:49:50.030" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.790" end="01:49:53.150" style="s2">so so yeah one is that I periodically I</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.030" end="01:49:54.740" style="s2">find and I think it may be that Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.150" end="01:49:56.750" style="s2">himself doesn&#39;t think this like I think</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.740" end="01:49:58.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an outgrowth of rhetoric or</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.750" end="01:50:00.380" style="s2">something but periodically there is a</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.760" end="01:50:04.940" style="s2">way that he approaches symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.380" end="01:50:08.270" style="s2">interpretation where his language isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.940" end="01:50:09.740" style="s2">tentative enough yeah so you see this so</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.270" end="01:50:11.450" style="s2">sometimes in the biblical series where</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.740" end="01:50:13.760" style="s2">he says this is the interim this is the</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.450" end="01:50:15.500" style="s2">interpretation of XY said and I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.760" end="01:50:16.880" style="s2">know there are versions of this I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.500" end="01:50:18.530" style="s2">think at this point anybody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.880" end="01:50:20.180" style="s2">watched his material has seen you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.530" end="01:50:22.730" style="s2">his unpacking of say the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.180" end="01:50:25.820" style="s2">right which sort of mingles together</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.730" end="01:50:27.650" style="s2">some speculative evolutionary ideas</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.820" end="01:50:32.150" style="s2">about the development of color vision</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.650" end="01:50:33.680" style="s2">snake patterning look fruit and a few</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.150" end="01:50:36.170" style="s2">other things right into sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.680" end="01:50:37.670" style="s2">general this is sort of a routine and</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.170" end="01:50:39.620" style="s2">he&#39;s been you know he&#39;s been teaching</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.670" end="01:50:40.910" style="s2">that routine it&#39;s part of it and I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.620" end="01:50:42.140" style="s2">instructor to I understand what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.910" end="01:50:44.690" style="s2">like to have certain kinds of routines</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.140" end="01:50:45.860" style="s2">you need them you need them so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.690" end="01:50:47.570" style="s2">routine that he&#39;s been running since</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.860" end="01:50:49.550" style="s2">Harvard you can go back and watch him</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.570" end="01:50:53.030" style="s2">deliver some version of that talk in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.550" end="01:50:54.920" style="s2">90s and the problem with it is that</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.030" end="01:50:57.020" style="s2">because it&#39;s insufficiently tentative</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.920" end="01:50:59.420" style="s2">people that don&#39;t have maybe the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.020" end="01:51:01.310" style="s2">depth of experience in treating symbols</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.420" end="01:51:03.380" style="s2">as being multi a spectral and</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.310" end="01:51:06.140" style="s2">inexhaustible have a tendency to treat</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.380" end="01:51:09.710" style="s2">that as a settled interpretation yes and</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.140" end="01:51:11.000" style="s2">central to the notion of the symbol I</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.710" end="01:51:13.430" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what distinguishes a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.000" end="01:51:16.250" style="s2">from a sign yes exist sign means a thing</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.430" end="01:51:19.010" style="s2">and a symbol means a lot of things like</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.250" end="01:51:20.210" style="s2">and and sort of is endlessly disclosing</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.010" end="01:51:22.100" style="s2">that is the whole point of it</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.210" end="01:51:27.590" style="s2">that is why it&#39;s sacred that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.100" end="01:51:32.210" style="s2">useful yes right and and maybe even more</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.590" end="01:51:34.820" style="s2">than that like you know the the the fact</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.210" end="01:51:39.620" style="s2">that the symbol can endlessly disclose</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.820" end="01:51:41.000" style="s2">in this way is part of what structure is</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.620" end="01:51:42.710" style="s2">a bunch of other things in depth</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.000" end="01:51:44.270" style="s2">psychology like there&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.710" end="01:51:45.710" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a book that&#39;s called ten</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.270" end="01:51:48.200" style="s2">thousand dreams interpreted that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.710" end="01:51:49.970" style="s2">serious because people always want that</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.200" end="01:51:51.950" style="s2">they&#39;re like I saw Raven in my dream</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.970" end="01:51:54.620" style="s2">what does it mean and the answer is like</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.950" end="01:51:56.390" style="s2">well that depends right it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.620" end="01:51:57.710" style="s2">take into account cultural levels you</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.390" end="01:52:00.290" style="s2">take into account your personal history</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.710" end="01:52:01.640" style="s2">you take into account your other dreams</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.290" end="01:52:03.530" style="s2">things are never interpreted in</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.640" end="01:52:05.540" style="s2">isolation they&#39;re always interpreted as</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.530" end="01:52:07.790" style="s2">part of because there is a language that</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.540" end="01:52:10.100" style="s2">develops and you know in keeping with</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.790" end="01:52:11.780" style="s2">this like you know it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.100" end="01:52:13.550" style="s2">you are allowing these parts of your</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.780" end="01:52:15.230" style="s2">psyche to plug in to certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.550" end="01:52:17.660" style="s2">machinery you develop a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.230" end="01:52:20.630" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing this kind of work</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.660" end="01:52:21.950" style="s2">right where yeah you get better and</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.630" end="01:52:24.710" style="s2">better at accessing deep layers of</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.950" end="01:52:27.440" style="s2">yourself but also those layers start to</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.710" end="01:52:29.510" style="s2">express things in certain ways I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.440" end="01:52:31.370" style="s2">liked what I&#39;ve been keeping a dream</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.510" end="01:52:33.260" style="s2">journal for years right and I went</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.370" end="01:52:35.780" style="s2">through union therapy and yeah did lots</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.260" end="01:52:37.790" style="s2">of of course works and seminars and</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.780" end="01:52:39.500" style="s2">stuff and I noticed that too you get</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.790" end="01:52:41.180" style="s2">that that there&#39;s a dialogic feel</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.500" end="01:52:42.620" style="s2">totally that comes out of it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.180" end="01:52:44.570" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s there&#39;s an exchange</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.620" end="01:52:46.160" style="s2">back and forth and in some cases like</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.570" end="01:52:47.360" style="s2">you know really it&#39;s funny because when</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.160" end="01:52:50.060" style="s2">I was thinking about the the divine</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.360" end="01:52:52.970" style="s2">double and the aspirational self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.060" end="01:52:54.740" style="s2">like a known quantity with sort of</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.970" end="01:52:57.320" style="s2">analysts and therapists that soon after</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.740" end="01:53:00.200" style="s2">you enter analysis you will often have</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.320" end="01:53:01.670" style="s2">your first analyst dream where you you</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.200" end="01:53:03.560" style="s2">write and that is often a really</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.670" end="01:53:04.820" style="s2">important dream to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.560" end="01:53:07.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s pointing towards some</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.820" end="01:53:08.450" style="s2">future state of self like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.160" end="01:53:12.170" style="s2">this is the kernel of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.450" end="01:53:14.810" style="s2">developing anyway so sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.170" end="01:53:17.540" style="s2">that the the sort of not taking a</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.810" end="01:53:20.360" style="s2">sufficiently tentative line on some of</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.540" end="01:53:22.790" style="s2">the stuff means that the the rhetoric of</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.360" end="01:53:26.000" style="s2">of absolute interpretation enters in</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.790" end="01:53:30.230" style="s2">yeah I agree with that and I see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.000" end="01:53:31.940" style="s2">to me where I don&#39;t know that well if if</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.230" end="01:53:34.040" style="s2">you take the symbol as continually</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.940" end="01:53:34.640" style="s2">disclosing that&#39;s much more Gnostic</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.040" end="01:53:37.100" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.640" end="01:53:39.470" style="s2">whereas if you say this is the and this</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.100" end="01:53:42.200" style="s2">is this is how the symbol is interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.470" end="01:53:44.420" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately just a just a</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.200" end="01:53:47.300" style="s2">two-stage literalism yes right which is</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.420" end="01:53:49.940" style="s2">which is I think deeply and antithetical</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.300" end="01:53:52.220" style="s2">to Jung&#39;s approach to the symbol right</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.940" end="01:53:54.680" style="s2">and so I actually think that that is to</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.220" end="01:53:57.260" style="s2">some extent symptomatic of the other</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.680" end="01:53:58.550" style="s2">trend that I sometimes see in Jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.260" end="01:54:00.860" style="s2">work or at least in the sort of popular</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.550" end="01:54:04.010" style="s2">approach to it which is the the</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.860" end="01:54:06.410" style="s2">fetishization of certainty yes right so</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.010" end="01:54:08.210" style="s2">you know there is a kind of line that</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.410" end="01:54:10.100" style="s2">that runs through I think I first</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.210" end="01:54:11.570" style="s2">encountered this when Jordan delivered a</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.100" end="01:54:13.730" style="s2">talk called the necessity of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.570" end="01:54:14.030" style="s2">which I saw number of years ago and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.730" end="01:54:16.099" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.030" end="01:54:18.289" style="s2">I had the opportunity to sort of have</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.099" end="01:54:20.449" style="s2">coffee and talk to him at length after</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.289" end="01:54:22.969" style="s2">that talk where he had referenced fairly</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.449" end="01:54:24.349" style="s2">heavily Dostoevsky and I ended up having</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.969" end="01:54:27.050" style="s2">a conversation with him where I was like</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.349" end="01:54:28.159" style="s2">okay yes all the stuff about virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.050" end="01:54:29.690" style="s2">good and evil in the knowledge of good</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.159" end="01:54:33.020" style="s2">and evil but Dostoyevsky also said</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.690" end="01:54:35.510" style="s2">beauty will save the world yes and what</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.020" end="01:54:37.280" style="s2">does that mean like how do you plug that</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.510" end="01:54:39.889" style="s2">into what you&#39;re saying about truth and</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.280" end="01:54:41.900" style="s2">good because that&#39;s the third one of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.889" end="01:54:44.090" style="s2">triad and maybe the one that rescues us</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.900" end="01:54:46.059" style="s2">because it&#39;s so much less fraught it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.090" end="01:54:49.130" style="s2">less of a battleground right and</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.059" end="01:54:51.500" style="s2">actually he had to be honest in person a</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.130" end="01:54:53.119" style="s2">far more accommodating and right then</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.500" end="01:54:54.770" style="s2">I&#39;d been that was Jordan - yeah his</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.119" end="01:54:56.030" style="s2">presentation at time that was I think</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.770" end="01:54:58.190" style="s2">maybe the first conversation I ever had</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.030" end="01:55:00.170" style="s2">with him so but but there is this</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.190" end="01:55:03.440" style="s2">approach to certainty and then it goes</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.170" end="01:55:05.960" style="s2">something like this right because you</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.440" end="01:55:08.119" style="s2">know what to do at some level you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.960" end="01:55:10.070" style="s2">what to do and you can tell when you</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.119" end="01:55:15.289" style="s2">know what to do when you do what you</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.070" end="01:55:17.059" style="s2">know no you do what you knew that you</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.289" end="01:55:19.610" style="s2">had to do right because you feel a kind</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.059" end="01:55:21.440" style="s2">of alignment and that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.610" end="01:55:23.000" style="s2">idea and a seductive one I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.440" end="01:55:24.440" style="s2">that idea as you know I I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.000" end="01:55:26.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s true well that&#39;s why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.440" end="01:55:27.409" style="s2">like it I think it&#39;s a dick either to</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.210" end="01:55:29.510" style="s2">tribute that to kind of decadent</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.409" end="01:55:31.400" style="s2">Romanticism so that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.510" end="01:55:34.610" style="s2">problem I mean I sort of run this idea</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.400" end="01:55:36.889" style="s2">through and I think to myself well I</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.610" end="01:55:40.039" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do all of the time</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.889" end="01:55:42.110" style="s2">and and and in Socrates sometimes didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.039" end="01:55:43.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what to do and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.110" end="01:55:45.860" style="s2">me that a great number of people</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.159" end="01:55:47.659" style="s2">certainly in my practice either don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.860" end="01:55:49.730" style="s2">know what to do or experiencing intense</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.659" end="01:55:52.219" style="s2">ambivalence about what to do it can be</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.730" end="01:55:55.460" style="s2">almost as horrible to choose between two</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.219" end="01:55:58.070" style="s2">goods as two evils sure right and so you</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.460" end="01:55:59.449" style="s2">know I think about this and I assume</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.070" end="01:56:01.250" style="s2">somewhere in your series you talked</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.449" end="01:56:03.469" style="s2">about like the way of the wanton and and</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.250" end="01:56:04.699" style="s2">I like this yeah yeah yeah okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.469" end="01:56:06.980" style="s2">think about this sometimes in that term</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.699" end="01:56:09.559" style="s2">I think okay what is the most clarifying</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.980" end="01:56:11.119" style="s2">life event that people often tagged on</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.559" end="01:56:12.889" style="s2">to and one of the ones that you see come</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.119" end="01:56:16.789" style="s2">up in clinical practice is a brush with</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.889" end="01:56:18.860" style="s2">death people will pray for a brush with</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.789" end="01:56:21.500" style="s2">death when they feel confused because it</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.860" end="01:56:22.389" style="s2">will clarify their priorities right if I</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.500" end="01:56:25.269" style="s2">couldn&#39;t if I can</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.389" end="01:56:27.249" style="s2">scat really yep people are just like I</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.269" end="01:56:29.530" style="s2">just want to get hit by bus and be put</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.249" end="01:56:31.689" style="s2">in a body cast for six weeks so that I</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.530" end="01:56:35.320" style="s2">will know what&#39;s really important that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.689" end="01:56:37.119" style="s2">a thing people say so okay interesting</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.320" end="01:56:39.159" style="s2">so I think about that I&#39;m like okay I</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.119" end="01:56:40.419" style="s2">brush with death we take that culturally</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.159" end="01:56:43.449" style="s2">as being one of the most clarifying</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.419" end="01:56:44.829" style="s2">things that we can have happen right but</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.449" end="01:56:46.869" style="s2">there are two responses that you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.829" end="01:56:49.689" style="s2">have to a brush with death and they</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.869" end="01:56:52.780" style="s2">they&#39;re equally credible one is you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.689" end="01:56:54.249" style="s2">say geez like I could get hit by a bus</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.780" end="01:56:57.369" style="s2">tomorrow life is short</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.249" end="01:56:59.889" style="s2">I need to stop focusing on endless</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.369" end="01:57:02.349" style="s2">deferral I need to focus on the now you</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.889" end="01:57:05.110" style="s2">know Yolo like I need to live my life</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.349" end="01:57:06.760" style="s2">and start focusing on right that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.110" end="01:57:09.669" style="s2">response and we look at that and we say</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.760" end="01:57:11.380" style="s2">yep that sounds that sounds very</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.669" end="01:57:14.019" style="s2">plausible to me and then the other</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.380" end="01:57:16.389" style="s2">response is crap I could get hit by a</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.019" end="01:57:18.369" style="s2">bus tomorrow I really got to buckle down</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.389" end="01:57:20.709" style="s2">I got to start thinking about the long</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.369" end="01:57:22.959" style="s2">term yeah I got to stop frittering away</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.709" end="01:57:25.360" style="s2">my long time in this day-to-day way and</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.959" end="01:57:28.059" style="s2">really start considering legacy and we</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.360" end="01:57:30.699" style="s2">think uh-huh and so what is it that</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.059" end="01:57:32.320" style="s2">resolves that within the brush with</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.699" end="01:57:34.059" style="s2">death where does certainty arrive I</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.320" end="01:57:35.949" style="s2">don&#39;t know the brush with death is</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.059" end="01:57:37.419" style="s2">supposed to provide it allegedly but I</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.949" end="01:57:38.769" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that it does that this is</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.419" end="01:57:40.209" style="s2">this is this is one of the central</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.769" end="01:57:42.969" style="s2">points until it right right</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.209" end="01:57:45.010" style="s2">the existential tone us we we most of</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.969" end="01:57:47.769" style="s2">our life is we are facing things that</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.010" end="01:57:49.539" style="s2">are in irresolvable tension with each</p>

<p begin="01:59:22.330" end="01:59:26.770" style="s2">and I think that that you could use that</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.000" end="01:59:30.100" style="s2">as a union statement par excellence</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.770" end="01:59:31.810" style="s2">right very much there are no demons well</p>

<p begin="01:59:41.260" end="01:59:45.100" style="s2">you for that and I think this will be a</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.780" end="01:59:46.960" style="s2">tremendous value of people who are</p>
