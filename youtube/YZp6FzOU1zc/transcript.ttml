<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">information we get ever since we got 24</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">7 news and after 9 11 we have slowly</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">been divided to a point where even a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">family dinner feels like walking a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">minefield</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">so thank you for that and the second</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">comment is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">your discord is my new social media just</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">voting with my dollar here</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:16.880" style="s2">call it a paid review by me worth the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">buy-in awesome</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.880" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">thank you for that as well this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">one of two questions uh then that i will</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">that we will address from episode 40</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t get to last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">in what way are you progressive you guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">seem very liberal what are some</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">progressive policies you want what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">your ideal progressive</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">leadership well that&#39;s a tough one</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">i have to say um as much as people swear</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">that the distinctions between</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">leftist liberal progressive</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">uh are clear i&#39;ve never understood them</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">as somebody who&#39;s been on the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">all my life i certainly remember a point</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">where the term liberal had been</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">stigmatized so badly that i started</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">referring to myself as a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">just simply to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">not have the conversation bogged down</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">immediately so at least at that point</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">i think the distinction was an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">one at best</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">i would say the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">the thing that causes me to say that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">is that i believe we have to change we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">have to make a kind of progress</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">in order to survive that our system is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">on a fatal trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">short term that it contains many of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">right elements but that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">introduce some new structure and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">basically the founders didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">evolution and so they didn&#39;t build a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">system that was robust to the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">of let&#39;s say mechanisms of capture</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">so i would just say i derive the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">meaning of the word progressive from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">fact that we need progress i believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">that progress is essential</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">but i don&#39;t believe almost any of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">things that many who would call</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">progressive claim to want or say that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">so i believe we have to make progress</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s about as far</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">as uh that allegiance goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find others</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">in that movement who had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">feeling but in general what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">progressives claim to want is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">yeah i guess i would i would just add</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">many have noted that we often talk in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">terms that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">um putting a lot of weight</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">on individual responsibility and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">know personal responsibility and such</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">and and we do but that is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">contradicted by also seeing a need</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">for uh collective action for those</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">problems and issues in society</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">that will be gamed by individuals if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">don&#39;t have a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">by which you can prevent them being</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">gamed and so systems like</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">well like health care</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">we can do better than what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">have the united states</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">in which you have insurance companies</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">vying for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">the dollars of people without actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">any increase in the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">health care we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">i would just add to these two things</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">already on the table that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">in general i find that liberals</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">are more likely to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">inequality in the current system that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">worthy of and demanding of a solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">and i do believe our system has many</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">biases in it that are worthy</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">of a solution conservatives tend to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">the system as more functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">and ultimately as you&#39;ve probably heard</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">us say</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">or me at least the aim</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">of a liberal the aim of a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">to create a society that is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">that one would be a fool to attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">change it to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">in other words perfection is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">a system that works really really well</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">is something that you should leave</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">functional and i don&#39;t believe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">there yet i believe we have a long way</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">um but the goal of everyone should be to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">create a society that is so good that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">they now want to conserve it thus the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">goal of everyone should be turned to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">able to turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">everyone into conservatives not</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">for a past that that already exists but</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">a future that we would like to create</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">and then can try to conserve</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">and i think as has been noted across</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">many domains now part of what is going</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">on with this movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">not so much what we see on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">although i think there is some element</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">of that as well but for instance</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">um on camp in campuses and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">corporations where you have the creation</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">suave this whole divisions devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">diversity equity and inclusion these</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">officers</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">are these diversity equity inclusion</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">um a world you know have have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">have themselves created a world</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">that then requires that they never</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">actually do the job that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">pretending that they&#39;re claiming to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">because if they did so they would put</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">themselves out of work and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">you know what what we should all be</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">doing is you know those of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">who you know have jobs that are specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">activists and you know die officers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">should if if they are in any way being</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">about their stated goals and aims they</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">they should be trying to put themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">out of the particular kind of work that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">they are currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">so i think this also now that i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">about it creates a taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">conservatives that i think i had not</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">uh formalized yet um that there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">three reasons in light of what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">just said about progressives and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">liberals</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">there are three reasons that you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">on the conservative side one of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">is that you believe that the system is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">in a place where change is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">more harmful than it is desirable</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">the second you&#39;re not inherently opposed</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">to the idea of change you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">should all be shooting for is that state</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">the second</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">is that you might be insensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">problems that might be solved in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">system in other words you might regard</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">it as</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">fairer than it is because maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">not in one of the categories to which it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">is routinely unfair</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">or something like that and the third are</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">people for whom the system is biased who</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">might like to conserve those biases</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">and so i sometimes think that liberals</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">what they see wrong with conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s all that last category</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">right and it isn&#39;t right i i run into</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">all three of these types and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">anyway i probably worth keeping in mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">that&#39;s really good three types of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.120" style="s2">conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">and uh you know one of those types is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.120" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">type that even</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">uh honorable liberals should be aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">to join that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">good what is the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">drug addiction why are there withdrawals</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">for something that slowly kills you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">lovely love you thanks and unity for to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">win all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">unity for to win um you want me to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">sure yeah so first of all i should say</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s an old model of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">which i&#39;m convinced has some truth in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">but has been replaced by a new and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">better model of addiction so the old</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">model of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">was based on heroin primarily highly</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">addictive drug</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">that mimics the molecular structure of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">endorphins</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">and the idea is that your body produces</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">these molecules</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">to keep you for example from being</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">by um sensation</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">by pain in particular so you have all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">these systems across your body that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">detecting</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">damage and pain and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">they are you are under sensitive to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">so you are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">for example constantly paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">to what&#39;s going on on your arms and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">of this so you can pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">you need to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">so these molecules that we make that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">limit sensation</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">are something you can trigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">artificially with a plant-made molecule</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">a molecule that the plant makes in order</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">to keep herbivores from eating it</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">and the thing is your body is monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">how many of these molecules you need so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">to the extent that you are supplementing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">those molecules your body</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">starts making less and less of them so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">if you overwhelm your system</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">with these molecules maybe you get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">pleasant sensation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">numbness or whatever it is but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">sending a message into the system that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">causes a reduced production of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">endogenous molecules</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">and at the point that you try to remove</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">the supplement</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t have enough of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">since you&#39;re suddenly overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">by the sensations that you were blocking</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">out and it takes time</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">right the withdrawal period it takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">time to go back to producing normal</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">levels of these things so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">kicking the habit involves basically a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">dysfunction and so the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get off heroin because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">very painful as a result of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">imbalance and that keeps people who do</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">heroin doing more heroin</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">the new model of addiction suggests</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">uh and there&#39;s a great deal of truth in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">this too that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">creatures all of us tend to make these</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">bad choices about ingesting these</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">molecules</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">when we don&#39;t have things that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">rewarding available to us</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">right and so uh you know a rat in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">boring cage</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">may press the cocaine lever again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">again but a rat that has entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">things to do is much less likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">whatever substance is on offer and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">you will also recognize that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">mirrors what you see in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">people with bad options often do get</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">addicted to drugs</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">and this goes to one of my philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">principles which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t hold people responsible</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">for bad decisions when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">only had bad decisions available to them</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to conflate cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">quite possible that you have sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">an exacerbating effect where someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">with bad options was more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">become addicted and of course becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">addicted it reduces their options</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">uh which causes them to be even more</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">prone to addiction perhaps of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">a greater a greater extent or of more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">substances etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">totally so um i would say a number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna try to make sure we answer the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">exact question we were asked i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in there there&#39;s a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">what we&#39;ve said that&#39;s relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">the question but you know so basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">you have a physical system that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">disrupting in some sort of pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">way and the removal of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">leaves a disrupted system which is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">good options defeat bad options</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">which suggests a that you know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">that makes me angriest</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">about what i was told about drugs when i</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">was young is that drugs was even a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">because drugs isn&#39;t a category right</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">drugs are many different substances some</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">of which you may</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re trying to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">certain things these may be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">the most powerful tool in the arsenal</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">right in the case of things like uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">right it&#39;s a very powerful tool i would</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">these none of these should be treated</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">recreationally though you should</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">potentially have fun in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">many of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">but but just i mean you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">psilocybin and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">and other hallucinogens slash entheogens</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">um psychedelics you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">words mean slightly different but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">largely overlapping things</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">um are interesting in that almost none</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">actually have physically addicting uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">right that you actually uh don&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">no people who are physically addicted or</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">would experience withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:48.639" style="s2">um from not taking mushrooms anymore uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">they might well miss them</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">if yeah and especially if it&#39;s if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">is micro dosing regularly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">helping</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">alleviate anxiety uh for instance</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">uh they might see a decline in mental</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">health as a result but</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">in terms of physical addiction the model</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">that you laid out bret</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">for what happens with heroin uh is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just not the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">thing and so this is this is exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">we we object</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">to this idea that you know drugs is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">category that makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">much sense um you know you at least have</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">to include</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">um you know caffeine and nicotine in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">in the drug category and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">caffeine and nicotine</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">are a much better match for the model</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">that includes heroin</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">than are any of the entheogens or</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">hallucinogens</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">yeah so um i guess i would just</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">say finally that basically all of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:46.639" style="s2">argues that there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">matrix of characteristics that you ought</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">to be thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">before you decide to engage one of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">substances and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">you know in the case of heroin probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">just too</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">freaking dangerous to be worth toying</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">with it at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">on the other hand that molecule taken in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">another another way might be something</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">manageable right what you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">get into is a situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">in which um the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">solution to the degradation of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">function of the molecule is more of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">molecule</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">or you get into a positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">situation where</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">in order to deal with the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">effectiveness of the molecule you become</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">addicted to greater and greater amounts</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">of it or something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">and that&#39;s i mean i think that is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">answer to the question about withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">right like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t expect withdrawal uh for</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">uh for something like mushrooms um</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">but anything to which your body has</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">become accustomed and as therefore</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">uh either down regulated production of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">the thing in question</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">in the case of of heroin and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">the similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">opiates of the opioids that the body</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">itself produces</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">or is otherwise accommodating um</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t actually have a good model</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">in my head i want i was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">your body is otherwise accommodating for</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">the intake</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">and therefore if you start um reducing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">it your body&#39;s going to go out of whack</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">but like with alcohol i actually i do</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">not have a good model for what like</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">alcohol withdrawal and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">and and such is about i don&#39;t have i</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know any close stories and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t have a good model of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">that is yeah i mean i think we can say</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">something general and it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">knows the specifics but the body</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">is capable of applying some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">resource so to the extent that alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">disrupts your ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">to accomplish something maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">numbs your senses uh some part of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">ratchet up heightened sensitivity right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">yeah negate the effect but it may</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">compensate for the effect to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s going to be compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s going to be compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">in some way and it also you know no</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">doubt</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:06.839" style="s2">there are just simply costs</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">to producing the detoxifying</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.839" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">equipment um and so anyway that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">uh it may be that withdrawal has to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:16.959" style="s2">with the fact that if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">if you drink a lot very regularly and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">then suddenly you&#39;re not drinking but</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">you&#39;re ratcheted up</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all these molecules that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">no uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">no job no job that may be costly too in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">some way</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">yeah okay let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">do you think holidays have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">evolutionary component to them</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">about every culture has them do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">think a holiday like halloween</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">might act as a way to teach our children</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">in um some you know not so terrific</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">um original you know sort of founding</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">however remains one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">holidays that is least touched by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">market you know other than turkey</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">farmers there&#39;s not a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">you know explicitly benefit and profit</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">from from the holiday and it really</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">tends to be a time</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">when at least some form of friends or</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">family come together and share good food</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">and break bread together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">and hopefully to some degree discuss</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">some of the things that they are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">thankful for</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">so far so you and i for years have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">tinkering with holidays</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">feeling that many of them maybe not up</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">to date and we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">uh in particular modified both hanukkah</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:46.559" style="s2">and christmas</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">to modernize them or to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.559" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">update them in some way i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">actually now that you mention it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">thanksgiving doesn&#39;t need to be modified</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">too i&#39;ve been hesitant about</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">thanksgiving because since it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">effectively the only important holiday</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">uh captured by the market captured by uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">by market forces it seems like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">touch it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">on the other hand i&#39;m wondering if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit a little bit with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">the question of unity and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">right in other words there is some</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">aspect of thanksgiving which is about</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">breaking bread</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">with somebody on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">something yeah and if that could not be</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">if it could not be made into a healing</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">holiday if</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">in effect i would say sitting down with</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">across some unbridgeable divide and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">breaking bread with them</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">is inherently positive and it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">inherently american</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">oh absolutely that&#39;s that&#39;s wonderful um</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">to the second part of the question about</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">halloween i</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about halloween</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">actually which is never</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">it was never a holiday that i was</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">particularly into i just you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">cosplay wasn&#39;t my thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">and uh so much of what is happening on</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">the streets is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s cosplay and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">unfortunately a lot of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">in some of the you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">fringe</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">elements of um you know for instance</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">trans activism</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">is actually cosplay as well and um you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">not allowed to say that but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">make it any less true</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">uh and i i think you know halloween</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">is pretty ridiculous in its american</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">form but you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">much beloved and you know we encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">our children</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">as long as they wanted to to to do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">although our elder son zach resisted the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">the market part of it from a very early</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">age and we can tell some</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">stories about that at a different time</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">but i do think that we are missing uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">in some parts of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s some celebration of mardi</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">gras which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">again just this bastardization of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">carnival</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">and you know carnival is a depending on</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">are in latin america originating from</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">you know the combination</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">of the sort of you know animist</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">of the original people with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">catholicism that came in with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">spaniards and the portuguese</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">and you have for a few days</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">before lent is to start before you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">to give up something and basically live</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">your your best and most pure life for</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">a lot of time for 40 days i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">you get to just party right and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that americans understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">you just do a party and you drink and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">well that&#39;s a ridiculous pasteurization</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">lucky and unlucky enough to be present</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">for several carnivals</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">in um in panama and in ecuador on i</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">guess three different occasions</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">and some of them have been ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">and some of them have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">amazing and what you see when it works</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">is exactly what carnival and actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">the first time before i knew i was going</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">to be in all these cases it was with</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">study abroad classes so i was there with</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">my students</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">and before i went down and you know i</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">hadn&#39;t planned for us to be</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">who had taught my brazilian society and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">culture class when i had been an</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">undergrad and who would</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">who had taught me what i knew about</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">carnival which was entirely at that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">point in abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">and who himself worked um on the um</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">on the atlantic coast of of brazil near</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">um exit to i think near the exit of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">amazon near belem</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">and one of the things that he said that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">was most</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">impactful to me which i then shared with</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">my students before we went</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">and experienced this thing firsthand was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s an exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">liminality it&#39;s an exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">borders and which borders</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">um are there and you can touch them and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">you can push them and they deform a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">little bit but they&#39;re always going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">bounce</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">back and which ones actually can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">reversed and which ones can be reversed</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">for a day and you can experience life as</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">the other and you&#39;re definitely going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">go back</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">and so the exam the three examples that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">i remember he gave</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">were male female and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">parent child and employer employee</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure that last one had um sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.280" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">slave and owner manifestations in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">past but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s not what is going</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">on now and just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">to switch your position you know choose</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">one of those or some</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">other dichotomy or not it could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">something with something with more roles</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">than two</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">and try on a different mantle for a day</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">for a few days</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">and know that at the end of it unless</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">you know grotesque unless you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">something truly awful you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">explore space</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t otherwise explore and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">then you get to go back to your life and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">and think on it and learn from it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">have a better sense of what the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">people in your life are also living like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">all right two things to add to that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">i have some trepidation about but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">go there anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">i want to just say that time we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">together in ecuador for</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">carnival um in cowenka and 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">in cuenca in 2016 30 of our students and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">we were in two children</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">for 14 days yeah we were that was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">longest place we were in our 11 week</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">trip through</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">ecuador we were in cuenca for 14 days so</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">this was a place where the students were</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">all living in their own</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">states in their own home stays and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">know they knew the town they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">walking around it and so carnival</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">happened and you know we would intersect</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">walking through the square or anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">but we weren&#39;t all together as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">group in the same way 34-person mob</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">going through carnival</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">right so anyway it was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">some of them got themselves into some</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">and um you know all sorts of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">happened but</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">we were able to observe and participate</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">uh so in</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">cuenca and in ecuador more generally one</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">that goes on during carnival is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">people buy</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">this bottled foam and they shoot it at</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">each other so you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">boys might shoot it at girls that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">are fond of or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">but people are spraying uh other people</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">we got sprayed for being gringos and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">that was to stall in keeping with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">um but one of the things i remember um</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">being struck by was that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">police band</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">oh and you took a beautiful picture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">i got a nice picture yeah if i know we</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">were gonna talk about this i would have</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">found it but anyway a little girl on</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">her dad&#39;s shoulders looking at a police</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">brass band marching down and being</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">covered in foam people are just</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">attacking the police with this foam</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">and i was thinking at the time that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">actually this was a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">healthy phenomenon the band you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">police were not freaking out they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">continuing to play</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">it was all something you know by</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">stepping in one guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">trombone maybe it was like filled with</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">foam even yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">so anyway imagine how healthy it is to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">have that relation that is the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">relationship with the police</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">all cops are bastards right all cops are</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">bastards you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">to interact with them in any human way</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">is unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">versus oh you know what there&#39;s one day</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">a year where i&#39;m gonna shoot that cop</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">has been giving me trouble or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">shoot him with foam with foam right</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">exactly so um so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">the other thing also involves a cop the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">dhs officer that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">mentioned on the stream and have taken</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">so much crap for talking to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">how dare you yeah how dare you talk to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">cop but anyway among the many</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">interesting things he told me</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">is about the training that he and his</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">fellow dhs officers had gone through</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">uh in order to deal with uh riots and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">protests and the like</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">and it involved all kinds of things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">uh enduring</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">uh tear gassing they you know they had</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">they were themselves tear-gassed he did</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">it on multiple occasions</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">um and there was also some sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">where they</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">traded off uh basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">playing at being protesters and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">uh and all these things and he describes</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">basically these war games between</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">dhs officers playing the dhs role and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">dhs</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">officers playing the protesters role and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">and the goal is not how better to harm</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">right goal is how to be a better dhs</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">officer how to be a better policeman</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">and those better better policemen better</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">dhs</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">officer does not mean how can i hurt</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">other people the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">no in fact in fact the thing that struck</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">me the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">was that actually a he saw his</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">role as protective that the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">he feared was that he was being boxed</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">into a situation by protesters in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">violence would be the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">protect</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">the buildings in question and he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">want people to get hurt his point was</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to allow them to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">the buildings we can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">so anyway there was that but also you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">know he described</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">his own how much fun it was to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">other side of this line</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">and you know he basically it was clear</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">that he was into it and he understood</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">about you know that&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">what is motivating these protesters is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">about fun but there is some aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:31.919" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">they do clearly enjoy their role and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.919" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">um it was interesting to hear you know i</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">one side demonizing the other i did not</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">hear him demonizing the protesters as</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">troubling as it was to have them uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">launching</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">ball bearings with slingshots and things</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">like that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">okay next question is there an</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:52.480" style="s2">evolutionary explanation</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">for how something like placebo would</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.480" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">come into existence</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">is it maybe a side effect of some other</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">feature that was naturally selected</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">oh you&#39;re going to hate this answer you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">just i apologize for it in advance</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">but that placebo effect that you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">exists it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">there is a placebo effect but it works</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">if you have a condition in which the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">manifestation of the condition is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">like i feel pain or i feel anxiety then</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">placebos</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">will actually address it and you will</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">feel less</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">anxiety or less pain but this does not</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">in things like longevity if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">that reduces your longevity and you take</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">a placebo</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">there is no evidence that supports the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">idea that you will live longer</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">or that you will basically anything</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">that&#39;s objective rather than subjective</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">does not respond to this and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">um you are absolutely correct in asking</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">this question that if placebo existed in</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">the form that people</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">think it exists that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">evolutionary paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">major proportions because why is it if</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">you have the capacity to heal</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">that you don&#39;t just simply heal if</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">somebody by lying to you about</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">some treatment they&#39;ve given you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">trigger an endogenous system for healing</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">and the endogenous system should</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">uh trigger itself so anyway i am already</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">anticipating a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">great deal of hate mail that i will get</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">over this one i will be told that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">placebo effect</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">does exist and that i will be pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">a thousand things that will not reflect</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">and i appreciate all of them let me tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">and uh i don&#39;t know i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s where it lands so</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">can you feel better by being told you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">been given some treatment that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">um yes you can if it&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">and i think the interpretation for why</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">that would be is somewhat obvious</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">right in other words how focused on</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">something subjective like pain should</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">you be</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">is a question of what situation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">in right if you&#39;re at home</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">and you&#39;ve damaged your limb and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">need not to pick stuff up maybe you need</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">to be focused on that pain</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">if you&#39;re still on a battlefield maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">you need to ignore that pain so you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">survive to get home and focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">and so we have systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">modulatable for this reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">that are subjective uh and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">to modulate them</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">uh makes sense from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">in the spirit of truth seeking can you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">brett clarify a statement that you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">made several times</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">black lives are undervalued by whom</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">brett are they undervalued specifically</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">by us collectively and i hesitate to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">includes black people but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">degree into which there there is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">um an expectation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">misfortune befalling black people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">has just been</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">um i think absorbed into</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">the culture and what it means is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">you know i mean this has been pointed</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">out in certain contexts like the degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">to which people freak out</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">when a white woman has disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">compared to a black woman i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">if this has been quantified but there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">for society to empathize more in certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">cases than others</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">and i think it really does have</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">significant effects you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">a crisis is less of a crisis when it</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">to a black neighborhood and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">that&#39;s something we have to address now</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think you can address it by</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:38.720" style="s2">wagging your finger at people that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">going to work</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.720" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">we can address it structurally and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">know i find myself in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">than many of the people in our social</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">um with respect to things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">do we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">you know black focused hero narratives</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.799" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">right i actually think we probably do</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ve gotten some pushback from</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">black people on this right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">concession i shouldn&#39;t make but</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">i really believe it it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">you can&#39;t empathize with a character</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t look like you i think you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">can and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">hope that we will all do that trick um</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">you know i certainly empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">female characters</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">and i empathize with black characters</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">but to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">that for especially for younger kids</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">some tendency to more easily project</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">the role of somebody who in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">superficial way looks like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">i think it would be healthy and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">great thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">that we get society to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">those superficial characters</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">characteristics matter so little that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">all of these narratives become available</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">right and that the the really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">uh well suffice it to say it should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">about the content of their character</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">rather than the color of the skin of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">protagonists i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">i think i think you&#39;re demonstrably</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">right that the younger the child the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">more suggestible they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">and if they only see narratives</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">of of people being heroic who don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">like them</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">it it might be a conclusion that at</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">least some of those children</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">come to um that they therefore you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t made of the right stuff to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">heroic what we see</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">a hundred percent is this recognition</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">being gamed</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know that it is being gamed</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">racially i hope not i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">actually know what that would look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">although i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">sure we&#39;ll hear from people who can</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">point me to some examples but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">hundred percent being gained by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">by the trans rights activists and um the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">that you put in front of little children</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">are maybe you know maybe maybe not the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">sex that their parents say they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">when in fact we know this to be an</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">incredibly rare condition</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">that is not created by reading a book or</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">wanting to cosplay as a kid or wanting</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">to play around with gender norms because</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">that&#39;s in part what childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">adolescence is about</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">this this in part this successful gaming</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">um of narrative and playing on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">suggestibility of young children and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">gullibility of parents is part of why we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">are in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">the bad position we&#39;re in right now with</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">so-called trans people among teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">i also wonder if um marketing culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">has exacerbated something terribly and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">basically because marketers profit by</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">making people insecure about something</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">that they then</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">can be sold a solution to that we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.040" style="s2">been sold archetypes that are far</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">narrower than they might otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.040" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">and in fact yeah women</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">when it played sorry but it plays too on</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">um the insecurity of parents i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">for people who aren&#39;t parents you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">necessarily know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">um parents are expected to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">uncomfortable and unsure about what</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">in in modern culture and those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">are like well no we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">know what we&#39;re doing but let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">it out as we go along</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">and let&#39;s not look to authority for</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">answers but try to deduce from observing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">our children and ourselves and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t um how best to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">to interact and always do so with love</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">we found ourselves rare among parents</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">who we interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">in not feeling it necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">look for authoritative sources on how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">was that we were supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">and given given that and given that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">know the market is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">and um it is bullying people into</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">suggesting that they have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and they really need to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">something different and they need to buy</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">this in order to fix the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s that they&#39;re causing</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">um that i think actually it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:53.599" style="s2">the suggestibility of little children</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">but the gullibility of the parents who</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.599" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">are buying these products</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">because they&#39;re being told by some</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">number of forces some of which are</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">not good at all that if they do not</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">affirm their child&#39;s gender identity for</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">instance right this very moment that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">they are being bad parents</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s gaming appearance not</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">just destroying children and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">the destruction of children is far more</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">important but hey parents</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">try not to be gamed if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">chance that this is going to cost you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">some money to be gamed</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a good chance that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going on being gamed</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">yeah absolutely um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">and many people are trying to sell you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">one wrong idea or another for various</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">you know in the case of marketers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">the most obvious um</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">but they&#39;re all kinds of bad ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">to parenting that have been floated i</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">was just going to add that when when we</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">have traveled especially</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">latin america is the place where i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">been most systematic about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">but i have frequently gone into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">cosmetic section of supermarkets</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve discussed this</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">before publicly but um the wall of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">for example um hair care products</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">you know or baby products too</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">they represent an archetype of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">people should look like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">far it&#39;s definitely latinized</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">but it is very light-skinned</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">it is very often a blonde white woman</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">right well</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">no i see more it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">latinas but very very</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">light-skinned leaning very much towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">the north american aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">which is itself being pushed by</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">an advertising industry that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">is using</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">dissatisfaction to to sell people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">but anyway the difference you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">supermarket&#39;s a great place because</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right there with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re right there with the image</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re being sold</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">and the two are not a match and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s very striking once you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">tune into it because at home we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">ignore</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">what&#39;s on the shelf we try to because</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s an attack on us yep</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something that we learn to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">ignore but tuning back in is very useful</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">i mean this actually this this will be</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">totally not obvious to people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">um to most people that um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">things that we find</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">value in in travel is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">spending time when we&#39;re not deep in</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">nature when we&#39;re actually in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">town</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">exploring like sure we explore the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">you know the churches and the museums</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">and you know and whatever it is that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">you know hang out in the squares and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">eat the local food and you know see if</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">we can talk to local people but</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">also going into hardware stores and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">going into markets</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">and just spending time in the space with</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">the local people are buying the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">that they need to do the stuff of their</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">from a hardware store you can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">what kinds of problems they&#39;re having to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">and you know in in we started doing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">when we were both doing graduate work</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">um in would have been costa rica and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">panama and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">you know i would find myself going into</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">a hardware store because i really needed</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">a bunch of netting and you know chords</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">and like okay how am i going to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">this big enclosure that i have to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">uh with what&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">and so it was driven by my desire to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">solve a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">you you learned a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">about what problems were being solved by</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">the local people as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">and you know because because it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a home depot or a low it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">probably i mean it is in the big cities</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">down there at this point but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">you know the local hardware store tells</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">you something just like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">local feed store</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">in a small u.s town will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">something about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">the local economy and the local people</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">and local culture in a way that the lows</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">at the you know city 30 miles up the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">road won&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">absolutely and if you&#39;re in a very hot</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">place where you can&#39;t escape the heat</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">you can also go into a supermarket and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">pretend to be buying cheese which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">something i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">proud that we&#39;ve done we did that in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">venice last year actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">it was hot it was really hot it was hot</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">and the cheap sometimes you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">actually open the cheese case in order</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.800" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">figure out if you want cheese that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">bridge too far but um</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">but pretending to buy cheese is uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">well within your right as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">north american i see okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">um imagine sometime</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">within the next year you stumble across</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">your ideal website for consuming general</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">news are there any characteristics in</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">its content or structure that come to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">mind that would make it stand out to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">yeah i mean i think you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">getting such a large dose of this if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">you&#39;re a fan of this channel that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">um this will not come as news but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">actually you know the way to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t actually know i feel like i</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">have lots of answers and none of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">pithy enough here&#39;s the thing we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">popular as professors you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">top level popular um for various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">right one of them had to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">fact that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">leveled with our students which meant</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:41:59.839" style="s2">that there were several things that were</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">unusual in other</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.839" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">contexts that our students found with us</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">one was</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">we told them things that were</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">and then we helped them sort through it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">when we were wrong we told them we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">been wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">and so a news channel that pretends to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">um just simply accurate at a factual</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">and does not behave properly in the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">that it is revealed to be otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">is obviously a dangerous structure so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">i would just say a newscast that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">honest about what it didn&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">honest about the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">biases</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">that impact coverage no matter what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">do right it&#39;s not like there is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">objective way to report</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">stories but being honest about</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">and um tracking i think maybe the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">important thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">would be how well did the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">viewpoint and the report stand up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">what followed</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">right was it borne out by what followed</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">or not so the predictive capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">is important yeah and for some reason as</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">what came to mind was a class that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">had ended before we showed up but when</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">we started graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">at the university of michigan we were</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">told that there had been a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">taught by correct me if i&#39;m wrong don</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">tinkel and dick alexander</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">i think dick alexander who was your</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">major phd advisor and he was on my</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">committee</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">and don tinkle was was dead by the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">that we were there</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">um and this to people who aren&#39;t in uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">sort of organismal biology space this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">will seem like how different could they</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">but the two of them taught this course</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">in which dick was basically the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">evolutionist</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">and don was the ecologist and they went</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">at each other because very often</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">evolutionary approaches to questions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">ecological approaches to questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">um are dissimilar enough um they that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">they just</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">like ships passing in the night they</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">can&#39;t even see each other they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">see that they&#39;re addressing the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">question in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">and so this class which had run for</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">many years at the graduate level at</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">michigan was apparently</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">incredibly powerful also incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">popular</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">but incredibly powerful precisely</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">because because it had two people</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">who were both giants in their field who</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">like really were excellent scientists</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">and also had great personal respect for</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">one another and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">really deeply disagreed with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">what the other person had to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">and so i mean that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">that that we also did that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">successful in the classroom that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">would disagree</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">and yet we like it was clear we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">married and we appeared to be happily</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">married and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">you know we were doing we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">what we were doing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">perfectly willing if one of us was up on</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">the stage um the other one would raise</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">your hands like no i think you got that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">and the students could see the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">disagreement in real time</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">with no animus and this is what um don</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">tinkle and dick alexander did</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">and i know it&#39;s been tried in various</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">ways in the news</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">over over the decades sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">successfully some very often not but</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know if anyone is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:23.359" style="s2">attempting that at this point so i would</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">i would like uh you know what do you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.359" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">an ideal website you know like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">i i would like some some things</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">that don&#39;t just have one person trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">to take you know try and you know go</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">watch the the democratic convention the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">republican convention and report back</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">um but maybe even you know fairly you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">know polarized entrenched people but</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">good</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong and who can see the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">of the other side</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">going at it over ideas that they really</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">disagree about</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">yeah it has to be uh i mean the funny</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">iconic example of this was crossfire</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">and i must say tucker carlson when he</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">was on</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">crossfire i found to be an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">troubling human being</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">right um in his later incarnation i</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">frequently find</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">that i&#39;ve this weird fact of him talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">about things that are traditional</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">left of center territory like class</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">warfare he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">very honest about class warfare about</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s bad for average</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">um that his class won and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">frustrated that there&#39;s nobody on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">other side properly articulating</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">the counterpoint so it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">what crossfire didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">manage to be is something he has taken</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">up doing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">later in life and you know i i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">alone yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting um it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">interesting transition</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">but i do think we need a version of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">it has to not be driven by whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">crossfire was driven by</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">and it can&#39;t be phony um but</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">there&#39;s real room for something lincoln</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">douglas debate style where people</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">with honest disagreements but respect</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">for each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">tangle yeah and you know this is what</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">idw was exploring</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">right and maybe you know not you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">sort of the extremes of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">two hosts that are always the host and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">always will be and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">you know after a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">probably you know for for many people it</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">that dynamic may start to get stale or</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">you may start to get entrenched because</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what people are expecting now</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">um or always guests which don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">necessarily you know they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">just get</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">their leg in you know their foot in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">door and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">they won&#39;t be take as many risks they</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">should etc but you know something like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">rotating stable of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">16 20 people or something who come to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">each of those other 16 or 20 people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">you know always rotated in and will have</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you would end up with you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">i really like you know i really like</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">being on</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">stage with those three guys and not</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">those three and here are the ones that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">um but to at least keep it it would keep</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">it a little bit more surprising</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">and would i think um avoid some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">problems of both of the extremes</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">yeah um well i&#39;d like to see it happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">oh boy we&#39;ve only we&#39;ve gotten through</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">so few questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">um there is only racism or lack of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">there is no reverse racism or</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">anti-racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">racism can exist in degrees it is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">dichotomous</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">so i think i basically agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">although it is not dichotomous would</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">contradicted by your initial statement</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">there&#39;s only racism or lack of racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">but i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">no no no i i think i i know what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">point is here that it&#39;s a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a continuum and it may not</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">even have a discrete</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">starting point which is why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">hanging up on there is only</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">there is no um where is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">there is only racism or lack of racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">so the lack of a discreet starting point</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">is a challenge to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">yep um you know where it is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">have to define some</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">level below which it&#39;s not racism yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">but uh i</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna push back slightly i actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">think racism</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">naturally is a term that just simply</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">stems from a race first view of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">and so i agree to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">there is something different when a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">powerful group</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">engages in a race first view</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">it is different in some way than</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:42.040" style="s2">when a disempowered group engages in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">race first</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.040" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">thinking um so</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">i think the problem is that is not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">match for racism</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">right that whatever racism um plus</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">uh the oppressed condition</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">is is some other term and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">co-opting of the term racism for this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">that is so very confusing it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">mean that the addition of the two</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">characteristics isn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">unique entity okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to get through a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">number of the rest of these um</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">fairly quickly what is the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">justification for allergies</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">given how many grasses and molds i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">allergic to it seems maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">yeah allergies are maladaptive a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:29.839" style="s2">them seems to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">stem from the so</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">the immune system makes different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">of antibodies antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">are immunoglobulins ig and there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">different classes of them and the ige</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">system seems to be triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">allergens but not</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">useful against pathogens which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">perplexing why would you have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">antibody system</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">that is reacting to things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">actually hostile to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">now there is strong evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">actually this system</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">was adaptive against things like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">worms and that the absence of worms in</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">modern life has left it idle</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">and that it is somehow responding to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">molecules</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">that it shouldn&#39;t be and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">absolutely correct allergies are in and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">maladaptive why we experience them has</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:21.760" style="s2">something to do with a mismatch between</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">us and our modern environment and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">mismatch may be</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">in whole or in part the absence of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.880" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">pathogen to which</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">those those antibodies are targeted</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">okay the next two are comments it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the action or token</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">which is shown by the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">made up on the spot it is a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">pure power which states we&#39;re now in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">control and there is nothing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">yeah so this to our discussion in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">last hour and that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">and a second comment from someone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">love and support you both and brett i</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">hope the unity project works out</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">eventually we will need it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">become clear to me that a firm hand is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">needed to deal with the bang of donkeys</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">trump has my vote we&#39;ve heard this from</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">yep yep</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">i think you should uh i think you should</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">cool criticism of people wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">some people feel safer with them on even</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">if they realize the lack of utility and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">don&#39;t judge others</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.440" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">it can help psychologically yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">this is right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m concerned that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">are increasingly going to be so</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">completely covered that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">going to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">any exposure to the sun at all this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">just obviously one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">drums i&#39;m banging lately but i do agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.720" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">i i would rather they not</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">look with fear and hostility at those of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">us who will not wear masks outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">when we understand when what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.839" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">believe to be true about the virus now</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">means that that keeps us safe and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.800" style="s2">we are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">um doing just fine without masks outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.800" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">uh but but i hear this yeah i feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.079" style="s2">slightly misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">i have no criticism if you want to wear</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.079" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">a mask outside and if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">you know you&#39;re taking an extra step</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">what i feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">is a i want to alert people that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">you know the fact is you could do</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">everything in your power</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">not to encounter any human beings you</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">also wear a full body hazmat</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">suit right there all sorts of things you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:24.480" style="s2">could do that you&#39;re not doing so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.480" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">drawing a line somewhere and my point</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">to people is a winter is coming as we</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">now is the moment to take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">the fact that you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">the daylight you have uv radiation</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">giving you double protection outside</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">and to the extent that you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">feel oppressed when winter arrives back</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">here in the northern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">this is a moment to drink in as much</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">contact direct contact with the outside</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">world as you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">so i you know if somebody feels safer</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">wearing the masks that&#39;s fine but i want</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">them to know that they have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">about where they&#39;re drawing the line and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">firmly believe you have an obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">wear your mask indoors to protect</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">others even if you don&#39;t believe it just</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">the chances that you&#39;re wrong are so</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">great you have that obligation but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">data itself tells us outside for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">moment at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">is quite safe and you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">standing talking to somebody maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">should put your mask up that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">but if you&#39;re just walking along the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">chances are minuscule and you might as</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">take the advantage of good weather</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">and reduce the level of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">opposite six months from now</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">yep this is another comment</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">soldiers are conditioned to not buckle</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">under pressure</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">interesting it has also been recommended</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">to me by dave who made the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">knife behind me</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">what should one do if they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">they&#39;re in a group with some wolves in</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">sheep&#39;s clothing</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">and some sheep i spared myself the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">struggle session and walked away does</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">that make me a coward</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">no but i would certainly if you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">identify who the sheep are and who the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">wolves are</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:23.599" style="s2">you might begin to create spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">are safe enough that you can explore</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.599" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">this with the sheep so that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">are at least aware enough that it will</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">free spaces</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">wolf free spaces yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re wrapping wfs yes um</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">wolf free spaces are uh very good for</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">sheep so anyway you might explore it</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">such that even if they can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:44.880" style="s2">right away at the point the wolves begin</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">to reveal themselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.880" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">they will think back to what you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">and potentially it will trigger</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">something that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">lodge something that can that can show</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:54.720" style="s2">back up in people&#39;s memory</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">are you familiar with the soviet</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.720" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">defector yuri besmanov the current</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">movement on the far left seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">closely following a strategy somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">similar to what he outlined for marx&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">takeovers of society</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">do you have thoughts yep i&#39;m familiar a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve done a little bit of listening</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">somebody recommended and i on a drive</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">somewhere was</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">listening to it um i get something from</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">it i&#39;m a little concerned that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:19.359" style="s2">exactly sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">enough what is being said in order to i</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.359" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">this is now showing up in uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">in dialogue about this strategy</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.799" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">but i&#39;d like to understand better what</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">it is people are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">at the moment i think the uh alignment</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">between it and what we are seeing is too</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">loose to actually have any</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">useful sense about it okay uh two more</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.440" style="s2">here and then we&#39;ll switch to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:48.799" style="s2">this hours super chat uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.440" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine and zinc combo is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.799" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">observational studies show it lowers</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">mortality and severity of covet</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">why not take it since there are no</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">downsides and there&#39;s a chance of upside</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:03.280" style="s2">so this question reads to me quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">different depending on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">i imagine that some people would argue</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">why not just take it to prophylactically</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">like a multivitamin and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">some people and and maybe that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">you mean here and maybe what you mean is</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">if you have cobia why not take it i</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:18.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s what i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">implication</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.720" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">i think so too um although i want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">address the first possibility first</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">which is um again the first possibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:29.079" style="s2">of what is being said here is why not</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">just take this sort of hydroc</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.079" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">zinc combo prophylactically um</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">since there are no downsides and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">a chance of upside uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what downsides there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.880" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">uh unless you actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">have covet 19 the fact that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">zinc</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">probably you&#39;re probably going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">hard time overdosing on zinc</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">but anything that you take in excess has</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:57:59.240" style="s2">a chance of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">affecting you badly and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.240" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">um yes originally it&#39;s um boy what</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember what botanical</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">chloroquine originally oh uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">corner from it&#39;s quite oh it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">tree uh i can&#39;t think what it is at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">yep that&#39;ll come to me uh or leaf</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">um but it&#39;s it&#39;s synthesized in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">with a whole bunch of other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">and uh you know for instance we know and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s at all what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">going on with hydroxychloroquine but</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">um one of the big health effects</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">of the opioid addiction uh in</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">in the us is that there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">other stuff that comes with the pills</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">that people are getting the opiates from</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">and so the fact that tylenol has been</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">um part of the opiates uh that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">are becoming addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:52.480" style="s2">and that tylenol has known liver</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">toxicity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.480" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">causes hearing loss and you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">these other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">means that some some by no means all and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">probably not the majority but a large</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">fraction</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:10.079" style="s2">of the the downstream health effects</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">of the opioid epidemic is because people</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.079" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">getting their opiates through pills that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">were produced with</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">other things in part as a measure to</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">reduce people&#39;s reliance on opiates</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a vicious circle</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">um that is causing problems</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">um because of the other things in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">pills so you know i don&#39;t know what else</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">is in the hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">or how it&#39;s synthesized or even just</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">what the effects of hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">long-term on a body are but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">talking about the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:39.440" style="s2">which is if you have covered 19 does</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">does this cocktail seem to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">low low risk it does especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">catch it early</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">um it seems like the later you are in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">the progression of the disease is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">less likely it is to do any good</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.240" end="00:59:56.319" style="s2">um we talked previously about a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">situation in which i</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.319" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">briefly thought i might have coveted it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">turned out i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:06.119" style="s2">um but at that time i certainly</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">was of the mindset if i wanted to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.119" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine could i i think the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">answer is it&#39;s actually difficult</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">in oregon to do so and that troubles me</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">because i do think</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">um as we&#39;ve tried to articulate</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:24.160" style="s2">covet is less deadly in the acute sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:27.280" style="s2">than we thought but it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.160" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">more destructive than we thought and so</p>

<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">several of the questions that came in</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">this hour to what extent would you say</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">you two espouse objectivism allah and</p>

<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">i would say not at all in the randian</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">sense but there is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve tried to lay this out a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">i think the the thing is society</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">should endeavor to deliver a fair</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">structure in which people can take</p>

<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">possible effect in other words you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.400" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">as much of this shunted over to personal</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">responsibility landscape as you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:09.680" style="s2">but a fair landscape in which people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.680" end="01:02:13.280" style="s2">functions best is desirable and so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:19.359" style="s2">um the problem with the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">ann randian view of the universe is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.359" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">focuses entirely on one side of a</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">and is very unsatisfying in that regard</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.680" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:32.839" style="s2">that said the world i want to see is one</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">in which personal responsibility works</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.839" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">yeah is neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:40.160" style="s2">mitochondrial dna no longer present in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">current humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.160" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">why did sapiens moms supported by</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">sapiens culture survive better than</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">neanderthal moms and were neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">moms never integrated into sapiens</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">oh wow um interesting i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve never i don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve never thought to ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">before and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">i have not i know that i have not seen</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">any papers that specifically mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">neanderthal mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:14.319" style="s2">um the the just super basic uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">genetic molecular biology underlying the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.319" end="01:03:19.359" style="s2">question is that mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">because it is in the egg and not in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.359" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">sperm</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">can be tracked entirely through the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.839" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">maternal line and so we would expect a</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:27.440" style="s2">senior to all</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">mitochondrial dna in any descendants of</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">of neanderthal females and if there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">no neanderthal females</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">in our descendants of course we know</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:41.039" style="s2">that europeans have a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">uh not a fair bit some neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.039" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">in us um does that mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">entirely from the mail line</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think so and i think this</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">actually treads very close to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">a question from our last live stream</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">that we ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">uh chased down to bedrock i thought yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right actually and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:07.520" style="s2">basically the idea is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">you you know you don&#39;t see it similarly</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.520" end="01:04:10.839" style="s2">no actually it&#39;s not going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">same so well and we should we should</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.839" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">clarify the question from last time was</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">about uh the y chromosome and do all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">male descendants of say genghis khan</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">have his y</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">chromosome no unless it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">uninterrupted male line</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">right right because the daughter of</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">um the daughter of genghis khan would</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">have two x chromosomes and her</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">son would still be a male descendant of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:36.079" style="s2">genghis khan but would not have his y</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:39.599" style="s2">chromosome</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.079" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">whereas the son son son son son of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.599" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">genghis</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.359" style="s2">khan would have his y chromosome because</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:46.720" style="s2">there was only one place one y</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.359" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">to be transferred compared to</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.720" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">um the egg is present</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">well it&#39;s okay maybe i think it may be</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">same so the son</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">of a neanderthal mother</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">no yeah the son of a neanderthal mother</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">could have a daughter who uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">would have a daughter who does not have</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">neanderthal mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">even though he is neanderthal well the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">son of a neanderthal mother who has a</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:22.960" style="s2">homo sapiens father</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">yep um actually that does that part</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">if he is mayor is he is having sex with</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">uh sapiens female then</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:36.559" style="s2">their son would or their daughter</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">my god their daughter would have sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.559" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">um so that explains</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">why we don&#39;t inherently that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">inherently mean that there are no</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">maternal maternal ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">in the neanderthal line but it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:58.319" style="s2">interesting isn&#39;t it that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:05:59.760" style="s2">at least i have not heard any mention of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.319" end="01:06:03.200" style="s2">mitochondrial</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.760" end="01:06:03.200" style="s2">dna from the neanderthal line</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">no i mean i think this i think this</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.119" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">seems straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">because uh a a tiny selective</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">advantage of sapiens mitochondria would</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">be expected in the scenario that we just</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:25.599" style="s2">painted why um because the point is</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">um that selective advantage</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:32.960" style="s2">what you have is a decoupling of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:35.400" style="s2">genomic dna from the mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.960" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">and a slight advantage of sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.400" end="01:06:39.119" style="s2">mitochondria</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">could account for the the total absence</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.119" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">mitochondrial winners that would behave</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">oh absolutely could i just ask you why</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">you expect a selective advantage</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t but the fact that you don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">these other mitochondria</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">all it takes the only assumption it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">takes is a is a tiny selective advantage</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">of sapience mitochondrial dna</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:57.200" style="s2">right over neanderthal so i was just</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">asking you what what you think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.200" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">might be but it actually isn&#39;t necessary</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:00.960" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:03.599" style="s2">just proof of concept that something</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.960" end="01:07:06.880" style="s2">simple could result in this i also think</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.599" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">that a just a simple law</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.880" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">of large numbers issue could be</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">sufficient in this case</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">that um the question of an</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">unbroken female line</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:24.880" style="s2">um might be very unlikely um</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.599" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">and so you know i could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">hybrid advantage to sapiens neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">hybrids that would account for certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.680" style="s2">bits of genome being transmitted through</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:37.520" style="s2">time yeah i can imagine a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.680" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">neutral comparison between the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.520" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">mitochondria of</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">neanderthals and sapiens resulting in</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:47.200" style="s2">the loss of the neanderthal dna for no</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:49.039" style="s2">selective reason</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.200" end="01:07:50.480" style="s2">just because it would have been small in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.039" end="01:07:52.640" style="s2">percentage and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.480" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">i could also imagine a small advantage</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.640" end="01:07:55.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">mitochondrial dna from sapiens driving</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.920" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">out yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">the other so um i guess the point is i</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think this is all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">surprising because there are multiple</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.520" end="01:08:06.640" style="s2">routes that you would get there</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:07.280" style="s2">okay uh next question we&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.640" end="01:08:09.039" style="s2">few more</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.280" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">and go over a little bit since we took a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.039" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">long time on the early questions</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:16.239" style="s2">uh we have 21 plus senses ryan argues</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.559" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">but only test if the main five are</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.239" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">calibrated properly could some people be</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">sensing reality in dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:22.839" style="s2">different ways than others</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.199" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">what are the adaptive advantages and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">trade-offs well i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">i&#39;d love to see the reference on 21 plus</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">senses</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:33.679" style="s2">but certainly uh we have uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">we have more than the five that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.679" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">usually talked about</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">um including several different you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">basically touch needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">um dis dis</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.560" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">disaggregated disaggregated into several</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:48.569" style="s2">into pressure</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">into temperature into um</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.569" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">at least one more i can&#39;t quite movement</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">and pain yeah and um and you know there</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:00.960" style="s2">and there are senses</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.120" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">that we don&#39;t seem to have but other</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.960" end="01:09:04.000" style="s2">organisms do and so is it possible that</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:07.640" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.000" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">any latent uh for instance</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.640" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">magnetoreception or electroreception</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:16.239" style="s2">or foam or nasal sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.000" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">what you see when you know when when a</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.239" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">horse or your cat</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:21.679" style="s2">seems to smell something on the wind but</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">opens their mouth a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.679" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s not actually smelling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:26.880" style="s2">sort of a it&#39;s a chemical sense like</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:29.040" style="s2">smell and taste but it&#39;s taking in</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.880" end="01:09:29.679" style="s2">larger odorant molecules than smell can</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.040" end="01:09:32.159" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.679" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">can can assess and supposedly our</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.159" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">vomeronasal organ is</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">is turned off it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:38.239" style="s2">hooked up um but</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a question so you know there</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.239" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">are definitely other senses that we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">that that are possible and there are</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">ways to disaggregate the senses that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:46.719" style="s2">do know we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">in ways that might be more useful even</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.719" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">like you know vision you know color</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">vision versus black and white</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:55.440" style="s2">lines versus pattern these are all um</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">you know interesting and useful ways i</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.440" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">think to actually talk about the senses</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:01.600" style="s2">one jacobson&#39;s organ which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">vomeronasal organ</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.600" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">in people uh i believe it passes the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.040" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">adaptive test</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.159" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">if it was rapidly shrinking that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">be a different question but if it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">persistent</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:13.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it is size then it passes</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:14.640" style="s2">the adaptive test and that means that</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.360" end="01:10:15.840" style="s2">like the appendix we will likely</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">discover that it is hooked up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.840" end="01:10:18.080" style="s2">something or is another some other way</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.080" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">let&#39;s just um let me just add a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">bit in there i actually don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">the size of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:26.880" style="s2">in or maybe i never knew in all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">other primates</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.880" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">but one thing we see with the origin of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">primates so</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:33.840" style="s2">mammals our mammal history has a strong</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.840" end="01:10:36.960" style="s2">towards smell as one of the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">senses</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.960" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">that is going on in mammals and we see</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">the primitively</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">smell part of the brain becomes actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:45.600" style="s2">the cerebral cortex</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:47.199" style="s2">in in us and so that&#39;s the part that</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.600" end="01:10:49.840" style="s2">gets really big and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.199" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">and so you have you know well over 100</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.840" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">million years</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">maybe over well over 200 million years</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.719" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">of um basically smell</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:58.400" style="s2">forward evolution in mammals and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:11:00.800" style="s2">you get to</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.400" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">the origin of primates and smell begins</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.800" end="01:11:04.320" style="s2">to take a backseat to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">vision and you see basically the you</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.320" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">know the visual cortex is getting bigger</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:10.719" style="s2">you have eyes</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.440" end="01:11:11.679" style="s2">um moving from you know more more on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.719" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">side of the head to</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.679" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">more more binoculars so that you can end</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:19.199" style="s2">up getting uh depth of field</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">and um you know the bigger relative</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.199" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">to the face so primates in general are</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:27.280" style="s2">becoming more vision focused</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">but it has been a sort of a pat answer</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:30.480" style="s2">of course and i&#39;m not telling you</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">anything that you don&#39;t know um but</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.480" end="01:11:33.600" style="s2">there&#39;s been a pat ads that well like oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">well premise just don&#39;t smell well</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.600" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">and of course we are we are a primate</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.679" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">and we smell even less well than</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:41.760" style="s2">everyone else because we are so</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:43.120" style="s2">vision driven and that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.760" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">actually how it works right</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.120" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that wrong primates don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">smell good and this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">a misapprehension especially yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.600" end="01:11:54.159" style="s2">well um you are about to tell me</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">that i don&#39;t know i hope okay um how</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">far back is the vomeronasal organ</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:06.840" style="s2">supposedly unhooked</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">oh so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know uh i</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.840" end="01:12:12.080" style="s2">my right so</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.080" style="s2">are there i&#39;m trying to i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.080" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">think as i&#39;m just filling space with</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.080" end="01:12:19.120" style="s2">words here are there any</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:22.400" style="s2">primates that was the dog</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">not me thinking um are there any primate</p>

<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:32.239" style="s2">i can&#39;t think of any so what that says</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:35.600" style="s2">then is that this is a slam</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.239" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">dunk that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.600" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">or at least has until very recently in</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:41.280" style="s2">our line because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">many millions of years of it persisting</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.280" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">with no value which makes no sense of</p>

<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">so take that as a challenge um here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:50.800" style="s2">the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:52.480" style="s2">what happened you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.800" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">vomeronasal organs this was the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.480" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">perfect opportunity for you to invoke</p>

<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">i&#39;m done okay well final thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">21 senses i&#39;m not sure what that refers</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:11.120" style="s2">to i&#39;d love to know i know that there</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">are 16 different kinds of awesome and i</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:15.040" style="s2">imagine that there would be a sense for</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">each of them 21 though seems a stretch</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.040" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">but i&#39;d love to know</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:20.080" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s 16 kinds of awesome plus</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:21.840" style="s2">the five uh 16 other kinds of senses</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.080" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">plus the main five senses that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.840" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">named here so</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:27.280" style="s2">16 plus five there you go you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">one two three four five senses working</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.280" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">overtime and with that we&#39;ll move on to</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">the next question we will</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">in one of oh this is from bill maher</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">apparently um</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">wow in one of uh in one of jordan</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">peterson&#39;s lectures</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">he lists off careers and the iq needed</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">to succeed in those fields</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.320" end="01:13:50.480" style="s2">i find this discouraging can a person</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:51.120" style="s2">with an average iq succeed in complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.480" end="01:13:52.880" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.120" end="01:13:55.520" style="s2">can hard work compensate for being</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:57.360" style="s2">average thank you</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.520" end="01:13:58.560" style="s2">um i&#39;d like to see i&#39;d like to see that</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.360" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">lecture i&#39;ll bet he does</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.560" end="01:14:01.760" style="s2">a more nuanced i bet he has a more</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:05.920" style="s2">nuanced take than that suggests</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.760" end="01:14:08.960" style="s2">yep um people take iq</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.920" end="01:14:12.159" style="s2">to mean heritable and they take</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.960" end="01:14:13.760" style="s2">heritable to mean hardwired by the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.159" end="01:14:15.199" style="s2">genome and it doesn&#39;t mean these things</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.760" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.199" end="01:14:21.360" style="s2">expose your kids to stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">that enhances their ability to calculate</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.360" end="01:14:24.159" style="s2">right i don&#39;t mean calculating the</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:25.840" style="s2">narrow mathematical sense though that</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.159" end="01:14:29.040" style="s2">stuff is quite good</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.840" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">but the basic point is iq</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">is amenable to intervention as much as</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">the literature</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">cast doubt on that in some context but</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:38.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.520" end="01:14:40.960" style="s2">i just don&#39;t think this means what we</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.800" end="01:14:42.239" style="s2">think it means are there ways to</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.960" end="01:14:44.080" style="s2">compensate</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.239" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">yes the earlier the intervention the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.080" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">more likely it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:49.840" style="s2">to succeed um and the question really is</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:52.960" style="s2">can you find</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.840" end="01:14:56.440" style="s2">puzzles that exercise the relevant</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.960" end="01:14:59.679" style="s2">circuitry in a useful and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.440" end="01:14:59.679" style="s2">self-augmenting way</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:07.440" style="s2">okay good if conscience</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.920" end="01:15:09.440" style="s2">is an adaptation does that mean that our</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.440" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">life choices that go against our evolved</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:13.600" style="s2">nature even detrimentally are as well</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.760" end="01:15:15.520" style="s2">for instance modern diets and excessive</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.600" end="01:15:16.239" style="s2">internet use i don&#39;t get this question</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.520" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">yet do you</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.239" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">not not quite i think um</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:23.679" style="s2">i think basically if you have i think</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:26.239" style="s2">the question is</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.679" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">if the ability to make choice is an</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.239" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">adaptation does that mean that every</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">choice that you make is therefore</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:32.960" style="s2">adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">and and no the answer is is no</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.960" end="01:15:37.199" style="s2">well the i think the this surface is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:39.280" style="s2">really important</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:41.199" style="s2">thing though which is that you can have</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.280" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">two adaptations</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.199" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">in opposition this this is the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:46.080" style="s2">thing oh this is also true</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re talking about with uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">foreskin and circumcision</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:52.320" style="s2">yeah right foreskin is a is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">morphological adaptation circumcision is</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.320" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">a cultural adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.840" end="01:15:57.600" style="s2">presumably they are responsive to</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">different environments in which</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.600" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">top values are reflected</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:09.600" style="s2">so what the person is getting at</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.520" end="01:16:11.199" style="s2">is basically and you should frequently</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:14.800" style="s2">expect this to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.199" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">the hierarchy that a cultural mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.800" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">will interrupt a deeper adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:21.920" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:23.679" style="s2">right so forbidding yourself access to</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.920" end="01:16:27.120" style="s2">something for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.679" end="01:16:32.239" style="s2">is two things in opposition and i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.120" end="01:16:32.239" style="s2">if i&#39;m reading the question yes um</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.840" end="01:16:36.719" style="s2">modern-day</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:39.280" style="s2">life choices that go against our evolved</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:42.800" style="s2">nature as well</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.280" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">yes totally um if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.800" end="01:16:47.360" style="s2">are prone to seek sugar because sugar</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">was so scarce in your ancestral</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.360" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">environment that</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:52.000" style="s2">you were in no danger of toxifying</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:53.280" style="s2">yourself with it and any amount you</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.000" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">could get was a win</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.280" end="01:16:56.880" style="s2">and now you&#39;re forbidding yourself sugar</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:16:58.560" style="s2">because you&#39;re making yourself sick or</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.880" end="01:17:01.520" style="s2">fat with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:02.640" style="s2">that is your ability to detect a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.520" end="01:17:05.600" style="s2">which is adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.640" end="01:17:06.000" style="s2">overriding and more basic pattern which</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.600" end="01:17:07.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.000" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">but the metal level might be adapted but</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.920" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that all the choices</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">no no there&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.120" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">this is all in there does that mean that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:19.040" style="s2">our life choices that go against our</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:21.440" style="s2">evolved nature are as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.040" end="01:17:22.640" style="s2">okay then the ambiguities in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.440" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">the problem is if you say all</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.679" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">then the answer is no if you say</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:34.239" style="s2">some then the answer is many are but not</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:34.239" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">the woke youtube channel was useful last</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">night in wisconsin</p>

<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:18:00.400" style="s2">no way we are going to get out of this</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.560" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">if we don&#39;t find some way to arrest that</p>

<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">metaphorical although we know that there</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.000" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">are actually some flat earthers out</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:30.159" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">um no no i think this is literal</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.159" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s more important in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">moment to answer this as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:38.159" style="s2">uh uh metaphorical but you want you want</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:41.440" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.159" end="01:18:44.400" style="s2">literally if it&#39;s literal then</p>

<p begin="01:18:48.480" end="01:18:53.679" style="s2">difficult yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:56.320" style="s2">um so what is it</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.679" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">what do you think we&#39;re being asked</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.320" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:02.800" style="s2">asked about uh the</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.159" end="01:19:03.280" style="s2">the creeping ideology that is taking</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:05.520" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.280" end="01:19:06.880" style="s2">about that i mean i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.520" end="01:19:09.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have exactly put it</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.880" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">in flat earther terms but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.920" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s everything we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s these people who have</p>

<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:21.679" style="s2">the woke thinking</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.679" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">in which case you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:26.159" style="s2">about this you know it&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.159" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">game theory and the fear of being</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">stigmatized that drives people and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to be very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:34.880" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.960" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">enough safety that people can actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.880" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">see it i guess maybe i would ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:40.560" style="s2">if this is really about that woke</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:44.320" style="s2">ideology i would ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.560" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">um to hear what system it is that they</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.320" end="01:19:46.960" style="s2">envision</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">and how is it going to function because</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.960" end="01:19:49.440" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t seem to answer any of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:50.800" style="s2">those questions</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.440" end="01:19:53.120" style="s2">you know actually it might if this</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.800" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">really is a flat earther um like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.120" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">never met one in real life as far as i</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:19:58.640" style="s2">it&#39;s that it strikes me as a unicornish</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:02.159" style="s2">it might be i mean it&#39;s your workplace</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.719" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">and so you have to be careful but it</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.159" end="01:20:06.239" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:09.360" style="s2">really useful to try to develop tools</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.239" end="01:20:13.120" style="s2">that could also be deployed against</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.360" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">the the kind of woke mob but because</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.120" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">in the case of flat earth there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:20.800" style="s2">you&#39;re simply right and he&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.840" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">wrong and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.800" end="01:20:24.800" style="s2">there&#39;s just no end of evidence in</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.600" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">support of your position</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.800" end="01:20:28.239" style="s2">and no end of evidence against his i</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.679" end="01:20:31.360" style="s2">presume</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.239" end="01:20:32.960" style="s2">maybe wrong maybe it&#39;s a her um so it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.360" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">seems like you could</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">consider all the evidence and you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">try just</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:42.880" style="s2">try in a number of different ways to</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.360" end="01:20:43.760" style="s2">en engage you know engage your</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.880" end="01:20:45.840" style="s2">co-workers</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.760" end="01:20:47.360" style="s2">you know see if you see if you put a</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.840" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">good piece of evidence in the heads of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.360" end="01:20:50.960" style="s2">couple of your co-workers if it comes</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">back to you through someone else&#39;s mouth</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.960" end="01:20:55.280" style="s2">um you know it seems like an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:57.679" style="s2">way to see</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.280" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">how such thinking can spread and how you</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.679" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">might arrest it</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">in what is in one way as high stakes as</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.840" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">it gets because someone who actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:06.400" style="s2">believes that the earth is flat</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:07.840" style="s2">can presumably not be reasoned with on</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.400" end="01:21:09.520" style="s2">any number of subjects</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.840" end="01:21:11.199" style="s2">but another way the stakes are</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.520" end="01:21:12.880" style="s2">incredibly low because what actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.199" end="01:21:15.280" style="s2">does a totally ludicrous belief in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.880" end="01:21:16.400" style="s2">flat earth how will that manifest in</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">such a way that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.400" end="01:21:20.080" style="s2">anyone is less safe as a result of you</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:23.600" style="s2">know sharing a</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.080" end="01:21:26.000" style="s2">refrigerator with them all right</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.600" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">okay do you have thoughts about the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.000" end="01:21:28.239" style="s2">unfortunate connotations of light as</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.840" end="01:21:30.239" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.239" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">and dark as evil see for instance</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.239" end="01:21:34.800" style="s2">biden&#39;s dnc speech</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">as misapplied to skin color what other</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.800" end="01:21:38.880" style="s2">simplistic associations have we not</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">shaken off evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.880" end="01:21:42.880" style="s2">yeah my thought is we all need to just</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">grow up</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.880" end="01:21:46.560" style="s2">and that you can go around policing</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.440" end="01:21:50.320" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.560" end="01:21:54.080" style="s2">little things but i don&#39;t see that as</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.320" end="01:21:55.760" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not significant</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.080" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s significant if you imbue it</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.760" end="01:22:01.760" style="s2">with power yeah even if it has a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:02.400" style="s2">racist history if we all just understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.760" end="01:22:05.440" style="s2">that this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.400" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like gender in</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.440" end="01:22:08.719" style="s2">romance languages the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">table is female</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.719" end="01:22:13.600" style="s2">is really not troubling yeah right you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:15.679" style="s2">could take it as troubling but it just</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.600" end="01:22:17.199" style="s2">isn&#39;t and you know see my earlier</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.679" end="01:22:19.199" style="s2">comment about</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.199" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">the origin of primates which is probably</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.199" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">more than 100 million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:26.320" style="s2">saw our ancestors moving towards a</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:29.600" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.320" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">vision forward life and</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.600" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">that meant becoming less nocturnal and</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:36.639" style="s2">more diurnal and relying on</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">photons and being able to see things</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.639" end="01:22:40.400" style="s2">literally and of course</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:41.840" style="s2">our english like every language is</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.400" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">filled with metaphor and most of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.840" end="01:22:45.360" style="s2">metaphors are actually hiding</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2">um like almost every sentence that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.360" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">use even ones that we think are very</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.880" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">very straightforward are filled with</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:52.159" style="s2">metaphor and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:53.920" style="s2">of course we have come to associate</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.159" end="01:22:56.719" style="s2">light with goodness and</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.920" end="01:22:58.480" style="s2">dark with with places where things can</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.719" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">hide because literally things can hide</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.480" end="01:23:04.080" style="s2">when you cannot see them</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:07.280" style="s2">the unfortunate coincidence</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.080" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">that the group of people who have been</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.280" end="01:23:10.719" style="s2">most frequently uh who have most</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:13.120" style="s2">frequently suffered</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.719" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">uh racism have darker skin than those</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.120" end="01:23:19.040" style="s2">who have most frequently been the ones</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:21.440" style="s2">enforcing that racism is actually just</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.040" end="01:23:22.239" style="s2">a coincidence it&#39;s just not related in</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.440" end="01:23:24.480" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.239" end="01:23:25.600" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s just nothing there</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.480" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">that makes that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.600" end="01:23:29.679" style="s2">a correlation and so we have all these</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:31.440" style="s2">metaphors in the english language as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.679" end="01:23:34.719" style="s2">result of us being diurnal</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.440" end="01:23:38.320" style="s2">and and and vision um focused</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:40.320" style="s2">and then we also have melanin as an</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.320" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">adaptation to living near the equator</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.320" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">and add to that as sort of a guns germs</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:47.760" style="s2">and steel style argument around</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:50.960" style="s2">which peoples uh were most likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.760" end="01:23:51.760" style="s2">taken advantage of and it&#39;s just not the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:55.360" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.760" end="01:23:56.719" style="s2">and so yeah you can map those on</p>
