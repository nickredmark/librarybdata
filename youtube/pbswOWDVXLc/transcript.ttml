<p begin="00:00:07.820" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve been interested for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">in the IDW Jordan Pederson and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">feels like a kind of great intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">awakening so far it&#39;s been a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">countercultural phenomenon and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">people are kind of described it as being</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">on the right or being against the left</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">doing is kind of unpicking what the left</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">has to learn from the IDW movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:37.079" style="s2">itself whether you kind of agree with</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">them politically or whatever if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">watch some of these some of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">programs are there at Weinstein Bret</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">Weinstein Jordan Peterson Ben Shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">you realize that they are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:50.039" style="s2">very fundamental things very important</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.120" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">fundamental things there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.039" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">awareness of the challenges that we face</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">as a society so it seems the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">to do is to try and understand that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:04.489" style="s2">be part of that conversation and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">just say a part of what drew me into</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.489" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">listening more and more to these folks</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">is like being challenged and then saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">wow but they&#39;re also really smart</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">they&#39;re doing their conversations as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">said slowing conversations down instead</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">of five minutes sound bytes on legacy</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">media you know media forms which are so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">simplifying and reductionistic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">allowing people to sit and think out</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">loud together in long-form ways and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">tease apart really complex ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">they&#39;re also able to touch on really</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">hot-button issues that have kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">off limits in certain ways especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">when you set them at the left the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">have certain topics and issues and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">you don&#39;t tow the line you can easily be</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">exiled or if nothing else questioned and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">frowned upon but they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">touch on some of these and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">what you want about many of them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">obviously I don&#39;t agree with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">things a lot of them say but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">modeling how to have conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">talk about things and they&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">people and even if you disagree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:12.599" style="s2">really refreshing to have real discourse</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:14.939" style="s2">and intellectual people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.599" end="00:02:16.499" style="s2">really important issues and I will say I</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.939" end="00:02:18.599" style="s2">mean I think you&#39;re right and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.499" end="00:02:20.999" style="s2">said this before around compared with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.599" end="00:02:23.099" style="s2">the right and the complete control over</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.999" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">the government the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.099" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">jail cells and guns and elite police and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:31.889" style="s2">military the left has more soft power</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:34.409" style="s2">it&#39;s more in the academia and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.889" end="00:02:38.129" style="s2">universities also Hollywood and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.409" end="00:02:40.430" style="s2">you know forms I will say when I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.129" end="00:02:43.769" style="s2">first encountering Peterson and Ike</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.430" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">challenged but then intrigued by some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.769" end="00:02:47.219" style="s2">his critiques to the left and then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.209" style="s2">came talked about this that slide into</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.219" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">you know Soviet Union and and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.209" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">genocide and you know gulag but then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:58.949" style="s2">was also hearing about Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">at Evergreen and I was really curious so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.949" end="00:03:04.469" style="s2">when I finally watched that live raw</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">footage of what happened to Evergreen it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.469" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">was really shocking and it was like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:11.219" style="s2">just didn&#39;t expect to see that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">young people people of color and white</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.219" end="00:03:15.629" style="s2">allies fighting for racial justice and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:18.509" style="s2">diversity inequity doing this mob</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">mentality of a white man who was a white</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.509" end="00:03:23.189" style="s2">man but who&#39;s also a Bernie supporter</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:25.799" style="s2">and Occupy Wall Street guy solidly on</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.189" end="00:03:29.579" style="s2">the Left solidly and Ally and to watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.799" end="00:03:31.799" style="s2">just how that unfolded and it ends by</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.579" end="00:03:35.009" style="s2">them wandering the the campus with</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.799" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">baseball bats and disarming the police</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.009" end="00:03:39.439" style="s2">and of course the president of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">college did not help with that situation</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.439" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">it brought up that question of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:46.680" style="s2">not a gonna be this totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:49.139" style="s2">takeover but it&#39;s also not completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:51.090" style="s2">benign if if you if you imagine people</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.139" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">gaining more power with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:56.069" style="s2">fanatic chaotic mob mentality which you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.169" style="s2">know people are implications critique</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.069" end="00:03:59.729" style="s2">which I still grapple with is I think he</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.169" end="00:04:01.620" style="s2">quotes Orson Welles or someone saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.729" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">the bourgeoisie it&#39;s not so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.620" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">driven so much by love for the poor as</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">much as by hatred and envy of the rich</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:11.129" style="s2">and that&#39;s really touchy and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.669" end="00:04:12.449" style="s2">fine line but I hear naming that when</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.129" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">sometimes when I see it playing out</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.449" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">folks on the Left I&#39;m like doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">this open-hearted compassionate focus on</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:21.659" style="s2">the poor it side there&#39;s a lot of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">a shadow and there&#39;s a need for direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.659" end="00:04:24.979" style="s2">action and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:26.629" style="s2">to vism that disrupt systems but a point</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.979" end="00:04:28.729" style="s2">that Bret Weinstein makes is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.629" end="00:04:30.349" style="s2">universities are not the right target to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.729" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">be channeling all that energy channel</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.349" end="00:04:35.270" style="s2">that into organizing to vote out you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">know Republicans in Congress or channel</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.270" end="00:04:40.819" style="s2">that into you know protesting police</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">brutality and police violence like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.819" end="00:04:46.550" style="s2">university is is this really safe</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">protected area that does already value</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.550" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">these things yeah and is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">progressive than society at large why</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">are you wasting energy well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:56.150" style="s2">paradox I think because it&#39;s a soft</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">target right you can have wins yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.150" end="00:05:00.349" style="s2">if you if you target your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.150" style="s2">accusations of bigotry at progressive</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.349" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">people they will take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.150" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">oh my god and I&#39;m sorry am I am I is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:08.689" style="s2">there a microaggression here I&#39;m and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">where is the people on the right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.689" end="00:05:13.460" style="s2">well won&#39;t listens much right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:17.689" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s yeah it is the soft</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.460" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">targets in some in some sense but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.689" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">you mentioned the intellectual diet web</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:23.990" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:26.330" style="s2">going on there&#39;s there&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.990" end="00:05:27.259" style="s2">the the views of the people within it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.330" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">and there&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.259" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">conversation and I think that is why you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:33.560" style="s2">also talked about it is a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">enlivening experience and I had the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.560" end="00:05:37.969" style="s2">experience watching some of the Dave</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.539" end="00:05:40.779" style="s2">Rubin shows with my the Weinsteins and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.969" end="00:05:43.849" style="s2">Peterson Shapiro there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.779" end="00:05:45.319" style="s2">intellectual adventure yes in these</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.849" end="00:05:47.029" style="s2">conversations and I think on the Joe</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.319" end="00:05:50.149" style="s2">Rogan show as well there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.029" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what thinking looks like and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.149" end="00:05:53.899" style="s2">think we&#39;ve been starved of actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:56.990" style="s2">seeing people thinking yes and I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.899" end="00:05:59.539" style="s2">say another piece of it was that I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.990" end="00:06:02.750" style="s2">never really engaged to be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.539" end="00:06:05.180" style="s2">honest and listened with real integrity</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.750" end="00:06:07.370" style="s2">and openness to conservative thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.180" end="00:06:09.580" style="s2">people on the right I&#39;ve been I was so</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.370" end="00:06:12.710" style="s2">in the left bubble that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.580" end="00:06:14.509" style="s2">legitimately my my belief was we on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.710" end="00:06:15.979" style="s2">left are just right which is right about</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.509" end="00:06:17.899" style="s2">everything so we just need to like wait</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.979" end="00:06:19.250" style="s2">for the people on the right to wake up</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.899" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">and realize this there are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.250" end="00:06:23.960" style="s2">completely off yeah there&#39;s stupid or</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.610" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">evil or something can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.960" end="00:06:27.800" style="s2">understand why they are ever they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:29.300" style="s2">and so engaging and watching some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.800" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">these conversations in the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.300" end="00:06:35.229" style="s2">dark web has really helped drive home</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">this perspective which was new to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.229" end="00:06:38.570" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the Conservatives in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.570" end="00:06:42.920" style="s2">right or our right are correct but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:45.350" style="s2">like we on the Left we need the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.920" end="00:06:48.140" style="s2">Conservatives for that dialectic we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.350" end="00:06:50.900" style="s2">to think together to come to new truths</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.140" end="00:06:53.750" style="s2">and if you cut out one side of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.900" end="00:06:57.890" style="s2">that&#39;s inherently problematic and so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.750" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">get the idea of like we need diversity</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.890" end="00:07:01.850" style="s2">of viewpoints if we&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">inclusivity and diversity and inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.850" end="00:07:07.370" style="s2">we need to be inclusive of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.910" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">political you know beliefs different</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:11.660" style="s2">viewpoints and I think on the left that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:13.669" style="s2">can be it can be really dried you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.660" end="00:07:15.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t have that which is the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.669" end="00:07:16.570" style="s2">of the left the obsession with diversity</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.110" end="00:07:20.419" style="s2">but diversity within a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.570" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">ideologically kind of narrow yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.419" end="00:07:23.750" style="s2">you have some folks having really</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.650" end="00:07:26.870" style="s2">interesting conversations that go into</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.750" end="00:07:29.750" style="s2">taboo spaces were on the left you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.870" end="00:07:32.690" style="s2">go if you bring those up it&#39;s really you</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:34.760" style="s2">become a lightning rod and there&#39;s folks</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.690" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">here who are you know and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.760" end="00:07:37.430" style="s2">Peterson or someone was speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and they said</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.430" end="00:07:42.290" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna argue and disagree I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:44.030" style="s2">to hear the best argument for that like</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.290" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to set up straw man you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.030" end="00:07:48.440" style="s2">know and bad arguments you can dunk on</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">and you want to find people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.440" end="00:07:51.890" style="s2">really intelligent and articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:53.570" style="s2">can give you the best argument for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.890" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">if you&#39;re pro-life what&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.570" end="00:07:57.740" style="s2">argument for your belief in that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:07:59.540" style="s2">like let&#39;s at least engage on on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.740" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">higher level of intellectual discourse</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.540" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">yeah and you know this issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:06.229" style="s2">complexity of the world and of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:11.830" style="s2">society that we live in right now has</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.229" end="00:08:14.180" style="s2">come up and I have found in talking to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.830" end="00:08:17.210" style="s2">friends of mine who are into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.180" end="00:08:18.890" style="s2">intellectual dark will have been also</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.210" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">have a background in complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.890" end="00:08:22.580" style="s2">of a friend of mine who I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">arguing with over politics for a decade</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.580" end="00:08:26.810" style="s2">now he&#39;s always pointing out to me that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:30.229" style="s2">you know universal health care for</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.810" end="00:08:32.390" style="s2">example other societies have instituted</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.229" end="00:08:34.700" style="s2">this decades ago and their systems are</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.390" end="00:08:36.830" style="s2">not perfect but maybe better than what</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.700" end="00:08:40.219" style="s2">we have in the United States but given</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.830" end="00:08:43.270" style="s2">our unique cultural situation or unique</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.219" end="00:08:45.110" style="s2">history it&#39;s not a simple matter to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.270" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">transition from what we have now to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.110" end="00:08:48.830" style="s2">something else and we don&#39;t because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:50.210" style="s2">the complexity of the issue we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.830" end="00:08:52.190" style="s2">know what could go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.210" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">in that transition you could end up</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.190" end="00:08:57.860" style="s2">worse than we are right and so it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">me thinking okay maybe we need to move</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.860" end="00:09:01.550" style="s2">more slowly here I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">everyone should have health care as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.550" end="00:09:07.910" style="s2">right that&#39;s my value proposition but</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:09.230" style="s2">how do we get there I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.910" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">insurance companies are gonna be much</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.230" end="00:09:13.459" style="s2">help but it&#39;s like we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:17.209" style="s2">allies here and and create a system that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.459" end="00:09:19.459" style="s2">won&#39;t lead to a collapse which wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.209" end="00:09:21.140" style="s2">predicted because the value can guide</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.459" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">you to the end but the mean still</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.140" end="00:09:28.550" style="s2">remains to be discovered I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:32.570" style="s2">that back to that point the first stage</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.550" end="00:09:33.860" style="s2">for me has to be getting learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">be nonreactive</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.860" end="00:09:37.339" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s interesting that we both</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">can teach meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.339" end="00:09:41.990" style="s2">know and practice like that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:44.779" style="s2">effectively the practice it&#39;s being able</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.990" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">to yourself is the observer and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.779" end="00:09:49.010" style="s2">content being observed having that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.580" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">distance between I think without that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.010" end="00:09:53.899" style="s2">ability it&#39;s almost impossible to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:55.640" style="s2">the conversation because we know from</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.899" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">strong evidence from neuroscience that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.640" end="00:09:59.870" style="s2">we make decisions emotionally first and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:03.020" style="s2">then post rationalize them second later</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.870" end="00:10:05.510" style="s2">so with that in mind it&#39;s no surprise to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.020" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">me that until now there&#39;s been just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.510" end="00:10:10.580" style="s2">deep polarization and I think I see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">in the intellectual dark web I see a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.580" end="00:10:14.839" style="s2">level of non reactivity with mmm I kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:16.279" style="s2">of just disagree with that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.839" end="00:10:18.920" style="s2">disagreeing with each other but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.279" end="00:10:20.770" style="s2">having a generative conversation I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.920" end="00:10:23.779" style="s2">that&#39;s where some of the power lies of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.770" end="00:10:26.270" style="s2">spreading that apps assigning like hey</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.779" end="00:10:31.100" style="s2">let&#39;s have a conversation where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.270" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">not just in a reactive loop mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">it is about having a position as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">and coming back to your point about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:40.430" style="s2">politics something I heard Brett and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:41.570" style="s2">Eric talk about was we know that none of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.430" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">the solutions work</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.570" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">we know that libertarianism doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">for game theoretic reasons we know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:48.290" style="s2">capitalism doesn&#39;t work for game</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:50.540" style="s2">theoretic reasons we know that socialism</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.290" end="00:10:52.339" style="s2">won&#39;t work for game theoretic reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:54.680" style="s2">know all of these sort of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.339" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t work so let&#39;s we have a blank</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.680" end="00:10:59.329" style="s2">slate we have all we have a yeah we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.089" style="s2">we have to work with our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.329" end="00:11:03.829" style="s2">toolkit because we know these this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.089" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been given and work within</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.829" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">that so that&#39;s a that&#39;s also a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:10.339" style="s2">really interesting place to start this</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:12.019" style="s2">conversation from as well which I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.339" end="00:11:13.250" style="s2">most of the people within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.019" end="00:11:15.370" style="s2">intellectual dark web would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.250" end="00:11:17.899" style="s2">certainly from a political perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.370" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">we&#39;re starting from zero because we know</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.899" end="00:11:20.870" style="s2">none of the solutions are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">us through right right</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.870" end="00:11:24.139" style="s2">and yet we also have to start where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.790" style="s2">are unless there&#39;s gonna be a complete</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.139" end="00:11:27.740" style="s2">collapse and sometimes you need the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.790" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">blank slate before you can build</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.740" end="00:11:31.879" style="s2">something new I&#39;m not sure if we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:33.800" style="s2">be inviting that or at all it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.879" end="00:11:37.430" style="s2">excited about that you know that could</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.800" end="00:11:40.069" style="s2">be this situation afternoon but you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.430" end="00:11:43.339" style="s2">I really like to think about this in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.069" end="00:11:45.019" style="s2">terms of media technologies the</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.470" end="00:18:34.010" style="s2">and it seems that whoever he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.510" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">interested in and he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.010" end="00:18:38.180" style="s2">agree with them on anything just to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:42.590" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.180" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">refreshing and this seems important yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:48.500" style="s2">and I think the other thing with Joe</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:50.270" style="s2">Rogan is because you would never think</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.500" end="00:18:52.430" style="s2">of Joe Rogan as an intellectual in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">same way that say Brett Weinstein or</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.430" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">Eric Weinstein is but he is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:58.610" style="s2">intellectual dark word because of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:01.670" style="s2">nature of the kind of conversations he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.610" end="00:19:03.920" style="s2">able to host that he he&#39;s genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.670" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">interested he&#39;s genuinely learning and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.920" end="00:19:09.910" style="s2">he&#39;s genuinely inquiring and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:12.440" style="s2">that expand the conversation beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.910" end="00:19:14.600" style="s2">academia or those who identifies</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.440" end="00:19:16.460" style="s2">intellectuals and it and it Flags up how</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.600" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">and this is something Jordan green halls</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.460" end="00:19:21.230" style="s2">talked about as well is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:23.320" style="s2">because of the increased complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.230" end="00:19:25.850" style="s2">the world and the chaotic nature of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.320" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">existing in it we&#39;ve increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.850" end="00:19:32.570" style="s2">replaced thinking with a facsimile of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:34.580" style="s2">thinking reactivity responses and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.570" end="00:19:36.230" style="s2">this is again flagging up is oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.580" end="00:19:38.450" style="s2">this is actually what thinking looks</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.230" end="00:19:40.220" style="s2">like where you&#39;re able and that&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.450" end="00:19:43.010" style="s2">a process of courage and it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.220" end="00:19:45.560" style="s2">of self-reflection and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">things it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah mass media trans</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.560" end="00:19:51.390" style="s2">people to say what sounds smart</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">in education major mainstream university</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.390" end="00:19:54.090" style="s2">education generally trains people to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2">what sounds smart</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.090" end="00:19:59.160" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s not what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">thought through rigorously for oneself</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.160" end="00:20:04.980" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s gonna advance you in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:06.360" style="s2">type of society that we live in and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.980" end="00:20:08.520" style="s2">know one thing that&#39;s great about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.360" end="00:20:09.930" style="s2">intellectual dark web is that I get the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.520" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re accountable to their</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.930" end="00:20:13.920" style="s2">audience mainstream media is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:15.450" style="s2">accountable to their audience they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.920" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">accountable to their advertisers because</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:18.930" style="s2">that&#39;s who&#39;s paying the bills that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:20.670" style="s2">right all right so that&#39;s a huge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.930" end="00:20:22.110" style="s2">a huge difference and that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.670" end="00:20:23.610" style="s2">to be flexible nimble and they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:25.260" style="s2">be like okay we&#39;ve been asked to two of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.610" end="00:20:27.510" style="s2">us to do a podcast or let&#39;s have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.260" end="00:20:29.100" style="s2">four of us sit down they&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.510" end="00:20:31.560" style="s2">different they&#39;re like guerrilla you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.100" end="00:20:33.630" style="s2">know warfare it&#39;s just a different a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.560" end="00:20:36.360" style="s2">different mode of interacting and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.630" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">clearly effective and that was to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.360" end="00:20:39.750" style="s2">green halls idea of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:42.090" style="s2">versus the red the blue is still trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.750" end="00:20:43.470" style="s2">to catch up the legacy news media and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.090" end="00:20:46.980" style="s2">the left which is kind of become their</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.470" end="00:20:48.330" style="s2">hegemony like the mainstream no longer</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.980" end="00:20:49.950" style="s2">the counter cultural force is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.330" end="00:20:51.990" style="s2">understand how Trump and some of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:53.730" style="s2">right you know some of the red church</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.990" end="00:20:56.070" style="s2">has like a real warfare and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.730" end="00:20:57.210" style="s2">lining up like in the Civil War and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.070" end="00:20:58.860" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.210" end="00:21:00.450" style="s2">technology or the moves that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.860" end="00:21:02.430" style="s2">making and until we can figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.450" end="00:21:04.710" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna run circles around us and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.430" end="00:21:06.570" style="s2">I think we&#39;re just really in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.710" end="00:21:09.180" style="s2">in-between space of trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.570" end="00:21:12.390" style="s2">what the landscape is I pick up as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.180" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I mean in the UK at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.390" end="00:21:18.270" style="s2">we don&#39;t really have much advertising in</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">news the BBC is is advertising free I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.270" end="00:21:22.050" style="s2">used to work for Channel four News which</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">barely has an advertising as well but</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.050" end="00:21:25.920" style="s2">there is still the same same groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:29.390" style="s2">and I think actually a much more a much</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.920" end="00:21:32.040" style="s2">more powerful force is peer pressure</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.390" end="00:21:34.200" style="s2">it&#39;s what other people will think of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:37.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the groupthink within within</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.200" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">within any media industry I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.020" end="00:21:41.550" style="s2">sure the advertisers have much have much</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:43.020" style="s2">power over that at least at the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.550" end="00:21:45.660" style="s2">level of the individual decisions of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:47.070" style="s2">reporters it&#39;s much more am I a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.660" end="00:21:48.120" style="s2">person if I think this what will my</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:50.490" style="s2">friends think of me what will other</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.120" end="00:21:52.140" style="s2">people in the newsroom the reporters I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.490" end="00:21:55.830" style="s2">know I&#39;m much more worried about what</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.140" end="00:21:57.740" style="s2">other reporters think of them and other</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.830" end="00:22:01.250" style="s2">people within the industry think of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.740" end="00:22:02.600" style="s2">than the people outside it does depend</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.250" end="00:22:05.390" style="s2">though I think you know with gamergate</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.600" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">that the way that sort of began was you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.390" end="00:22:09.950" style="s2">know popular gaming websites very much a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.370" end="00:22:11.210" style="s2">church siding with the publishers when</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.950" end="00:22:13.610" style="s2">gamers were complaining about certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.210" end="00:22:15.290" style="s2">things and that created it sits a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.610" end="00:22:17.900" style="s2">microcosm of what&#39;s happening now in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.290" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">wider scale yeah it&#39;s we cannot trust us</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.900" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">sense makers therefore we need new sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">making apparatuses yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">yeah I mean it might be a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">different in the UK versus here because</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.910" style="s2">advertising bombards you on you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">cable news networks especially maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.910" end="00:22:36.770" style="s2">as much on broadcast television but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:38.750" style="s2">know activists on the left have learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.770" end="00:22:41.240" style="s2">that if you want to get someone like</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:43.670" style="s2">sean hannity or anyone on fox news to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.240" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">apologize for something go after their</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.670" end="00:22:47.809" style="s2">advertising revenue and tell those</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">companies that you&#39;re not gonna buy</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.809" end="00:22:50.780" style="s2">their products if they don&#39;t pull their</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:52.490" style="s2">ads from that show and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.780" end="00:22:54.890" style="s2">sudden the tune changes on the show so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.490" end="00:22:57.110" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.890" end="00:22:58.910" style="s2">interesting difference between the UK</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.110" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">and the US as well yeah this is a game</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.910" end="00:23:02.630" style="s2">coming back to brett and erik weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:05.420" style="s2">talking about it which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.630" end="00:23:09.230" style="s2">really great understanding certain types</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.420" end="00:23:11.929" style="s2">of things do not survive encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.230" end="00:23:13.490" style="s2">the profit motive and truth-seeking in</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.929" end="00:23:14.570" style="s2">particular does not survive an encounter</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.490" end="00:23:18.230" style="s2">with the profit motive</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.570" end="00:23:21.020" style="s2">so universities news anything that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.230" end="00:23:24.410" style="s2">involves seeking truth is corrupted by</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.020" end="00:23:25.460" style="s2">by by money in and so i think yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.410" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">probably is a very different situation</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.460" end="00:23:30.530" style="s2">here and I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:32.390" style="s2">speaking for the the farsightedness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.530" end="00:23:34.790" style="s2">the people who put the BBC together in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.390" end="00:23:36.620" style="s2">the 1920s was this is such a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.790" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">technology that we need to have it at</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.620" end="00:23:39.140" style="s2">least an arm&#39;s length from government</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.240" style="s2">and an arm&#39;s length from commercial</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.140" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">pressures which which I guess you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.240" end="00:23:45.620" style="s2">have we have National Public Radio NPR</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">but everyone on the right thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.620" end="00:23:50.009" style="s2">it&#39;s controlled by the government</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s also I mean the BBC is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.009" end="00:23:54.990" style="s2">massive organization it&#39;s got huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:57.509" style="s2">number TV stations huge number of radio</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.990" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">stations I mean no it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.509" end="00:24:04.049" style="s2">comparison is NPR&#39;s tiny yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:05.730" style="s2">get people really railing against</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.049" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">peterson with his patreon account and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.730" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">people making a lot of money but a part</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">of me is like okay so you set up a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:13.230" style="s2">patreon account of people like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:15.750" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you can be supported and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.230" end="00:24:18.840" style="s2">that&#39;s also just a different model</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.750" end="00:24:19.379" style="s2">you know it&#39;s decentralized to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.840" end="00:24:21.389" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.379" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there&#39;s problems with it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.389" end="00:24:27.809" style="s2">viewership paying directly for the kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:29.610" style="s2">of content that they&#39;d like to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.809" end="00:24:31.529" style="s2">yeah and and Peterson and these other</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.610" end="00:24:33.750" style="s2">guys seem to be pretty responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.529" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">what their audience asks of them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.750" end="00:24:39.019" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what&#39;s driving their</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:41.629" style="s2">whole the media operation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.019" end="00:24:44.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like these huge companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.629" end="00:24:46.879" style="s2">creating content that they think will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.039" end="00:24:49.289" style="s2">good for their advertisers or that their</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.879" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">bubble suggested is what people want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.289" end="00:24:52.639" style="s2">hear and then they just beam it out at</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.059" end="00:24:54.990" style="s2">everyone there&#39;s a new feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.639" end="00:24:57.570" style="s2">mechanism there&#39;s interaction here great</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.990" end="00:25:01.500" style="s2">mmm I&#39;m interested to ask you guys where</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.570" end="00:25:05.549" style="s2">you think we are we we just got an email</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.500" end="00:25:07.049" style="s2">from Ken Wilbur&#39;s people and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.549" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">tracking the same sort of thing Ken will</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.049" end="00:25:11.850" style="s2">be the integral philosopher our</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.789" style="s2">suggestion my suggestion in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.850" end="00:25:16.830" style="s2">the articles that I wrote was that what</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.789" end="00:25:19.169" style="s2">is happening is an emerging integral</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.830" end="00:25:21.500" style="s2">conversation so integral for people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.169" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2">don&#39;t know is is the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.500" end="00:25:26.789" style="s2">ideological ways of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">and integral is a kind of almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.789" end="00:25:31.470" style="s2">evolutionary step change beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:33.330" style="s2">into a space where we&#39;re able to see all</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.470" end="00:25:37.830" style="s2">the ideologies but able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.330" end="00:25:40.710" style="s2">access a place beyond that and that to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.830" end="00:25:42.899" style="s2">me feels accurate as a kind of diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.710" end="00:25:45.179" style="s2">and I&#39;m fascinated to what you guys make</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.899" end="00:25:46.860" style="s2">of why it&#39;s emerging now what it shows</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.179" end="00:25:48.809" style="s2">about the society we&#39;re in and where it</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.860" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">might be going as a as a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.809" end="00:25:52.889" style="s2">well I do think I remember hearing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:57.179" style="s2">it might have been Jeff Salzburg on</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.889" end="00:25:59.470" style="s2">daily the walls were this city of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.179" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">intellectual dark web is integral</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.470" end="00:26:03.460" style="s2">you know like on the one hand yes like</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:05.110" style="s2">trying to I think a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.460" end="00:26:07.720" style="s2">integral community are trying to grapple</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.110" end="00:26:09.850" style="s2">with say Jordan Peterson one minute he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.720" end="00:26:12.970" style="s2">feeling completely integral the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.850" end="00:26:14.500" style="s2">moment he&#39;s sounding not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.970" end="00:26:15.880" style="s2">unpack it I know there&#39;s no clear you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.500" end="00:26:17.230" style="s2">cross the threshold in you are an</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.880" end="00:26:19.030" style="s2">integral you&#39;re not you&#39;re always moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.230" end="00:26:22.090" style="s2">back and forth whatnot I guess you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.030" end="00:26:24.490" style="s2">stabilize or Center and more one stage</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.090" end="00:26:26.620" style="s2">than another but I know one critique or</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.490" end="00:26:29.860" style="s2">one challenge for Peterson and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.620" end="00:26:31.320" style="s2">intellectual dark web in general is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.860" end="00:26:34.060" style="s2">when they start to critique</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.320" end="00:26:35.470" style="s2">post-modernism either scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.060" end="00:26:38.530" style="s2">materialism or the worldcentric</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.470" end="00:26:40.060" style="s2">post-modernism as if it&#39;s a mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.530" end="00:26:43.390" style="s2">there should be more of a movement</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.060" end="00:26:46.570" style="s2">backwards or away from that might not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.390" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">constituting integral thinking because</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.570" end="00:26:51.940" style="s2">in in integral philosophy or theory you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.040" style="s2">want to transcend and include all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.940" end="00:26:56.650" style="s2">stages and modalities of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.040" end="00:26:59.530" style="s2">all the truths prior so you want to move</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.650" end="00:27:00.610" style="s2">into and above and beyond scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.530" end="00:27:03.040" style="s2">materialism which can be very</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.610" end="00:27:05.260" style="s2">reductionist stick and materialistic you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">know empirically back to science to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.260" end="00:27:08.710" style="s2">include more of the numinous than</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:11.110" style="s2">mythological the spiritual metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.710" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s different than the mythic or</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.110" end="00:27:15.280" style="s2">the magical their archaic levels and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:16.450" style="s2">think sometimes I think of it as like</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.280" end="00:27:18.730" style="s2">chakra systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.450" end="00:27:21.370" style="s2">you know there&#39;s truth to each chakra</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.730" end="00:27:24.130" style="s2">and a lot of people in the self-help or</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.370" end="00:27:26.620" style="s2">on the left or in the there loves Paris</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.130" end="00:27:28.180" style="s2">would love that yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.620" end="00:27:29.650" style="s2">but there are these Hattie or that these</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.180" end="00:27:31.390" style="s2">spiritual centers but there&#39;s like I see</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.650" end="00:27:34.390" style="s2">Petersen sometimes is reclaiming like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.390" end="00:27:36.520" style="s2">amber orange amber red and these lower</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:39.250" style="s2">chakras I get your room in order learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.520" end="00:27:42.070" style="s2">how to really to money and to sex and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:44.410" style="s2">power and those are difficult shadow</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.070" end="00:27:47.380" style="s2">places especially folks in a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.410" end="00:27:49.690" style="s2">yeah community I suppose the question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.380" end="00:27:51.550" style="s2">how big can your container be you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.690" end="00:27:53.260" style="s2">how big is an individual how much can</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.550" end="00:27:55.420" style="s2">you hold and that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.260" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">that&#39;s where I see the link with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.420" end="00:28:00.460" style="s2">intellectual dark web and the integral</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:01.780" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s an entirely integral</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.460" end="00:28:03.970" style="s2">way of looking at the world I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.780" end="00:28:05.800" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it&#39;s you know as you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.970" end="00:28:09.280" style="s2">it goes up and down and it&#39;s just more</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.800" end="00:28:11.680" style="s2">chaotic than that but you know I much</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.280" end="00:28:13.210" style="s2">get that sense of that&#39;s what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.680" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.210" end="00:28:18.309" style="s2">you said be able to hold the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:22.690" style="s2">as well as the the kind of the higher</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.309" end="00:28:24.190" style="s2">levels of you know understanding and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.690" end="00:28:26.440" style="s2">know you mentioned the pre trans fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.190" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">before it&#39;s it&#39;s also being able to pick</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.440" end="00:28:30.760" style="s2">out when is that pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:34.029" style="s2">understanding actually supporting a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.760" end="00:28:36.039" style="s2">bigger integration of society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.029" end="00:28:38.110" style="s2">because we do need all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.039" end="00:28:41.320" style="s2">and I think it is confusing for people</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.110" end="00:28:43.179" style="s2">because you know Peterson one you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:45.880" style="s2">is there&#39;s many different Peterson&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.179" end="00:28:49.899" style="s2">a way but part of integral is that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.880" end="00:28:52.210" style="s2">can hold all of these different levels</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.899" end="00:28:53.620" style="s2">of development and honor them and know</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.210" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">that they each have their own place</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.620" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">within the whole mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">and so that&#39;s really you know that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:02.049" style="s2">exciting prospect to see society moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:06.850" style="s2">towards there but it is like a birth</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.049" end="00:29:09.460" style="s2">it&#39;s um hard yeah I mean I&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.850" end="00:29:12.460" style="s2">Wilber deeply from for probably five or</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:16.059" style="s2">six years starting around a time I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.460" end="00:29:18.940" style="s2">like 19 through Wilber I got interested</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.059" end="00:29:21.789" style="s2">in this Swiss cultural historian and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.940" end="00:29:24.490" style="s2">cultural phenomenologist jean gebser who</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.789" end="00:29:27.610" style="s2">inspired Wilbur in many ways and also</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.490" end="00:29:29.799" style="s2">Sri Aurobindo who is connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.610" end="00:29:32.169" style="s2">founding of CI is actually another</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.799" end="00:29:36.340" style="s2">integral philosopher and I really like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.169" end="00:29:38.679" style="s2">Jeffers way of framing the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.340" end="00:29:40.539" style="s2">the human species he&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.679" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">suspicious of the term evolution because</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.539" end="00:29:46.840" style="s2">it implies progress and for gebser</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:48.520" style="s2">the consciousness moves through these</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.840" end="00:29:50.890" style="s2">structures in a way that&#39;s both both</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.520" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">progressive and regressive you gain</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.890" end="00:29:54.309" style="s2">something and you lose something with</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.809" style="s2">each movement until you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.309" end="00:29:58.510" style="s2">integral which then it reclaims</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.809" end="00:30:00.309" style="s2">everything alright so the archaic</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.510" end="00:30:03.460" style="s2">structure is when we&#39;re still primal</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.309" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">people&#39;s immersed within nature no sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.460" end="00:30:07.510" style="s2">of differentiation between the human</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:09.730" style="s2">being has some special species with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.510" end="00:30:11.860" style="s2">spirit that none of the rest of nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.730" end="00:30:13.330" style="s2">has right then you get magical</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.860" end="00:30:16.360" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s the next structure</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.330" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">where human beings begin to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.360" end="00:30:22.149" style="s2">the power that comes from language and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:23.590" style="s2">symbol and you know they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.149" end="00:30:24.220" style="s2">gaining a sense for Shan shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.590" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.220" end="00:30:30.179" style="s2">and ritual and then from there you move</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:33.220" style="s2">to the mythic where story and narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.179" end="00:30:35.230" style="s2">becomes more pronounced so it&#39;s not just</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:03.300" style="s2">next because you have people like</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.080" end="00:33:05.160" style="s2">Peterson who is bringing some important</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.300" end="00:33:07.380" style="s2">points and perspectives and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.160" end="00:33:09.510" style="s2">missing the mark and mischaracterizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.380" end="00:33:10.860" style="s2">Foucault yeah nobody&#39;s perfect but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.510" end="00:33:12.270" style="s2">great because then we can hear that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:14.460" style="s2">say okay great let&#39;s take some of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.270" end="00:33:16.680" style="s2">points that Peterson&#39;s point out to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.460" end="00:33:19.290" style="s2">real shadows on the left and then post</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.680" end="00:33:21.030" style="s2">murder knee you see where he&#39;s lining up</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.290" end="00:33:23.640" style="s2">with people like Ken Wilber jean gebser</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.030" end="00:33:25.920" style="s2">or whatnot and you can bring in people</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.640" end="00:33:28.620" style="s2">who really know the philosophy within</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.920" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">post modernity or post post modernity or</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.620" end="00:33:32.010" style="s2">hyper modernity and we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:34.470" style="s2">synthesize and kind of piece together</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.010" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">what is that&#39;s not it that&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.470" end="00:33:37.830" style="s2">that&#39;s not it but what&#39;s the new and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.570" style="s2">Adam Roberts on our podcast did</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.830" end="00:33:41.370" style="s2">something great which I guess it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.570" end="00:33:43.080" style="s2">Foucault I don&#39;t remember about when the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">new shows up it&#39;s monstrous</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.080" end="00:33:47.490" style="s2">yeah it often shows up as monstrous but</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:49.740" style="s2">you can feel an archetypal charge there</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.490" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">and Newman is charged that&#39;s electric</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.740" end="00:33:53.280" style="s2">and that is just signaling whether you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:56.490" style="s2">love it or hate it or polarized by it</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.280" end="00:33:58.890" style="s2">it&#39;s touching into a nerve center on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.490" end="00:34:01.170" style="s2">collective unconscious level on an</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.890" end="00:34:03.090" style="s2">archetypal level what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.170" end="00:34:04.650" style="s2">that&#39;s what I love young and Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.090" end="00:34:06.450" style="s2">idea of young bringing in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.650" end="00:34:07.260" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make sense of because</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.450" end="00:34:09.990" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.260" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">your own individual psychology and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.990" end="00:34:13.169" style="s2">love James Hillman you know here&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:14.669" style="s2">about we&#39;ve had a hundred years of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.169" end="00:34:17.580" style="s2">psychotherapy and the world is getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.669" end="00:34:18.840" style="s2">worse it&#39;s like what is going on and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.580" end="00:34:20.280" style="s2">wants to bring psychology out of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.840" end="00:34:23.490" style="s2">consulting room out of the one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.280" end="00:34:25.530" style="s2">it&#39;s about me my problem my pain this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.490" end="00:34:28.110" style="s2">just my childhood my mom to this my dad</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.530" end="00:34:29.730" style="s2">did this and bring it into the world I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.110" end="00:34:34.260" style="s2">would bring it into politics into</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.730" end="00:34:35.639" style="s2">environmentalism but also I love the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.260" end="00:34:37.260" style="s2">project of Hillman because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.639" end="00:34:38.790" style="s2">reinventing he&#39;s saying if we take</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.260" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">psychology with just the care of soul</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.790" end="00:34:44.280" style="s2">and the study of soul and we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.950" style="s2">daemon as and the soul and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.280" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2">the spiritual core of us it all gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.950" end="00:34:49.800" style="s2">flattened</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:52.230" style="s2">and here is probably with Wilbur and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.800" end="00:34:53.730" style="s2">Peterson by flatland you know scientific</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.230" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">materialism which only keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.730" end="00:34:59.369" style="s2">horizontal and the superficial level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">material reality on that point and to</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.369" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">your point as well of this cutting off</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:07.470" style="s2">from the lower archaic levels with which</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">we need III often wander in my head with</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.470" end="00:35:13.109" style="s2">with Peterson and Harris having these</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:15.690" style="s2">debates I&#39;m like is is it not the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.109" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">as psychology being stuck in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.690" end="00:35:20.579" style="s2">consulting-room in a sense because in</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">order to integrate the the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.579" end="00:35:25.190" style="s2">archaic what Terence Mckenna called the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.470" end="00:35:28.650" style="s2">archaic revival that&#39;s an experiential</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.190" end="00:35:31.430" style="s2">mode of being not an intellectual one so</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.650" end="00:35:35.220" style="s2">they can debate for a hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.430" end="00:35:37.260" style="s2">probably Harris won&#39;t shift into feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.220" end="00:35:38.910" style="s2">the numinous and kind of being down and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.260" end="00:35:41.910" style="s2">dirty in a cave dance to be like oh god</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.910" end="00:35:45.750" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a tension that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:47.220" style="s2">is it&#39;s yet to be resolved because part</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.750" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">of it you know I think parents McKenna</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.220" end="00:35:52.950" style="s2">was right part of that archaic revival</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:54.869" style="s2">is reclaiming those ritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:57.930" style="s2">which for scientific materialist is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.869" end="00:35:59.819" style="s2">total woowoo you know and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.930" end="00:36:01.260" style="s2">a it&#39;s a difficult tension to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.819" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">but it&#39;s one I think needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:04.980" style="s2">resolved in a different way than purely</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:06.750" style="s2">through debate that&#39;s important but</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.980" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">there needs to be something else some</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.750" end="00:36:12.329" style="s2">experiential element yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.339" style="s2">guess this this is sort of pointing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.329" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">forward as well</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.339" end="00:36:21.859" style="s2">towards what a deeper resolution might</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:25.230" style="s2">be because we&#39;ve talked as well about</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.859" end="00:36:27.150" style="s2">the intellectual potentially I see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.230" end="00:36:30.390" style="s2">intellectual dark web potentially coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.150" end="00:36:31.940" style="s2">to some kind of synthesis in terms of I</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.390" end="00:36:34.050" style="s2">already think that some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.940" end="00:36:38.130" style="s2">approaching that like Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.050" end="00:36:40.710" style="s2">talks about how all maps must all true</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.130" end="00:36:42.150" style="s2">maps must align so that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.710" end="00:36:43.710" style="s2">there through evolutionary biology you</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.790" end="00:41:36.290" style="s2">specific that you lose the diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.790" end="00:41:40.970" style="s2">you force everyone to conform to one</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.290" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">story but also not so diffuse that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.970" end="00:41:46.119" style="s2">there&#39;s no common value system then can</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.119" end="00:41:52.430" style="s2">into the future because this is not a</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.430" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">that capitalistic economists keep</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.170" end="00:42:08.329" style="s2">what do we want to be doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.480" end="00:42:10.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a want to speak to the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.329" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">of individual individualism or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.670" end="00:42:15.260" style="s2">individual yeah because I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">kind of cat the way I say it is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">of catch-22 like I&#39;m I&#39;m also very</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:20.599" style="s2">energized by Peterson&#39;s focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">individual I&#39;ve done a lot of sort of</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.920" end="00:42:29.720" style="s2">of describe that sort of selfish or</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.630" end="00:42:31.940" style="s2">solipsistic and my experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.720" end="00:42:34.569" style="s2">only by really going deeply into myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.940" end="00:42:37.849" style="s2">and really identifying kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.569" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">things that I have that keep me selfish</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.849" end="00:42:41.900" style="s2">keep me divided from other people am I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:42.410" style="s2">really able to come into community with</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.640" end="00:42:53.810" style="s2">the ultimate catch-22 and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.859" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">big sticking point for the left when</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.810" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">they hear people talking like Peterson</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">because like no no it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.910" end="00:43:03.890" style="s2">collective it&#39;s about the society my</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:06.710" style="s2">sense is you cannot jump to that point</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.890" end="00:43:08.839" style="s2">you can only get to that point from a</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2">point something Alan Watts used to talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.420" end="00:43:34.589" style="s2">about as well it&#39;s that and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.250" end="00:43:36.690" style="s2">see this a lot on the left or you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.589" end="00:43:39.030" style="s2">in progressive circles is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.690" end="00:43:41.310" style="s2">real effort thing to create something</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.030" end="00:43:43.320" style="s2">that only really has an impact if it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.310" end="00:43:45.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t effort it you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.320" end="00:43:46.710" style="s2">coming within means that you&#39;re you you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.330" end="00:43:48.540" style="s2">know you&#39;re owning your stuff you are</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.540" end="00:43:53.910" style="s2">compassion and your inclusivity emerges</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.849" end="00:43:56.339" style="s2">naturally because that&#39;s how you are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.910" end="00:43:58.619" style="s2">can&#39;t help being like that when the ego</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.339" end="00:44:02.070" style="s2">is trying to mimic that it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.619" end="00:44:04.290" style="s2">that it goes into well authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.070" end="00:44:06.990" style="s2">at the worst and at least a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.290" end="00:44:09.660" style="s2">bullying and kind of snide Ness on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.990" end="00:44:12.900" style="s2">other end and so again that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.660" end="00:44:17.480" style="s2">part of a necessity for me of this kind</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.480" end="00:44:21.180" style="s2">recontextualizing focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.530" end="00:44:22.320" style="s2">individual it&#39;s not a selfish thing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.180" end="00:44:23.670" style="s2">is kind of a selfish thing but it will</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.320" end="00:44:25.530" style="s2">lead you to a selfless place it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.670" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">good so first I mean this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.530" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">pendulum right we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">different ways pendulum swings and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:33.839" style="s2">think you&#39;re absolutely right that idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.470" end="00:44:35.550" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s kind of like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:38.250" style="s2">helman to saying we need to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.550" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">the consulting-room into the world but</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.250" end="00:44:41.820" style="s2">there&#39;s been a move you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:43.380" style="s2">like either it&#39;s all self work</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.820" end="00:44:44.670" style="s2">everyone&#39;s in therapy for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.380" end="00:44:46.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all about what&#39;s going on with me</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.670" end="00:44:48.630" style="s2">no one&#39;s being active no one&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.680" end="00:44:51.270" style="s2">to the world trying to help change</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">systems of oppression you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.270" end="00:44:54.570" style="s2">person of color sitting in a therapy</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:57.180" style="s2">office and they&#39;re saying oh well your</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.570" end="00:44:58.830" style="s2">anxiety or your depression is connected</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.180" end="00:45:00.089" style="s2">to what your mother&#39;s did your father</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:02.220" style="s2">did and you&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.089" end="00:45:04.230" style="s2">system&#39;s level of oppression or violence</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.220" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">but then you also have this real strong</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.230" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">swing towards tackling the systems and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.849" style="s2">the systemic inequality and injustice</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:14.430" style="s2">and collective you have activists who</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.849" end="00:45:17.420" style="s2">are not only burning out getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.430" end="00:45:21.180" style="s2">different forms of PTSD but are also not</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.420" end="00:45:23.849" style="s2">doing the inner work around their own</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.180" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">personal trauma and healing work that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.849" end="00:45:27.000" style="s2">needs to happen and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:30.300" style="s2">interested in this in this intersection</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.000" end="00:45:33.000" style="s2">of personal trauma and collective trauma</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.300" end="00:45:34.320" style="s2">and when are you speaking about one form</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.000" end="00:45:35.580" style="s2">but it&#39;s coming out another way and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.320" end="00:45:37.329" style="s2">think there are a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.580" end="00:45:40.719" style="s2">fighting beautifully for important</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.329" end="00:45:42.489" style="s2">of Justice inequality who might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.719" end="00:45:45.269" style="s2">charged and really angry because they</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.489" end="00:45:48.190" style="s2">have undigested unprocessed and healed</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.269" end="00:45:50.229" style="s2">personal trauma however that could look</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.190" end="00:45:51.579" style="s2">there&#39;s not to deny that collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.229" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting on bit and on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.579" end="00:45:56.380" style="s2">behalf of a group of a marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:59.529" style="s2">oppressed group but there&#39;s no language</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.380" end="00:46:01.029" style="s2">or container to talk about like whoa now</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.529" end="00:46:03.190" style="s2">it feels like you&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.029" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">systemic issue but it&#39;s coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.190" end="00:46:09.279" style="s2">very deep low place of PTSD and trauma</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:13.809" style="s2">I saw a Twitter bio yesterday that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.279" end="00:46:16.180" style="s2">kind of activists all angry like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.809" end="00:46:18.789" style="s2">fetishization of anger it&#39;s a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.180" end="00:46:19.989" style="s2">that on the left it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.789" end="00:46:22.359" style="s2">should be angry look at the way the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.989" end="00:46:24.069" style="s2">world is it&#39;s like that doesn&#39;t seem a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.359" end="00:46:27.130" style="s2">very ground a place to make the changes</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.069" end="00:46:29.469" style="s2">we need to we need to make right you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.130" end="00:46:32.469" style="s2">know this relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.469" end="00:46:35.559" style="s2">individual and the community or society</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.469" end="00:46:38.049" style="s2">is it&#39;s a dialectical one it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.559" end="00:46:39.640" style="s2">recursive it&#39;s a loop right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.049" end="00:46:42.309" style="s2">not like we just come into the world as</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.640" end="00:46:44.799" style="s2">responsible free thinking individuals a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.309" end="00:46:46.749" style="s2">certain kind of community is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.799" end="00:46:48.579" style="s2">that values those things and instills</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.749" end="00:46:51.940" style="s2">them and culture it&#39;s that and young</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.579" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">people so if human beings don&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.940" end="00:46:58.269" style="s2">into a situation wherein there&#39;s equal</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:59.529" style="s2">opportunity for quality housing you live</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.269" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">in a good neighborhood they go to a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.529" end="00:47:03.940" style="s2">school they have good food if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:05.499" style="s2">have get this equal opportunity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.940" end="00:47:07.509" style="s2">not gonna be able to become individuals</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.499" end="00:47:08.739" style="s2">so you already it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a loop</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.509" end="00:47:10.869" style="s2">right it&#39;s a chicken and the egg problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.739" end="00:47:14.109" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have the kind of society</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.869" end="00:47:16.359" style="s2">that values you know early childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.109" end="00:47:18.309" style="s2">early education as the platform upon</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.359" end="00:47:20.410" style="s2">which you then get free thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.309" end="00:47:23.650" style="s2">responsible individuals you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.410" end="00:47:24.729" style="s2">get those as adults and so but at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.650" end="00:47:26.140" style="s2">same time you&#39;re not gonna have that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.729" end="00:47:28.809" style="s2">kind of society unless you have free</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.140" end="00:47:30.910" style="s2">thinking responsible adults to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.809" end="00:47:33.699" style="s2">creating it and maintaining it so where</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.910" end="00:47:34.809" style="s2">do we start it&#39;s like there&#39;s we have in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.699" end="00:47:36.699" style="s2">our work to do and there&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.809" end="00:47:38.859" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s kind of like clean your</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.699" end="00:47:40.209" style="s2">room and maybe we should also</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.859" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">acknowledge it some people&#39;s rooms are</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.209" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">just two walls with no ceiling on it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:46.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to clean it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:48.459" style="s2">with hurricanes and rain that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.380" end="00:47:49.100" style="s2">important to remember I think it&#39;s a yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.459" end="00:47:50.810" style="s2">ad</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.100" end="00:47:52.820" style="s2">certainly right but it&#39;s gotta start</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.810" end="00:47:54.500" style="s2">somewhere my my own feeling is it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.820" end="00:47:55.610" style="s2">a there&#39;s got to be an acknowledgment</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.500" end="00:47:57.530" style="s2">that of course begun have equal</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.610" end="00:47:59.030" style="s2">opportunity right now but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.530" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">start somewhere because I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.030" end="00:48:02.750" style="s2">this and you know activist communities</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:06.020" style="s2">as well trying to change an entire</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.750" end="00:48:07.490" style="s2">system yeah where it is where do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.020" end="00:48:09.860" style="s2">start start with the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.490" end="00:48:12.410" style="s2">system it&#39;s not perfect but there seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.860" end="00:48:14.510" style="s2">to be a kind of mismatch between</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.410" end="00:48:15.770" style="s2">actually superior talks about this as</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.510" end="00:48:18.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s like if you say something is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.770" end="00:48:19.790" style="s2">systemic then it&#39;s it&#39;s almost so big</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s like what the hell are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.790" end="00:48:23.960" style="s2">do you know so at least focusing even in</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">that model on individual institutions</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.960" end="00:48:27.980" style="s2">like this institution is corrupt I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.720" style="s2">gonna focus with ten other people or</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.980" end="00:48:31.670" style="s2">individual actions or individual actions</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.720" end="00:48:34.100" style="s2">within those institutions you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.670" end="00:48:36.140" style="s2">got to narrow down to a degree otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.100" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s completely unmanageable yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.140" end="00:48:41.240" style="s2">started to get this feeling during the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">Occupy protests in 2011 or so where all</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.240" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">these people are out there protesting I</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:46.310" style="s2">felt energized by it but there was no</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">sense of directing that energy into</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:53.990" style="s2">yeah and I got to realizing like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.220" end="00:48:55.220" style="s2">all railing against capitalism it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.990" end="00:48:56.690" style="s2">well it&#39;s so big it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.220" end="00:48:58.460" style="s2">abstraction where&#39;s capitalism where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.690" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">capitalism and we&#39;re out there in front</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.460" end="00:49:03.110" style="s2">of these huge bank buildings protesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:04.700" style="s2">and I realized that you know I thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.110" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">any minute those executives at the top</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.700" end="00:49:08.450" style="s2">floor we&#39;re gonna realize like okay push</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.710" end="00:49:09.710" style="s2">the emergency button you cashed out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.450" end="00:49:11.330" style="s2">the ATM is on the streets and will</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.710" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">disperse the people immediately yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.330" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">because capitalism it&#39;s inside of all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:17.930" style="s2">us when we see money we&#39;re like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.920" end="00:49:19.700" style="s2">become money grubbers and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.930" end="00:49:20.600" style="s2">where&#39;s the enemy really if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.700" end="00:49:23.090" style="s2">fighting against something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.600" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2">systemic you know it&#39;s not separate from</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.090" end="00:49:30.080" style="s2">you and it shifts the anger from being</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.980" end="00:49:32.300" style="s2">just directed outward to a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.080" end="00:49:34.040" style="s2">kind of emotion that&#39;s maybe like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.300" end="00:49:35.620" style="s2">just as urgent but more curious like</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.040" end="00:49:38.570" style="s2">okay this is something I need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.620" end="00:49:40.520" style="s2">exercise from this self as much as from</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.570" end="00:49:41.840" style="s2">anyone else sure and to Peterson&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.520" end="00:49:44.090" style="s2">about that kind of medium resolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.840" end="00:49:46.040" style="s2">grand narrative yeah the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.090" end="00:49:48.350" style="s2">EPs I was at Occupy London when all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.040" end="00:49:50.120" style="s2">police came with the horses and we were</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.350" end="00:49:52.580" style="s2">all standing there I had thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.120" end="00:49:54.260" style="s2">like hmm I wanted to die for this and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.580" end="00:49:55.670" style="s2">then I was like you guys really sorry</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.260" end="00:49:57.320" style="s2">for like what are we willing to die for</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.670" end="00:49:59.060" style="s2">because that is the kind of energy that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.320" end="00:50:01.010" style="s2">actually does change systems yes when</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.060" end="00:50:01.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like and unfortunate it often</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.010" end="00:50:04.190" style="s2">happens when pea</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.640" end="00:50:05.749" style="s2">in such a horrible position that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.190" end="00:50:08.299" style="s2">like well yeah that death could be</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.749" end="00:50:10.039" style="s2">preferable to my life but finding that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.299" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">you know the reintroduction of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.039" end="00:50:15.019" style="s2">meta-narrative in a new way for me is so</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">essential because it&#39;s like what can we</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.019" end="00:50:18.890" style="s2">all get behind butts currently we still</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">don&#39;t really have that what can we all</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.890" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">agree on is worth living for and dying</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.109" end="00:50:24.920" style="s2">for yeah that&#39;s also where Pearson&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:26.239" style="s2">know one of his critiques and challenges</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.920" end="00:50:29.299" style="s2">which is hard to hear from the left is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.239" end="00:50:30.680" style="s2">he brings back that old and charged word</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.299" end="00:50:32.900" style="s2">of responsibility personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.680" end="00:50:34.759" style="s2">responsibility and where is that in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.900" end="00:50:36.799" style="s2">these conversations and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.759" end="00:50:39.109" style="s2">provocative to try and grapple with but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.799" end="00:50:42.049" style="s2">to the point about a low-resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.109" end="00:50:43.640" style="s2">grand narrative you know clearly are</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.049" end="00:50:46.249" style="s2">fighting on behalf of the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.640" end="00:50:48.259" style="s2">impressions and and certain oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.249" end="00:50:50.359" style="s2">peoples but then it&#39;s like use this</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.259" end="00:50:52.970" style="s2">phrase out in one pot or interview and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.359" end="00:50:54.049" style="s2">he was like he was talking I think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.970" end="00:50:55.400" style="s2">the Christian Church she was like well a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.049" end="00:50:57.829" style="s2">certain boy you should have and say this</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.400" end="00:50:59.900" style="s2">is my cross to bear and this radical</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.829" end="00:51:01.789" style="s2">mystery that we&#39;re in as human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.900" end="00:51:03.710" style="s2">we&#39;re all show up and we all have our</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.789" end="00:51:05.960" style="s2">forms of suffering it can look a million</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.710" end="00:51:09.230" style="s2">different ways and some there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.960" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">archetypal the truths and level that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.230" end="00:51:13.249" style="s2">speech to like we each have a cross I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:14.869" style="s2">have my own cross I know it really well</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.249" end="00:51:17.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in therapy a long time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.869" end="00:51:18.710" style="s2">working on my shadow but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.299" end="00:51:20.509" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s like to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.710" end="00:51:23.180" style="s2">of color or there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.509" end="00:51:25.849" style="s2">ways but if we forget that truth there</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.180" end="00:51:28.190" style="s2">is some mystery in which we&#39;re all here</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.849" end="00:51:30.980" style="s2">on earth and we&#39;re trying to carry</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.190" end="00:51:34.190" style="s2">what&#39;s ours act in the world and help</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.980" end="00:51:37.210" style="s2">others and be a locus of sanity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.190" end="00:51:39.319" style="s2">kindness and goodness in this world</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.210" end="00:51:41.420" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the trick yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.319" end="00:51:44.599" style="s2">individuality is the highest value but</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.420" end="00:51:47.450" style="s2">your individuality is a gift it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.599" end="00:51:49.819" style="s2">belong to you in the sense that on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.450" end="00:51:52.190" style="s2">one hand UK if you&#39;re religious God gave</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.819" end="00:51:54.470" style="s2">you your individuality of your secular</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.190" end="00:51:57.230" style="s2">society instilled any of those values</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.470" end="00:51:59.569" style="s2">raised you to be capable of that mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.230" end="00:52:02.390" style="s2">once we start thinking that I belong to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.569" end="00:52:04.069" style="s2">myself I think we get into poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.390" end="00:52:05.569" style="s2">without an overarching grand</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.069" end="00:52:08.490" style="s2">low-resolution grand narrative about</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.569" end="00:52:10.290" style="s2">that meaning me is the only me</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.490" end="00:52:11.609" style="s2">yes me is the only thing left that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.290" end="00:52:13.800" style="s2">what everything gets relativized and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.609" end="00:52:16.470" style="s2">culturally constructed there was a great</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.800" end="00:52:18.150" style="s2">line in the Camille Paglia Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.470" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">Peterson talk where I think she said</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.150" end="00:52:23.310" style="s2">something like the sixties that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:24.900" style="s2">consciousness is primary and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.310" end="00:52:26.550" style="s2">the time that the left makes the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.900" end="00:52:27.810" style="s2">of thinking identity as primary is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.550" end="00:52:29.970" style="s2">actually the thing that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.810" end="00:52:32.070" style="s2">identity that&#39;s primary that the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.970" end="00:52:34.230" style="s2">revelation of the 60s and of young is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.070" end="00:52:36.660" style="s2">that consciousness the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.230" end="00:52:39.690" style="s2">transcends our current situation is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.660" end="00:52:41.070" style="s2">thing that&#39;s primary yeah that was a and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.690" end="00:52:43.380" style="s2">that was kind of the revolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.070" end="00:52:44.760" style="s2">60s I guess sparked by psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.380" end="00:52:46.140" style="s2">sparked by kind of the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.760" end="00:52:49.980" style="s2">why our consciousness is so much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.140" end="00:52:51.720" style="s2">than we ever realized and that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.980" end="00:52:53.940" style="s2">the sort of transcendent value that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.720" end="00:52:55.740" style="s2">need to kind of recover yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.940" end="00:52:58.109" style="s2">like a capital C consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.740" end="00:52:59.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exclude the body in a physical</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.109" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">world that somehow the body in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.550" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">physical world or manifestations or</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">expressions of this big you know capital</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:08.790" style="s2">C consciousness right mm-hmm well I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:10.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think Camille Paglia was talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.790" end="00:53:13.050" style="s2">about something that&#39;s stuck in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.680" end="00:53:14.520" style="s2">skull you know well it was young or</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.050" end="00:53:19.800" style="s2">someone I can&#39;t remember who talked</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.520" end="00:53:22.740" style="s2">about individuation as the move from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.800" end="00:53:25.290" style="s2">center of gravity being the ego or the s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.740" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">the self with a small ass to the self or</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.290" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">the capital S that move of your center</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:34.109" style="s2">of gravity your identity from small s s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">self to large as self is a profound move</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.109" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">and that that like without that move</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:42.510" style="s2">it&#39;s is that it&#39;s like you get what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:44.550" style="s2">would say I&#39;m out to a kind of socialist</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.510" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">value system but from the inside out</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.550" end="00:53:49.170" style="s2">rather than being imposed by an</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">authoritarian government hmm hmm you</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.170" end="00:53:53.880" style="s2">must do this way be this way you must</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:56.130" style="s2">give this much in tax whatever it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.880" end="00:53:58.140" style="s2">intrinsically motivated yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.130" end="00:54:01.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the shift that I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.140" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for do we you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.380" end="00:54:05.369" style="s2">this thought the other day it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:07.940" style="s2">word should there&#39;s a lot of shoots</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.369" end="00:54:10.380" style="s2">especially on the left and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.940" end="00:54:12.089" style="s2">should is a very interesting word and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.380" end="00:54:15.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting kind of state to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.089" end="00:54:15.080" style="s2">be in whereas actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.420" end="00:54:20.250" style="s2">it what we&#39;re saying is we we can get to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:22.049" style="s2">a place where it&#39;s not a should like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.250" end="00:54:24.900" style="s2">morality doesn&#39;t come from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.049" end="00:54:28.710" style="s2">should it comes from a place of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.900" end="00:54:32.099" style="s2">desire to do the things that we do and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.710" end="00:54:34.589" style="s2">the left has started as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.099" end="00:54:37.170" style="s2">resistance to the shoots of the of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.170" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">become its own yeah yeah I guess in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.640" end="00:54:46.530" style="s2">Uni in terms it&#39;s or kind of Campbell</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.530" end="00:54:50.430" style="s2">because we&#39;re kind of talking for those</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.210" end="00:54:52.260" style="s2">risk of an ego self confusion you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.430" end="00:54:53.970" style="s2">the ego becomes confused with the self</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.260" end="00:54:57.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s this kind of deep narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.970" end="00:54:59.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s more of a when the ego takes</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.180" end="00:55:01.589" style="s2">its natural place contained within the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.549" end="00:55:03.240" style="s2">self then you should there&#39;s no should</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.589" end="00:55:05.549" style="s2">you will you will behave in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.240" end="00:55:07.140" style="s2">way and that that&#39;s kind of the back at</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.549" end="00:55:10.140" style="s2">the point I was making of this this</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.140" end="00:55:13.049" style="s2">desire for things to be a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.140" end="00:55:14.670" style="s2">and should be that way and should maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.049" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">be forced to be that way that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.670" end="00:55:19.260" style="s2">some of where authoritarianism comes</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:22.410" style="s2">from on both sides actually instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.260" end="00:55:23.849" style="s2">this when we reach a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.410" end="00:55:25.500" style="s2">understanding within ourselves and as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.849" end="00:55:28.290" style="s2">community we will behave in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.500" end="00:55:29.430" style="s2">way we will behave this way and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.290" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.430" end="00:55:32.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky one to get to but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:35.790" style="s2">very convincing the ego can be very</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.579" end="00:55:38.130" style="s2">convincing mm-hmm I was not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.790" end="00:55:40.980" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know it I just had heard</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.980" end="00:55:44.569" style="s2">have been under Rogen it might&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.059" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">with his brother Eric on the Rubin show</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.569" end="00:55:47.790" style="s2">but when they talk about game theories</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">and they&#39;re talking about like these</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.790" end="00:55:54.869" style="s2">valleys and Peaks and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.220" end="00:55:56.339" style="s2">it&#39;s a game B or I don&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.869" end="00:55:59.369" style="s2">name less something talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.339" end="00:56:01.710" style="s2">Archer who has become well-known or he</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.369" end="00:56:03.690" style="s2">has seized youtubes that are and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.710" end="00:56:06.150" style="s2">apparently broken all the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.690" end="00:56:07.400" style="s2">classical traditional archery I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.150" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">could members name where I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.400" end="00:56:12.829" style="s2">butchering this but I watched I looked</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.630" end="00:56:20.490" style="s2">nothing it&#39;s nothing like the way we</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:22.049" style="s2">will see archery today but of course the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.490" end="00:56:24.119" style="s2">argument is that this is how people in</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.049" end="00:56:26.339" style="s2">indigenous cultures and and they could</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.119" end="00:56:27.830" style="s2">shoot three at a time or shoot rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.339" end="00:56:30.110" style="s2">and hit targets and be effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.830" end="00:56:32.060" style="s2">in warfare we&#39;re not but anyway his</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.110" end="00:56:33.770" style="s2">point in bringing that up was that in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.060" end="00:56:36.760" style="s2">this question of what&#39;s now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.770" end="00:56:39.170" style="s2">emerging what is how do we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.760" end="00:56:40.520" style="s2">that he&#39;s saying it&#39;s almost like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.170" end="00:56:41.540" style="s2">you&#39;re in the system you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.520" end="00:56:43.850" style="s2">system until there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.540" end="00:56:46.520" style="s2">spontaneous leap and step out of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.850" end="00:56:48.920" style="s2">and you kind of step completely out no</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.520" end="00:56:51.260" style="s2">one sees it coming it&#39;s it&#39;s a phase</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.920" end="00:56:54.170" style="s2">shift it&#39;s like there&#39;s enough there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.260" end="00:56:55.790" style="s2">enough that&#39;s evolved and you hit a</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.170" end="00:56:57.590" style="s2">tipping point and it&#39;s a phase shift and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.790" end="00:56:59.240" style="s2">so I&#39;ve just kind of been meditating and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.590" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">ruminating on that like it might not be</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.240" end="00:57:02.570" style="s2">what we&#39;re thinking we&#39;re thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:05.540" style="s2">these ways and something might come</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.570" end="00:57:07.130" style="s2">completely from left field and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.540" end="00:57:10.310" style="s2">what I like about the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.130" end="00:57:11.630" style="s2">web especially Brad Weinstein and Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.310" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">wheel and Eric and some of these others</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.630" end="00:57:16.070" style="s2">is they&#39;re really remaining open let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">not let&#39;s make sure we don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.070" end="00:57:22.120" style="s2">know everything there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:24.650" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s probably the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.120" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">split within the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:28.970" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got people like Steven</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:30.410" style="s2">Pinker in it who are like these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.970" end="00:57:32.090" style="s2">very Pangloss Ian they&#39;re worried</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.410" end="00:57:35.030" style="s2">everything&#39;s great the world is getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.090" end="00:57:36.950" style="s2">better every worried about and even you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.030" end="00:57:40.940" style="s2">saw that on the recent podcast with</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.950" end="00:57:43.460" style="s2">Shapiro wine Erik Weinstein and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.940" end="00:57:45.620" style="s2">Peterson and Dave Rubin Eric Weiss I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.460" end="00:57:47.300" style="s2">the only one saying hang on I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.620" end="00:57:48.860" style="s2">think you&#39;re right I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.300" end="00:57:51.620" style="s2">things are getting existential II more</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.860" end="00:57:52.520" style="s2">dangerous even though you track kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.620" end="00:57:54.590" style="s2">wealth or whatever and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.520" end="00:57:58.100" style="s2">getting better the risks are so much</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.590" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">worse and we&#39;re kind of screwed and most</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.100" end="00:58:01.910" style="s2">of the the guys who I know I really</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:03.830" style="s2">respect like the Daniel Shmack Tim</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.910" end="00:58:06.290" style="s2">burgers Jordan green Hall Eric and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.830" end="00:58:08.570" style="s2">Weinstein are all like waving red flags</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.290" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">and saying how on the existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.570" end="00:58:13.730" style="s2">are so huge the technology is so much</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:17.150" style="s2">better that we&#39;re in we&#39;re in a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.730" end="00:58:18.830" style="s2">difficult situation but also we talked</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.150" end="00:58:20.810" style="s2">to Daniel Shmack Tim burger and he used</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.830" end="00:58:22.490" style="s2">that phrase the phase shift he said</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.810" end="00:58:24.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at you can look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.490" end="00:58:25.940" style="s2">these indicators and see wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.200" end="00:58:28.850" style="s2">this is all getting very dangerous very</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.940" end="00:58:30.140" style="s2">difficult they&#39;re hardwired tribalism is</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.850" end="00:58:34.190" style="s2">likely to kill us and when all these</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.140" end="00:58:37.910" style="s2">things are are true but if you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.190" end="00:58:40.580" style="s2">he uses an example of a pregnant mother</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.910" end="00:58:42.950" style="s2">the babe nine months it would look like</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.580" end="00:58:44.810" style="s2">the baby was about to die because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.950" end="00:58:46.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s a phase shift about</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.810" end="00:58:49.850" style="s2">to happen and that&#39;s how he&#39;s choosing</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.820" end="00:58:53.270" style="s2">to see it as these are the birth pangs</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.850" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">were something new and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.270" end="00:58:57.800" style="s2">thing we don&#39;t know that there could</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:58:59.420" style="s2">very easily be a phase shift that were</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.800" end="00:59:01.880" style="s2">that we&#39;re going through into a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.420" end="00:59:03.590" style="s2">completely new phase yeah yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.880" end="00:59:05.510" style="s2">feel like the best between you right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.590" end="00:59:08.030" style="s2">is trying to cultivate a sensitivity a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.510" end="00:59:09.410" style="s2">heightened sensitivity to possibility so</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.030" end="00:59:11.060" style="s2">that when that new thing that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.410" end="00:59:15.650" style="s2">get us through this bottleneck appears</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.060" end="00:59:17.620" style="s2">we see it we feel it and it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.650" end="00:59:22.700" style="s2">look like what we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.620" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">imagining as the solution and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.700" end="00:59:28.940" style="s2">as we&#39;ve said the solutions of the past</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:31.250" style="s2">that have been fought for once that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.940" end="00:59:32.570" style="s2">group fighting for it wins you end up</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:34.100" style="s2">with a system worse than the one you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.570" end="00:59:35.480" style="s2">just destroyed right so it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.100" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">look like what we&#39;re used to looking for</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.480" end="00:59:41.780" style="s2">them how do we cultivate that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:44.090" style="s2">imagination that&#39;s required John Keats</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.780" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">called it negative capability you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.090" end="00:59:48.230" style="s2">think about what&#39;s not yet actualized</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">and hold yourself in that space of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.230" end="00:59:52.820" style="s2">tension mm-hmm so that when that phase</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.480" end="00:59:54.740" style="s2">shift is ready to happen you can jump to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.820" end="00:59:55.160" style="s2">the next chip that&#39;s gonna take us into</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.740" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.160" end="01:00:00.050" style="s2">I heard someone use the metaphor of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:03.590" style="s2">a baby bird in the shell and the egg and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.050" end="01:00:06.350" style="s2">that there&#39;s some release of a gas or</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.590" end="01:00:09.050" style="s2">some something that happens in the birds</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.350" end="01:00:10.310" style="s2">suddenly after resting there says I need</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.050" end="01:00:12.020" style="s2">to get out and it just doesn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.310" end="01:00:14.360" style="s2">what it&#39;s doing it starts pecking and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.020" end="01:00:16.100" style="s2">it&#39;s fracturing this encasing shell and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.360" end="01:00:18.950" style="s2">then it just emerges into that next</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.100" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">stage it feels there&#39;s some resonance in</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.950" end="01:00:23.540" style="s2">that kind of metaphor yeah so it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:26.030" style="s2">think in one sense we&#39;re things</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.540" end="01:00:28.520" style="s2">are really bad right now and like just</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.030" end="01:00:30.500" style="s2">to give Steven Pinker a little bit of a</p>
