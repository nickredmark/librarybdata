<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">of some things like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">you know mycelium and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">thing which tends to be a big sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">uh underground almost internet you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">that goes through the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">and you know communicates things in real</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">time right across say a forest or</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">so i mean but you know mycelia they</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">don&#39;t have opposable thumbs you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">they don&#39;t have symbolic reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">uh you know discrete memory they do have</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">a chemical memory which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">mycelium are very very interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">they they don&#39;t have uh uh they lack a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">in the ability to generalize and look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">the really big picture</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">and and also to uh work in to even</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">understand the idea of depth of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">you know i was looking at my dog the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">other day and he&#39;s a pretty damn smart</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">dog as dogs go</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">uh but he you know has definite</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">limitations for instance in this uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">place we&#39;re renting in pittsburgh for uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">a few weeks here waiting for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">grandchild to show up</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">uh i walk we walk the dog around the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">block and he has not yet figured out</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">that the we go out the back door through</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">the alley and then around the city block</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">he hasn&#39;t figured out yet that the front</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">door and the back door are somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">related but</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">but you know humans have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">to do that very easily a four-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">figures that out in one day</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">yeah and well i guess they&#39;re um they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">specialists aren&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">uh a lot of animals are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">specialists whereas we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">we&#39;re more generalists yep but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly a difference in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">capability and so hey we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re the ones who are the only</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">ones that really can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">responsible well we can we can see like</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">our minds are</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">such that we&#39;re able to perceive um</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">the entire system you know if we really</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">do put our minds to work the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">they were designed to be um we we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">perceive an entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">complex system but we can also perceive</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">the systems beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">that system and the way they interact</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">you know so i guess it&#39;s that unique</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">uh capacity that that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">you know we would say we&#39;ve been given</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">by the sort of hero ancestors and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">you know the creation entities um</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve been given those gifts you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">particularly so that we can be that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">custodial species</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">story in western australia they</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">you know they talk about there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">you know everything all the trees the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:25.840" style="s2">plants the animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">and you know humans were in there where</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">they were sitting down at that moment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">um to decide who who the carers for</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">everything were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">so that&#39;s the language they use now that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">they call it the carers of everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">um so who was going to care for all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">this and oversee it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">and you know it went through each of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">traits of each animal and the trees were</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">like well we can&#39;t move around</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">and you know and the kangaroo came</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">really close apparently</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">but um he just had these shitty little</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">arms you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">and they weren&#39;t quite going to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">yeah it ended up being the human beings</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">you know it had that capacity and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">hands are really important</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">you know they have a really big</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">significance um</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">spiritual significance in our cultures</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">the hands and for human beings all</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">around the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">world that&#39;s what you see on the cave</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">walls you know and that rock</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">art yep is always happening it goes all</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">over the world i&#39;ve seen them i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">where they people put their hands</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">against the wall and then apparently</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">they would take</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">uh paint put it in their mouth and spit</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">it out to produce those patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">was a common way they would do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">you know a handsome you know remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">and of course they</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">you know they&#39;re the things that allow</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">us to have that haptic cognition</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">you know where a tool becomes recognized</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">in our brain as an extension of our arm</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">you know they&#39;re the way we um you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">interact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">yeah and also tools uh i you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">worked with other people on</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">on a a theory of linguistics it may not</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">be true but it&#39;s possible that it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">which is that we learned how to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">multi-part tools before we develop</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">syntactical language</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">and it turned and it turns out based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">our analysis the tool making is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">in many ways similar to syntactic</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">language in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not rigid you can make the parts in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">a different order</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">but you have to put them together in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">same way to have the tools so it has</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">that both the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">uh kind of requirement and freedom</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">of language and that may well have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">that the mental capacity for building</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">is what we were able to leverage into</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">even more powerful uh tool of language</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">and potentially the language may have</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">developed out of need to sing</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s just a is an interesting little</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">thing to think about you know because um</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">you often see</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">like when your your grandchild is born</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">there you know and you watch</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">you watch them grow um you&#39;ll see kids</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">are always</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">like they&#39;re singing before they can</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">speak they&#39;re trying to sing you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like one of the first things we try</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">um you know the same way they try and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">before they can even stand up um</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">so i and i think the singing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">important because that&#39;s part of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s how you um you encode all those</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">of being the custodial species is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">uh ceremonies um you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">and you sing all those stories but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">sing</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">like i mentioned to you before about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">increase ceremonies</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">and the increased ceremonies are about</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">um not increasing the size of the system</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re a custodian of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">but increasing the combinatorials within</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">so you&#39;re increasing i love that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">increasing the connections between</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">you know so and you actually sing those</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">you sing them into being and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">taught this from a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">young age so i was talking to a samoan</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">someone followed yesterday and he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">um there&#39;s this concept they have um</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">like their word for warm data i guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">you&#39;d call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">is is i think it&#39;s va is what he said</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">and um it&#39;s it&#39;s an actual</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a force an energy it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">substance but it is the um</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that exists between</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">things in the relation between things</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">and he was telling tell me about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:32.160" style="s2">five stages that you go through and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">coming to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.160" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">increased knowledge of of that um that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">summer and warm data thing and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">uh the first one is when you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">young when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">just starting to stand um and right the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">way through when you&#39;re a toddler and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">you&#39;re a young kid</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">your mother will take you and put you um</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">there on the beach</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">and get you to pay attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">feet on the sand</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">and that var between your feet and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">sand that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">um that uh relation between them</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">but right at the edge of the water so</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">then the waves come up and wash over</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">your feet and so then you&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">connection between those</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">three things you know that that relation</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:17.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s the earliest you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">simplest form of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">um and so all of your all of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">cultural expression</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">um all of your ceremony ritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">and just the day you live the way you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">live from day to day</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">it&#39;s all about um working with those</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">working with that in between you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">which is just as real as as the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">themselves you know the connections</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">between things</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very real yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">absolutely and indeed that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">part of the modern thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">complexity which you and i both</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">enjoy studying as i often will say as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">shorthand to help people understand the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">idea of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">you know older science reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">science can be thought of as the study</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">of the dancers</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">while complexity can be thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">study of the dance</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">right the interrelationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">dancers right and the dance</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">is as real in fact i would argue in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">more real than the dance right than the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">dancers</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">i mean what is life but a dance of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">chemicals right</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">uh you know what is a society but a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">dance of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">and stuff uh and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">relationships and the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">are to my mind critical which actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">brings me to the first quote i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">to read from your book which i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">get your comment it&#39;s a perfect time for</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">oh by the way just to show you how</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">central custodial species is to your</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">book i</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">use my little tool i have and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">discovered that custodial species</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">appears 12 times in your book</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">so it is actually a very important</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">i found that authors don&#39;t often know</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">those kinds of things isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">anyway here&#39;s uh tyson on uh one of his</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">earlier not the first uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">writings in the book on custodial</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">species the book by the way is saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">talk read it or i&#39;ll kick your ass</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">uh here we go creation is in a constant</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">state of motion</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">and we must move with it as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">custodial species</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">or we will damage the system and doom</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">nothing can be held accumulated stored</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">every unit requires velocity and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">exchange in a stable system</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">or it will stagnate this applies to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">economic and social systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:38.839" style="s2">as well as natural ones that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that good yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">accumulation i think you know when</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">when you do you have that game in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">states past the parcel</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">think they do it in the uk too</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">at a birthday party or whatever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">like a little present</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">like a gift but it&#39;s got you know about</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">20 layers of wrapping around it and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">the kids sit in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">and they have to pass the parcel and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">they take off one one layer at a time</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">until finally the one who unwraps the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">gift they get to keep the gift</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">right and you see it they usually have</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">music playing and they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">really fast and everyone&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">excited</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">he&#39;s there and holds it and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">getting really uncomfortable and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">everyone&#39;s trying to get him to pass it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">on he won&#39;t pass it on</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">right that&#39;s one of the principles you</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">is interaction in all the nodes in that</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">there has to be this constant dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s resources materials</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all information really right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">one node that&#39;s like collecting all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">information for itself and holding it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">you know storing it or that energy you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">know it&#39;s the same with money</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">exactly money this actually just caused</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">the thought to jump into my head</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">people who listen to the show know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:55.880" style="s2">i&#39;m generally speaking a skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">of bitcoin and uh other similar kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.880" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">cryptocurrencies</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">and as it turns out if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">those money systems quantitatively you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">find that there&#39;s almost no velocity in</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">people never use them to buy anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s basically speculators</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">hoarders people sitting on nest eggs</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s no life to it there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">velocity in exchange</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">right and uh while i can in my money</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">uh which you can find on</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">uh youtube i have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">90 90-minute talk on uh uh dividend</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">money and alternative the central</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">uh we the one of the key things in it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">to make sure the system has</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">lots of velocity and lots of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">and lots of dynamism</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">uh you know a money system where people</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">just sit on their ass on top of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">you know that&#39;s sick actually and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">really what bitcoin is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s um i mean that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">mentioned i think in the last show was</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">i was talking about that uh that we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">increased paradigm as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">growth paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">having that velocity</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">um you know within the system of of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">information value you know um</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">objects yeah trade has to go like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">um so yeah i think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">some sort of qualitative easing might</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">look like instead of quantitative easing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">you know increasing the velocity of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">dollar and improving the health of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">system yep</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s ways that if our velocity</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">has been falling too it&#39;s been falling</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">for a number of years</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things i personally</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">follow as part of my work on monetary</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">now let&#39;s turn from this beautiful view</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">to the world we live in today</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">where i would say that so-called</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">is not doing a good job as a custodial</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">and until very recently didn&#39;t he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">even aware of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">that it had that role you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">still rushing towards the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">and at a break break next speed</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">and either will overpopulate the earth</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll deplete our soils we&#39;ll kill the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">uh micro uh species that live in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">soils that make</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">uh you know plant life uh viable</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">or we&#39;ll cook ourselves or we&#39;ll uh be</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">so crowded together and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">dealing with each other in such corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">ways that we&#39;ll have pandemic after</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">we don&#39;t seem to give a fuck about being</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:33.919" style="s2">the custodial species anymore at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">so-called civilization doesn&#39;t there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.919" end="00:20:38.559" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">and i think um i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.559" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">these things happen periodically</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">i think in in human populations</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">particularly after a cataclysm of some</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">um you know people experiment with these</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">unsustainable systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a place i live for a year in far</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">north queensland</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">called kuranda and kuranda is um</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a new landscape it&#39;s only like</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">10 000 years old because</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">you know it was there was a big volcanic</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">cataclysm there</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">and it ended up developing into a rain</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">and anyway there&#39;s a really big story</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">there um</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not as old as most of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">stories in australia it&#39;s a new one</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">because it&#39;s a new landscape you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">um that&#39;s very interesting yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">this uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">this big rainbow serpent sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">travels periodically down uh down to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">sea and then up onto the table land</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">along a waterway now that uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">the ocean there in that coast um</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">there was this kind of rare</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">spiral shell that the people there</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">started using as a fungible token</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">back then so they were like using it as</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">a a currency</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">basically so it was an experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">um so they were they were using that to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">to store value in their trades but there</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">were all these problems because</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">all of a sudden um things weren&#39;t moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">there was no velocity</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">there were people who were like</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">gathering these shells in piles and just</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">sort of keeping them you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s it slowed things down and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">know people were getting sick and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">things were going wrong and there were</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">lots of fights and this story</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">is the story of the first heist because</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">their rainbow snake had come up out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">and he&#39;d have a lot of these shells</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">stuck in his scales</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">and so he was ambushed by these</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">blackbird people you know going up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">hill</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">and they dropped a log on him and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">murdered him right there now um the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">rainbow snake is a a really big</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">one of those big creator beings you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">in our world view one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">the ones i was mentioning before one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">the really big really important creative</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">beings is really central to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">most aboriginal cultures all over</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">australia so it&#39;s a terrible thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">they&#39;d murdered</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">uh him and uh and after that people</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">decided to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.159" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">abandon that that currency and that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">system because it was just um</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">you know it was obviously going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">destroy everything and the warning of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">that story is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">you know you&#39;ll destroy creation itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re not sharing freely and having</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">constant uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">movement in whatever trading system you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">yeah you have to have the dynamism there</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of you know it has to work for</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">everybody right</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">why is that so hard why is civilization</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">not able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">question yeah and you actually propose a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">reason and i&#39;m gonna quote</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">uh uh actually let&#39;s let&#39;s wait till a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">little later for that one because</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">here&#39;s one that i&#39;d love you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">explicate for me as i was going through</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">the book again</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">uh for for today&#39;s talk i said this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">interesting but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">not sure i understand it let me ask the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">man himself</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">uh you say we are the custodians of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">and the arrow of time is not an</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">appropriate model for a custodial</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">species to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">operate from what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">damn interesting words but i&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">sure what it means</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">that was behind a lot of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">just little thought experiments i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">been doing um</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">with the first and second laws of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">and the idea that that maybe the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">second law is is not the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">appropriate model of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">um not the most productive one and um</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">you know maybe a better one if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">looking at um a whole heap of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">vast complex you know overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">interacting dynamic systems that may be</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">the first law of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">thermodynamics um might be worth looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">as a as an alternative model of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">because i guess the the arrow of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">you know as it&#39;s been created</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">is um is very much came come out of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">print-based cultures you know they</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">developed uh develop print in order to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">try and control the story of the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">you know so they they have printed</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">history and say well this is the version</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">of your history</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">and we&#39;re showing progress here because</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">things were really bad and dark and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">terrible in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">now they&#39;re better and every day is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">better therefore tomorrow will be better</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">you know um and so then you know they</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">write contracts to try and control the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">future as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">and they end up you know making these</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">civilizations fit onto that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">uh that that arrow of time and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">therefore that illusion of uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">progress and you know i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">illusion of progress and that um that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">sort of wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">story uh of progress that that uh big</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">lie</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">um i i think that&#39;s um that&#39;s the cause</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">of a lot of our destruction i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">all trapped on this arrow of time and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">speeding towards the precipice you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">exactly this is such game a heading for</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">you know i think it&#39;s that&#39;s a simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">explanation of it i kind of go into it a</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">bit more in the book</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">you know some of the ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">later i found out that charles darwin</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">had the same idea when he was messing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">around with physics</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">and of course you know physicists the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">hardcore physicists</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">uh many of them not all but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">a majority at this stage</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">time believe time is an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.279" style="s2">and that there may not actually be any</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">time and maybe everything happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.279" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">uh time is something that we impose upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">the structure of the universe isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">a weird thought right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">yeah well i know a lot of um a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">like really really</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">senior um law people clever people we</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">call them</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">um the way they the way they talk and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">interact with the world is is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">on a completely different model of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a scholar called um christine</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">black</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">and she wrote a book about indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">jurisprudence</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">called the land as the source of the law</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">she was telling me the other day that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">she&#39;s come to the conclusion that um</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">that those old people</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">uh live in a state of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">was how she put it well they could hop</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.640" style="s2">around between you know with our</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">you know aren&#39;t what&#39;s called uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.640" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">non-localism again something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">shows actually does exist in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">most all physicists believe that this</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">universe is non-local meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">uh things can go from a to b without</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">being anywhere in between</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">well talk about in the book a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">um tell his story and he&#39;s got um uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">i think about yeah half a dozen of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">symbols in the book are his</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">sand talk symbols that he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">share with the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">and when he first showed me those it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">more than just those there were about</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">there must have been two or three</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">hundred symbols you showed me all in one</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">um it nearly made my head burst but he</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">he he was blowing my mind and i he kept</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">saying things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">you know like he knew all about my life</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">you know and but and he was referring to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">things future events as they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">now and so and he said ah that place</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">where you&#39;re going tomorrow</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">thought the the possibility that um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">you know our minds can uh can exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">you know out of linear time in that way</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">another thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">i just had about time stimulated by this</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">conversation which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">uh you know kind of multifaceted which</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">uh game a or our status quo world has</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">distorted time in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">extraordinarily dangerous way uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve if you listen to my show</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me talk about that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">inner engine of game a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">is the quest for short-term money on</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">and how is money on money returned</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">denominated</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">by interest rates and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">thing about interest rates they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">exponential which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">that if it&#39;s ten percent interest the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">principal keeps growing</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">exponentially over time and if you turn</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">that around into a so-called discount</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">rate and say what is uh a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">dollars worth</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">in a hundred years the answer is almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">zero if you assume a ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">uh interest rate and so uh time</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">uh in game a in financial terms in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">world driven by money</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">yeah and that is that is why</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">we are not able to uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">do our duty as a custodial species as if</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">infinity is just gonna eat himself</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">until he&#39;s just ahead you notice also a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">zero right yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">no it&#39;s um it&#39;s a zero or some game i</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">yeah though it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">especially if we uh and remember that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">distinction between</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">growth into the macrocosm</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t hurt the earth to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">ever more intricate</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say let&#39;s think of engraving</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">our engravings become more intricate we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">don&#39;t consume more</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">wood when we do that but we add a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">more value to the world right</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really good metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">that&#39;s what i think that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">of is increase and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">growth is oh i i&#39;m going to do kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">shitty engravings but i&#39;m going to do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">whole bunch of them right</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">versus one very intricate very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">integrated engraving and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">change our mindset</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">towards richness in terms of detail</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">and connection and dynamics and away</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">from piling up</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">shit right uh you know the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">you know the worst idea in game a is he</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">who dies with the most toys wins</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">caution though like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">i mean you really really do have to know</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">you know because of that um that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">you know butterfly effect of tinkering</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">with um complex systems you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">uh you do an intervention over here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">you you it&#39;s very difficult to predict</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">or anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">you know which way that&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">you do some good over here and something</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">bad happens over there</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">um over that place i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">you know at corander when i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">traveling up to there i was traveling</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">from right down</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">right down in the south see coriander is</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">the the end of one of those big song</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">lines</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">um for the platypus story and i was down</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">at the start of that story at a place</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">called naron</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">lake in western new south wales and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">that story starts with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">a a water rat and a duck</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">doing the wrong thing and mating when</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t be mating you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">um god damn it i hate when that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">because scientists have found both water</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:45.760" style="s2">rat and duck dna in the platypus</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">how the hell does that happen anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.760" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">yeah i was following that song line but</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">then this um</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">this old lady this law woman clever</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">woman uh called me up</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">and you have to do what they say when</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">they tell you it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">i mean you don&#39;t have to i mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">dodge them if you want but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">you won&#39;t get asked to do anything else</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">and you won&#39;t they won&#39;t share anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">with you again</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">so i um had to do what she said and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">there&#39;d been a big flood in brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">in southern queensland there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">and uh a huge flood all the city was</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">flooded this was about 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">and all the old people the old</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">aboriginal people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">in in the brisbane area were having</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">respiratory problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">um there and they were attributing it to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.960" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">um a disturbance in spirit in a place in</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">the mangroves</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">the the fruit bat is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">medicine for that respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">problem so this old lady had identified</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">that as a disturbance in a fruit bat</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">place and so she sent me there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">at a place called hendra</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">and so i was standing in the mangrove</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">swamp and looking across the highway</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">and there was a horse stud there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">then all the penny dropped for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">um there&#39;s a thing in australia called</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">the hendra virus</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">and the hendra virus was something</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">that um started in horses and spread</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">from the horses to the fruit bat and i</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">realized that i was a ground zero for</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">spreading of that virus it&#39;s like rabies</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">bats go nuts and then they bite people</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">and then the people get that virus you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">um so they kind of had it contained</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">apparently um anyway so i&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">at that site ground zero for the hendra</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">virus and i so i</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">i did the the ritual things and called</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">out the words that the old lady had</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">given me</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">and um and all these fruit bats that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">were roosting and this is thousands</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">roosting in the mangroves</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll just burst up into the air and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">they started their migration north early</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">too early in the season you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">idea was that they&#39;d take that bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">spirit away</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">with them anyway that sounds like a nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">intervention all the old people</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">you know i i know i heard the story that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">they were all getting better and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">respiratory problems had passed</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">and so i kept driving north because i</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:14.240" style="s2">was on my way up to the end of that song</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">line they&#39;re up in kuranda</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.240" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s a about a 3 000 kilometer</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">journey all up um so i drove all the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">up there and took my time</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">and then you know so i camped there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">i was having breakfast one morning</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">and i heard on the radio that there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">been an outbreak of hendra virus in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">where i was you know and it had never</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">spread that far north before but um</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">you know so i kind of i saw that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">know there was this custodial role</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">sort of manipulating the system somehow</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">um you know for good but then you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">it had big knock-on effects that spread</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">right across the continent</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">um you know so i&#39;m i&#39;m really careful</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">i try to be careful um with everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">that i do now</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">you know if i&#39;m taking on custodial</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.400" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">you know um in any system and of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the things we do learn in uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">complexity science and in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">our game b work i make this point again</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">the ability to predict the unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">a complex system when you tinker with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">is quite limited</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">right and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">one must proceed empirically and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">experimentally i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">at least you know make make probe</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">changes see what happens wait a bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">make another change oops that one didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">work out so well</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">try something else uh and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the danger of ideology right when</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">people come with this book</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">that says you must do all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">things everyone every jot and tittle</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">uh you can almost be sure that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">wrong and unfortunately if they</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">you know think of marxist leninism as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">example of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">right or some of this new post-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">uh crazy shit right if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">followed all their prescriptions you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">could well just uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">really put civilization uh far off its</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">uh reasonable track</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">uh you know with very little ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">recover by following</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">uh some uh ideological or utopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">too far without taking a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">a you know a live experimental and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">reaction you know action reaction adjust</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">uh approach yeah yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">i think a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">we we have all these plans you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">people always asking what&#39;s your vision</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">of the future all these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re supposed to like design the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">future you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">based on a very limited you know map of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">what we can see</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">and i think um a lot of times it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">dynamic than that you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">allow for emergence</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">you you have to um basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">you know be a caretaker of all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">conditions in the system</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">uh that will produce the emergence of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">of you know solutions and and changes in</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">um and and that&#39;s all you can do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">know i think if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">like a more like a gardener right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">that&#39;s just in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">exactly well that&#39;s a good transition</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">point to my next quote</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">from the book uh this is tyson again</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">i made a pointed parrying shield out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">fountain potential wood while thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">about all this</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">to represent the protection needed while</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">navigating the space between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">tangible</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">and intangible worlds that custodial</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">must engage with yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">you know i i can um often i&#39;ll use the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">metaphor of theory and practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">to talk about those um tangible and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">intangible worlds</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">you know so you have to engage with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">a world of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">abstract knowledge um and i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">almost a place where you can do safe to</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">experiments you know what i mean um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">you know before you you you do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to um so i talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">that metaphor is the language of spirit</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">so you&#39;re translating you know tangible</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">uh phenomena and um you know things</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">uh situations you t translating those</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">into an abstract metaphor and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">you&#39;re manipulating those in abstract</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">you know and then you complete that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">feedback loop there between those two</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">worlds by bringing them back into this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty much how ceremony and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">ritual works</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">you know and if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what mathematics is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">mathematics is is translating you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">tangible</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">uh systems into uh intangible symbols</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">and metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">and um you know manipulating those in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">that abstract space and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">you know finding solutions that you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">bring back across into the real world</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">yeah particularly certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">mathematical physics that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">maybe less so in abstract mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">where some of those guys just pride</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">themselves in living in the intangible</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">oh this doesn&#39;t have any application why</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">the hell will i think about that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">problem you have to complete that loop</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">you have to complete the loop between</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">the tangible and intangible</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">otherwise you know yeah i mean i talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">about the problems that that can</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">create you know uh in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">um and that a lot of education is set up</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">you know to just be sitting in the in</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">the practical space or just be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">the theoretical and never the twenties</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">you&#39;ll meet</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and you&#39;re yeah that&#39;s and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">close to the idea of wisdom is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">dance between the two yeah right well</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">real learning is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">is an act of creation it&#39;s so we talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">about so</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">we talk about that in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">being so the word we&#39;d use for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">today is turn around so a turnaround</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">event is is that act of creation</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s like an interaction between</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">those two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">and there has to be a feedback work loop</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">happening between that world of spirit</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">or abstract</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">and um you know tangible</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">you know physical reality and that needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">kept constantly in motion so in learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s like this miniature creation</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">event that happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">you know in your neural processes uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re closing that loop</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">and it really sparks joy but um</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">you know uh the opposite happens if</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;re just sitting in one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">it&#39;s you end up with boredom and boredom</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">is it causes brain damage it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:36.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s one thing i can say i</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.960" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">bored in my life i always find some shit</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">to get into</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.200" style="s2">right yeah well you know when you went</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">to school you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">still able to carry knives around on</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">your belt the eggs are different</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">exactly yeah indeed</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">unfortunately and that brings us to our</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">final topic uh before we wrap up here</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">uh this is again another quote on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">right on target</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">and actually trying to interact</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">you know naturally as a node in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:25.599" style="s2">complex dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">you know um as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.599" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">um you know and follow those principles</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">of interaction we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">before where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">uh you have that velocity happening in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">your exchange of uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">information and energy and resources</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">you know um that you have these</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">happening in dynamic relation with with</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">the communities that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">human and non-human communities um and i</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">and being like that then you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">consciousness is changing your your mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">is is sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">act of increase and i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the best we can do for now</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">um but try and keep some memory alive</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">try and and and notice the illusions</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">that are around you and mark those</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">things as illusions</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">and um try and keep yourself behaving in</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">some way</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:21.280" style="s2">that you can retain some kind of memory</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">of what it is to be human</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:26.480" style="s2">when all of this uh comes down because</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">it is coming down</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">you know this civilization is collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">and when it does you&#39;re going to want to</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">with the habitat and the communities and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">the massive changes that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">you&#39;re going to need to be able to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:47.520" style="s2">and um if you want to thrive</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a that&#39;s about it at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.520" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">stage</p>
