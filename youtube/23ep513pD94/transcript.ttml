<p begin="00:00:12.760" end="00:00:16.600" style="s2">intelligence series and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.889" end="00:00:18.400" style="s2">about a lot of concepts on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.600" end="00:00:20.110" style="s2">which have become quite important to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.400" end="00:00:22.330" style="s2">people trying to kind of follow the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.110" end="00:00:25.420" style="s2">thread of this conversation things like</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.330" end="00:00:27.789" style="s2">coherent sovereignty and some people</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.420" end="00:00:29.080" style="s2">talk about game B and definitely</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.789" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">collective intelligence collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.080" end="00:00:34.270" style="s2">insight and I&#39;ve kind of realized as</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing these making these</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.270" end="00:00:38.650" style="s2">making these films the a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.880" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">concepts are things that I learn from</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.650" end="00:00:46.450" style="s2">you we we go back about 10 years almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:49.000" style="s2">now and you&#39;re kind of full disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.450" end="00:00:51.370" style="s2">or a mentor to rebel wisdom your very</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:54.579" style="s2">close friend and I&#39;ve kind of realized</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.370" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">that a lot of your frameworks of looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.579" end="00:00:58.030" style="s2">at the world have kind of also become</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:59.829" style="s2">very useful and very important to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.030" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">making sense of the world and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.829" end="00:01:03.700" style="s2">they align really nicely with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:05.170" style="s2">what some of the interviewees on our</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.700" end="00:01:06.700" style="s2">channel have been talking about what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.170" end="00:01:09.130" style="s2">nature of coherent nature of collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.700" end="00:01:11.590" style="s2">intelligence what I would say is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.130" end="00:01:13.179" style="s2">of when I dig into these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.590" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">they&#39;re things that I&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.179" end="00:01:18.939" style="s2">and that I know but they&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:21.340" style="s2">gotten new names and labels recently in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.939" end="00:01:23.950" style="s2">this sense making conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.340" end="00:01:26.439" style="s2">happened so I have to kind of reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.950" end="00:01:29.859" style="s2">it a little bit reframe it used a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.439" end="00:01:31.810" style="s2">language and I just hope that I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.859" end="00:01:35.049" style="s2">come away with it with a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.810" end="00:01:37.630" style="s2">understanding and that we create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.049" end="00:01:41.859" style="s2">coherent field here and that we feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.630" end="00:01:44.289" style="s2">what is for me the real the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.859" end="00:01:47.469" style="s2">important element of measuring coherence</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.289" end="00:01:50.679" style="s2">or autonomy or sovereignty which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.469" end="00:01:52.749" style="s2">contact and once we get into contact and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.679" end="00:01:55.529" style="s2">where we&#39;re communicating from a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.749" end="00:01:59.169" style="s2">let&#39;s say real and honest perspective</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.529" end="00:02:01.299" style="s2">things emerge you know some urgent</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.169" end="00:02:02.950" style="s2">conversations happen and we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.299" end="00:02:05.679" style="s2">little experience of some collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.950" end="00:02:09.489" style="s2">intelligence right here let&#39;s do our</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.679" end="00:02:11.830" style="s2">best okay yeah and I know you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.489" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">following and listening to quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.830" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">of the other people on the channel and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:20.920" style="s2">what have you made of it so far</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:23.620" style="s2">I&#39;m really amazed at how smart some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.920" end="00:02:25.659" style="s2">these people I have to say and the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.620" end="00:02:27.640" style="s2">that they can articulate it and take it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.659" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">apart and it&#39;s like it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.640" end="00:02:33.909" style="s2">pause rewind listen again sometimes so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:35.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of intelligence I find</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.909" end="00:02:38.890" style="s2">some of it I have to listen quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.799" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">carefully to it but there is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.890" end="00:02:44.920" style="s2">sometimes use of terms like sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:46.930" style="s2">and coherence as though they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.920" end="00:02:48.939" style="s2">yeah you know I just I lost my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.930" end="00:02:51.069" style="s2">sovereignty for a moment so I&#39;m deaf to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.939" end="00:02:53.889" style="s2">go back to sovereignty or coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.069" end="00:02:55.900" style="s2">I find those from the personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.889" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">aspect and the spiritual development</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.900" end="00:03:00.970" style="s2">work that I&#39;ve done to be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:04.659" style="s2">sophisticated states in which I spent a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.970" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">lot of time kind of not working on</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.659" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">explicitly on autonomy but autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">let&#39;s say coming at becoming an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:15.790" style="s2">of a lot of other work of digesting and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:19.689" style="s2">metabolizing my own personal history</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.790" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">beliefs concepts the the cultural stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.689" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">that was put into me that I just take as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:27.729" style="s2">Road truth when I&#39;m young and trusting</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:29.799" style="s2">and as I grow up and so living in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.729" end="00:03:32.169" style="s2">life and start finding that I&#39;m running</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.799" end="00:03:36.129" style="s2">into walls then insert the question</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.169" end="00:03:38.680" style="s2">things and so I guess what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.129" end="00:03:42.629" style="s2">in general about a lot of it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.680" end="00:03:46.060" style="s2">cerebral part is really great and I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.629" end="00:03:48.760" style="s2">blessed I think and that you are able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.060" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">have these sophisticated conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.760" end="00:03:54.459" style="s2">with these people but the actual work is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:57.220" style="s2">a lot deeper than just sitting around in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.459" end="00:03:59.290" style="s2">understanding a concept because we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.220" end="00:04:01.209" style="s2">have a shadow and we do have a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.290" end="00:04:04.439" style="s2">unconscious and we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.209" end="00:04:06.729" style="s2">repressed material we&#39;ve been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.439" end="00:04:10.090" style="s2">influenced by the culture that we grew</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.729" end="00:04:14.019" style="s2">up in by the parental Society of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.090" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">parental influence and the personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.019" end="00:04:21.159" style="s2">that we developed which in my way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:24.010" style="s2">looking at things is kind of a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.159" end="00:04:26.139" style="s2">spiritual lens is not the truth of who</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.010" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">we are but to get to the truth of who we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.139" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:31.450" style="s2">have to start with where I am and where</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">I am is locked into this personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.450" end="00:04:36.730" style="s2">which behaves in a very conditioned way</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">and I have to be very curious about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.730" end="00:04:42.370" style="s2">and after you&#39;re very willing to share</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.130" style="s2">the truth as it comes up in me with</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.370" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">other people so that it it kind of gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.130" end="00:04:53.320" style="s2">metabolized as it becomes more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:55.510" style="s2">and then those terms oh this is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.320" end="00:05:00.550" style="s2">where I would be usually that say</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.510" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">completely influenced by somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.550" end="00:05:05.410" style="s2">presence and actually I&#39;m not I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">sitting here with myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.410" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">and I noticed a certain kind of autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:14.020" style="s2">then you know but it&#39;s a process and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">the day only danger I think is exposing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.020" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">people to really high level ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">then people think you know I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:25.450" style="s2">sovereignty um you know it&#39;s unto</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:27.940" style="s2">yourself and to me when I really think</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.450" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">of sovereignty at which I usually use</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.940" end="00:05:32.979" style="s2">the word autonomy rather than saw</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:36.220" style="s2">sovereignty but I see them as very</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.979" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">closely related autonomy it gives a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.220" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">little bit rounder and sovereign she</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">feels a little bit more vertical and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:46.600" style="s2">hierarchical maybe it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">related to like sovereign beings like</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.600" end="00:05:54.190" style="s2">Kings and stuff like this but the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:58.870" style="s2">thing that comes out of autonomy is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.190" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">really real human contact and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.870" end="00:06:07.229" style="s2">like more than even like spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:10.810" style="s2">enlightenment I&#39;m really craving and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.229" end="00:06:13.060" style="s2">going for real human contact in my life</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.810" end="00:06:15.700" style="s2">and that in itself turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.060" end="00:06:19.990" style="s2">spiritual and I find myself transforming</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.700" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">in that so I&#39;m not much on transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.990" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2">I find transcendence has a subtle level</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">of rejection and it may be on an overt</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:30.640" style="s2">level I&#39;m more into like having the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">truth and going into the uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.640" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">places and talking to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">good friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:41.340" style="s2">and baring our souls a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:43.140" style="s2">grinding it out I like it there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.340" end="00:06:45.060" style="s2">things that came up one was reminded</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.140" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">that a phrase that I&#39;ve heard you use a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.060" end="00:06:49.200" style="s2">few times before about the personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">but you&#39;ve got this sort of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.200" end="00:06:52.260" style="s2">between what I call the essence and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:53.820" style="s2">personality that you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">from any kind of spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.820" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">like if you look deep enough inside</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.670" style="s2">you&#39;ll find the essence and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:01.500" style="s2">various maps that talk about that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.670" end="00:07:03.990" style="s2">but I&#39;ve heard you say before that your</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.500" end="00:07:06.300" style="s2">personality is not wrong or your ego is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.990" end="00:07:07.650" style="s2">not wrong it&#39;s an intelligent strategy</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.300" end="00:07:09.810" style="s2">to survive in the environment in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.650" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">life in so it&#39;s not wrong it&#39;s just out</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.810" end="00:07:15.510" style="s2">of date which i think is sorry that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:16.770" style="s2">said your best line but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.510" end="00:07:19.140" style="s2">impressed that you remembered it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.770" end="00:07:21.870" style="s2">precisely yeah but what I love about</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.140" end="00:07:23.880" style="s2">that is that there&#39;s no rejection in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.870" end="00:07:27.180" style="s2">that because because the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">transform is to accept and the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.180" end="00:07:30.090" style="s2">of that is that if we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:31.670" style="s2">change ourselves we won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.090" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">change ourselves it only comes through</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.670" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">integrating and accepting these parts of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:39.570" style="s2">ourselves right so when I do my work I</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:41.880" style="s2">really I make that pronouncement new for</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.570" end="00:07:43.290" style="s2">me do it a number of times to a group</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.880" end="00:07:44.580" style="s2">that this is a place where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.290" end="00:07:47.190" style="s2">going to be judged</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:53.910" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve fixated in a personality</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.190" end="00:07:56.700" style="s2">and that was a confluence of many</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.910" end="00:08:00.060" style="s2">different elements from your parental</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.700" end="00:08:02.580" style="s2">your school your any traumas that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.060" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">went through whatever and you survived</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.580" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">but you fixated into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:12.270" style="s2">basically designed to avoid danger and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:15.210" style="s2">damage and further trauma in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.270" end="00:08:16.890" style="s2">environment and then we take that as who</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.210" end="00:08:19.740" style="s2">we are and that becomes what we call our</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.890" end="00:08:23.310" style="s2">ego or personality structures that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.740" end="00:08:26.100" style="s2">that we relate to and then we find that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:28.170" style="s2">it&#39;s very limited in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.100" end="00:08:30.420" style="s2">functionality it&#39;s fine if you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.170" end="00:08:33.090" style="s2">living in the same box but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.420" end="00:08:36.770" style="s2">this kind of urge and desire for more</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.090" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">you have to start taking that apart and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.770" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">the only way that I see that&#39;s effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:46.680" style="s2">for that is to not be judgmental towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:48.550" style="s2">any person wherever they find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.680" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">and I find that very easy</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.550" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">to do an endo pointer okay that was an</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:55.060" style="s2">intelligent thing to believe him when</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:57.460" style="s2">you were a kid but is it really serve</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.060" end="00:09:00.280" style="s2">you right now and then we enter into an</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.460" end="00:09:02.710" style="s2">inquiry process and we bore down into it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.280" end="00:09:04.960" style="s2">a little bit and people start to as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.710" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">become aware you start to have choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.960" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">and before you&#39;re aware we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">automatic pilot more and more robotic</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:15.580" style="s2">and we&#39;ll just do things and we fill the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:17.530" style="s2">space with you know automatic behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.580" end="00:09:19.060" style="s2">yeah I want to go back as well to what</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.530" end="00:09:21.100" style="s2">you talked about with sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.060" end="00:09:23.170" style="s2">the danger was thinking that sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.100" end="00:09:24.610" style="s2">is something simple that we can oh I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:26.590" style="s2">at my sovereignty and that you can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.610" end="00:09:28.030" style="s2">learn it or just even by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.590" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">the concept that can make some</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.030" end="00:09:33.130" style="s2">significant difference no sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">all of that it is going to be linked to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.130" end="00:09:36.820" style="s2">all of our childhood stuff all of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.930" end="00:09:40.690" style="s2">conditioning from society and from</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.820" end="00:09:42.730" style="s2">family and it&#39;s a huge huge piece it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">lifetime&#39;s work just in itself I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.730" end="00:09:48.430" style="s2">think so and I see it that way and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:50.680" style="s2">not like you suddenly arrive there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.430" end="00:09:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s done I think you can become more</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.680" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">and more sovereign or autonomous as new</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.400" end="00:09:58.990" style="s2">influences come into your field and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">challenge any old concepts or beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.990" end="00:10:03.850" style="s2">it&#39;s basically not being bound by old</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">concepts and beliefs that came from</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.850" end="00:10:10.360" style="s2">anything external to you so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">self-realized place where you sit and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.360" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">relax confidence with yourself that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:18.910" style="s2">have inside of yourself what it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:22.090" style="s2">respond to anything that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.910" end="00:10:24.760" style="s2">outside that&#39;s sovereign but when I find</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.090" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">myself losing my sovereignty when I find</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.760" end="00:10:29.620" style="s2">myself losing my grounding when I find</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:32.080" style="s2">myself in a contraction because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.620" end="00:10:34.450" style="s2">somewhere comparing myself to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.080" end="00:10:37.390" style="s2">else or somebody has criticized me or</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.450" end="00:10:41.260" style="s2">something the way to deal with it is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.390" end="00:10:44.140" style="s2">be really really curious about myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.260" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">and then with that curiosity and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.140" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">process of inquiry going into and just</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">bringing it up raising it up to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">surface whoa oh there&#39;s an old piece I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">never looked at before there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">concept and somehow it gets metabolized</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:05.050" style="s2">when it gets brought</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">responsibly and also yeah sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.050" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">and and it can be very easily I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.860" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">mistaken for yeah Armel I&#39;m sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:21.670" style="s2">man are you really yeah and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:23.500" style="s2">kind of bring something in as well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.670" end="00:11:26.200" style="s2">had that experience like becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.500" end="00:11:27.850" style="s2">curious of what what&#39;s coming up or any</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.200" end="00:11:30.820" style="s2">negative reactions or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.850" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">emotional reactions is something so I I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.820" end="00:11:34.750" style="s2">went through a period of doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.250" style="s2">transformational workshops some of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.750" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">I did with you some of them are done</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.250" end="00:11:41.050" style="s2">with various different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">facilitators and what I found after a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.050" end="00:11:44.830" style="s2">while was and I&#39;ve used this phrase on</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.470" style="s2">our workshops like becoming a detective</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.830" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">of our own experience and following the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.470" end="00:11:51.520" style="s2">thread of something would come up so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:52.779" style="s2">you&#39;re on a two or three day workshop</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.520" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">maybe someone will say something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.779" end="00:11:56.140" style="s2">sparks a thought or you&#39;ll have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:11:58.360" style="s2">experience where you&#39;ll that will simmer</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.140" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">for like a couple of days and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.360" end="00:12:02.710" style="s2">like becoming enjoying that when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">feel like oh I&#39;m feeling angry about</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.710" end="00:12:06.010" style="s2">something I&#39;m feeling touched by</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:08.230" style="s2">something getting excited about that as</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.010" end="00:12:10.330" style="s2">a as a feeling of oh wow I&#39;m ready to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.230" end="00:12:11.709" style="s2">realize something about myself and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.330" end="00:12:13.390" style="s2">following the thread and almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.709" end="00:12:15.690" style="s2">unraveling the thread of that experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.390" end="00:12:18.339" style="s2">and finding that it almost always</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.690" end="00:12:20.350" style="s2">emerges into some kind of realization oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.339" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">it was that experience that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.350" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">coming up or was that relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">I&#39;m ready to look at in a new way and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:26.950" style="s2">guess people who are not so familiar</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:30.640" style="s2">with kind of the idea of workshops I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.950" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">mean at a four or five day maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.640" end="00:12:35.050" style="s2">two day process which we&#39;ve just got a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:36.640" style="s2">chance to play with different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.050" end="00:12:40.330" style="s2">ourselves be more honest but we normally</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.640" end="00:12:42.970" style="s2">would be and yeah it&#39;s sort of a much</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.330" end="00:12:45.010" style="s2">more open space to to kind of explore</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">what&#39;s going on what what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">that that sort of sense of becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:52.209" style="s2">detective of our own experience I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:53.950" style="s2">that that&#39;s a wonderful phrase and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.209" end="00:12:57.370" style="s2">going to steal and start using it in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.950" end="00:13:03.180" style="s2">groups because I think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.370" end="00:13:06.070" style="s2">basis of inquiry and is curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.180" end="00:13:07.959" style="s2">inquiry I want to break down the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.070" end="00:13:10.300" style="s2">inquiry for a moment because I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.959" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s such an important method of self</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.300" end="00:13:15.400" style="s2">discovery inquiry literally mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:19.390" style="s2">to question and the question means I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.400" end="00:13:21.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know and to not know brings us out</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.390" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">of the kind of certainty of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.580" end="00:13:27.250" style="s2">personality structure and that lens that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">we wear so we become in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.250" end="00:13:33.100" style="s2">liminal space of not knowing them and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:35.650" style="s2">come available to truth and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.100" end="00:13:38.980" style="s2">get excited about that if we can add</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.650" end="00:13:42.190" style="s2">that element of inquiry and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.980" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">curious what&#39;s gonna happen if I follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.190" end="00:13:46.600" style="s2">this thread even it feels really</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:49.000" style="s2">uncomfortable right now or I got really</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.600" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">defensive last night but I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.000" end="00:13:54.790" style="s2">about why did I get really defensive and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:57.280" style="s2">I stay with it I really trust that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.790" end="00:13:59.010" style="s2">is has been known in humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.280" end="00:14:02.070" style="s2">psychology for a long time there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.010" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">optimising force for self-realization</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.070" end="00:14:07.780" style="s2">inside all of us and if we get aligned</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:11.200" style="s2">with that and we support that it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.780" end="00:14:12.460" style="s2">gonna bring up what we need to know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.200" end="00:14:14.020" style="s2">and one of the other things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.460" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">talked about by a lot of people is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.020" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">idea of coherence and I guess collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:21.310" style="s2">intelligence collective insight is sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.970" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">of based around that coherence but one</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.310" end="00:14:24.640" style="s2">of the mistakes I think a lot I see a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.070" style="s2">lot of people making and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.640" end="00:14:28.060" style="s2">something Jaime will mentioned to me the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.070" end="00:14:31.330" style="s2">other day and I&#39;d like to record</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.060" end="00:14:32.710" style="s2">something with him about it is this sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.330" end="00:14:34.900" style="s2">of idea that oh we can just go into</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.710" end="00:14:37.030" style="s2">coherence let&#39;s let&#39;s kind of really try</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.900" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">and go into coherence and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.030" end="00:14:41.500" style="s2">work coherence is is from what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:44.740" style="s2">understand and what I&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.500" end="00:14:48.130" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s what we it&#39;s the space we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.740" end="00:14:50.380" style="s2">get to on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.130" end="00:14:52.420" style="s2">difficult conversations or the work or</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.380" end="00:14:54.400" style="s2">the kind of once we&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.420" end="00:14:55.990" style="s2">whatever is coming up that&#39;s keeping us</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.400" end="00:14:56.770" style="s2">out of coherence then we can arrive in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.990" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.770" end="00:15:01.240" style="s2">we can&#39;t shortcut there like it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:03.550" style="s2">of emergent outcome of having done the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.240" end="00:15:05.560" style="s2">work deeply enough to be in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.550" end="00:15:07.630" style="s2">coherent space with each other do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.560" end="00:15:10.840" style="s2">agree with that totally I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.630" end="00:15:13.210" style="s2">it&#39;s another one of those kind of catch</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.840" end="00:15:15.970" style="s2">words right now that can have a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.210" end="00:15:19.450" style="s2">simplistic understanding but I see it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.970" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">an outcome and it&#39;s a it&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.450" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">interesting thing about coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">like I&#39;m Co here I can become Co here</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:30.730" style="s2">with myself by telling the truth I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:33.800" style="s2">become coherent with a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.730" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">by everybody is sharing their truth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.800" end="00:15:37.640" style="s2">we come to a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:39.710" style="s2">appreciation and single-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.640" end="00:15:42.470" style="s2">source whatever you want to call it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.710" end="00:15:45.830" style="s2">level of contact with each other but</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:47.510" style="s2">we&#39;re not the same and there&#39;s there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.830" end="00:15:49.670" style="s2">a kind of coherence where everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.510" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">listens to a piece of music and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.670" end="00:15:54.050" style="s2">they become coherent you know on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">wavelength level that can be measured by</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.050" end="00:15:58.820" style="s2">heart math or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:02.360" style="s2">the coherence that I&#39;m thinking of in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.820" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">more active group is everybody is in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">into their in their truth and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:10.580" style="s2">sitting in their truth as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:13.610" style="s2">and out of that comes a space that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.580" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">very tangible that I that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.610" end="00:16:18.620" style="s2">exciting also because we&#39;re on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.630" style="s2">of something we&#39;re in contact every it</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.620" end="00:16:22.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re in agreement doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.630" end="00:16:25.610" style="s2">mean we&#39;re saying the same thing but</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.600" end="00:16:29.450" style="s2">everybody&#39;s opened themselves up and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.610" end="00:16:31.820" style="s2">I think that the real doorway to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.450" end="00:16:34.910" style="s2">coherence is telling the truth and being</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.820" end="00:16:36.680" style="s2">honest yeah and that kind of goes in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.910" end="00:16:37.880" style="s2">out as well like it&#39;s speaking the truth</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.680" end="00:16:40.010" style="s2">but it&#39;s also being alive to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.880" end="00:16:42.020" style="s2">emerging in ourselves and wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.010" end="00:16:45.800" style="s2">known because I&#39;d say if anything as</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.020" end="00:16:49.430" style="s2">fueled the growth of rebel wisdom so far</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.800" end="00:16:52.040" style="s2">in its it&#39;s the it&#39;s that we&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.430" end="00:16:53.780" style="s2">live out those values like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.040" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve internalized those values over a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.780" end="00:16:56.690" style="s2">long time with being in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:16:58.970" style="s2">workshops together and seeing the effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.690" end="00:17:00.350" style="s2">of that speaking the truth how it kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.970" end="00:17:03.350" style="s2">of creates more flow and creates more</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:05.870" style="s2">contact and more connection is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.350" end="00:17:07.699" style="s2">live that out in our in our interactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.870" end="00:17:09.589" style="s2">with each other knowing if something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.699" end="00:17:12.199" style="s2">coming up which is a practice I do with</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.589" end="00:17:14.420" style="s2">Allie all the time at Allie also trained</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.199" end="00:17:16.670" style="s2">with you quite a bit and that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.420" end="00:17:18.800" style="s2">something is kind of coming up for each</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.670" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">of us we try and clear it and we try and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.800" end="00:17:22.370" style="s2">keep the field as clean as possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:23.420" style="s2">between us the field the concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.370" end="00:17:24.530" style="s2">field I think there&#39;s something I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.420" end="00:17:29.000" style="s2">to go into as well because I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.530" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really useful but I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:35.210" style="s2">anything hos yeah I think that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.530" style="s2">is kind of coming across in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.210" end="00:17:37.410" style="s2">work that we&#39;re doing and in the energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.530" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">of the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.410" end="00:17:42.060" style="s2">that we&#39;re putting out from the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.700" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">courses to the to the videos to it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.060" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">that that we&#39;re trying to live out and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:49.380" style="s2">do the work that we&#39;re kind of making</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:52.290" style="s2">the films about as well yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.380" end="00:17:54.630" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be having the success and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.290" end="00:17:56.820" style="s2">the following of people if that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.630" end="00:17:59.310" style="s2">coming across if you were just working</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.820" end="00:18:04.290" style="s2">with abstract ideas and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.310" end="00:18:06.510" style="s2">another headspace to behold but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.290" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">that you guys actually share and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.510" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">personal and it&#39;s embodied and you walk</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.890" style="s2">the talk in your life gives you some</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.720" style="s2">gravitas that makes the whole thing go a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:19.670" style="s2">bit deeper and I wanted to say as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.720" end="00:18:23.340" style="s2">like I think you have a very direct an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.670" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">intuitive grasp of where we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.340" end="00:18:26.520" style="s2">in terms of like where the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.780" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">and what it&#39;s missing because I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.520" end="00:18:29.820" style="s2">you sort of say this before it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:31.710" style="s2">we just keep going there from from here</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.820" end="00:18:34.290" style="s2">and we see that playing out in so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.710" end="00:18:35.850" style="s2">areas from politics to business to like</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.290" end="00:18:38.070" style="s2">this it&#39;s just heady</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.850" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">intellectual and it&#39;s sort of playing</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.070" end="00:18:41.940" style="s2">out what&#39;s the deeper layer that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:45.210" style="s2">experienced that you think is missing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.940" end="00:18:47.300" style="s2">the world well it touches a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.210" end="00:18:50.340" style="s2">points what you&#39;re saying right now but</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.300" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">one place I would go to it is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.340" end="00:18:55.710" style="s2">difference between connection and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:57.450" style="s2">contact connection can happen very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.710" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">easily and it can be we can feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.450" end="00:19:01.620" style="s2">connected because we belong the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:05.070" style="s2">political party or we endorse the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.620" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">ideas etc etc and we feel connected and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.070" end="00:19:08.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a nice feelings better than feeling</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:11.340" style="s2">disconnected we could cause those</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.520" end="00:19:14.820" style="s2">friends etc but you don&#39;t really come</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.340" end="00:19:17.040" style="s2">into the dimension of real contact until</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:19.860" style="s2">you really like kind of naked with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.040" end="00:19:22.230" style="s2">truth with another person and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.860" end="00:19:24.500" style="s2">what I think needs to happen so we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.230" end="00:19:27.000" style="s2">to get out of hiding behind the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.500" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">polarizations and identifications that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.000" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">we have in politics and so only when</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">you&#39;re we really start telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">that really the solutions that can come</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:38.850" style="s2">through are greater than the sum of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">parts because I think we have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.850" end="00:19:44.310" style="s2">possibility of tremendous intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">and wisdom arising from us but we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.310" end="00:19:49.620" style="s2">to go to a place inside of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.900" style="s2">where it can come forth and so far what</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.620" end="00:19:53.420" style="s2">we mostly have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.900" end="00:19:55.700" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know I&#39;ve been waiting for</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.700" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">know there&#39;s thesis antithesis and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.370" end="00:20:02.059" style="s2">supposedly synthesis is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.110" end="00:20:03.800" style="s2">out of it it just doesn&#39;t happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.059" end="00:20:06.500" style="s2">like the polarities just gets stronger</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.800" end="00:20:10.870" style="s2">and more entrenched in their ideologies</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.870" end="00:20:20.360" style="s2">lot of these people are doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.250" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in in the group space where</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.360" end="00:20:27.020" style="s2">we&#39;re really honoring people to open up</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:30.200" style="s2">in the way that they do can give birth</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.020" end="00:20:32.750" style="s2">to a collective intelligence that will</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.200" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">start to come forth with new ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.750" end="00:20:36.800" style="s2">will attract other people and people</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:41.210" style="s2">will come together to live and with</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.800" end="00:20:43.820" style="s2">different values and change can happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.210" end="00:20:46.750" style="s2">because and right now I feel it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.820" end="00:20:48.650" style="s2">know it&#39;s really time for some change</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.750" end="00:20:52.220" style="s2">and I want to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.650" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">the men&#39;s work because you&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.220" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">kindly mentoring us and the men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:57.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing retreats for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">of years that started various kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.559" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">separately from the media channel as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:04.280" style="s2">sort of separate strand of a rebel</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.690" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">wisdom I&#39;ve got a couple of questions I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.280" end="00:21:08.900" style="s2">mean the first one is why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">what do you think is necessary but what</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.900" end="00:21:14.120" style="s2">is men&#39;s what&#39;s required from men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.970" end="00:21:18.770" style="s2">now and is any different from when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.120" end="00:21:22.390" style="s2">were growing up I mean we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.770" end="00:21:22.390" style="s2">in a kind of very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.809" end="00:21:28.160" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s happening around</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:31.340" style="s2">gender which makes it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.160" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">delicate but in essence I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.340" end="00:21:38.330" style="s2">same you know and I I think because I</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:41.390" style="s2">still I lead these groups called essence</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:42.950" style="s2">of masculine and feminine and I start</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.390" end="00:21:45.590" style="s2">off and I put it in a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.950" end="00:21:47.030" style="s2">historical context I talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.590" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">women&#39;s movement and how much it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.030" end="00:21:51.380" style="s2">affected me and what I went through</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:53.690" style="s2">during that time and then I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.380" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">what I see happening right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.690" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">gender world and then I say but and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">going to use a very binary language</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:05.570" style="s2">model to teach what I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">important here but my vision is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.570" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">bigger and broader than that but then in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:15.289" style="s2">that binary one is really to look at and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:18.679" style="s2">see if we can bring a state and find the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.289" end="00:22:20.809" style="s2">state of relaxed confidence for a man as</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.679" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">a man and the state of relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.809" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">confidence for a woman in her feminine</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:30.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say you know and then being home</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:32.389" style="s2">there yes some people might be wondering</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.590" end="00:22:34.100" style="s2">what does that even mean what does it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.389" end="00:22:35.809" style="s2">mean to be at home in your male side and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.100" end="00:22:37.070" style="s2">how would what would it mean not to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.809" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">at home there and how would you get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.070" end="00:22:42.769" style="s2">be at home well what it would mean to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">not be there would be that I would I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.769" end="00:22:48.379" style="s2">would not be grounded I would be in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:51.379" style="s2">mind I would be compensating for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.379" end="00:22:55.809" style="s2">feeling of deficiency as a man I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.379" end="00:22:59.559" style="s2">have received a wound not literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.809" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">castration but figuratively and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.559" end="00:23:05.090" style="s2">energetically I would be castrated I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">be cut off from my male essence and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.090" end="00:23:12.110" style="s2">would be probably stuck in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:14.899" style="s2">boyish mentality which was out trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.110" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">please and damage control the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.899" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">environment is particularly women in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:21.980" style="s2">order that nothing bad would happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:24.049" style="s2">which almost always ensures that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.980" end="00:23:25.970" style="s2">something bad will happen because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.049" end="00:23:29.629" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything that women hate more</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.970" end="00:23:31.460" style="s2">than men who act like boys so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.629" end="00:23:34.669" style="s2">getting a man to deal with his own</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:38.990" style="s2">personal issues and I find in men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.669" end="00:23:41.870" style="s2">you know men can come to that place</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.990" end="00:23:44.600" style="s2">where they feel something that they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.870" end="00:23:47.299" style="s2">definitely identify as this is my</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.600" end="00:23:49.610" style="s2">masculine essence I can feel it and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.299" end="00:23:52.669" style="s2">can feel it in you I can feel it in me I</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.610" end="00:23:54.350" style="s2">and I love it and they have to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.669" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">through a bit of a process to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.350" end="00:23:59.860" style="s2">through that the same on the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:24:02.360" style="s2">side feminine the wound is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.860" end="00:24:05.090" style="s2">castration but you could use the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.360" end="00:24:08.450" style="s2">castration but it&#39;s more devaluation and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.090" end="00:24:10.070" style="s2">feel the feminine has been devalued for</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:15.040" style="s2">really really a long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.070" end="00:24:17.330" style="s2">and so women out of their intelligence a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.040" end="00:24:20.300" style="s2">lot of times and because of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.330" end="00:24:23.720" style="s2">devaluation to the feminine just became</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.300" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">better men than the men and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.720" end="00:24:28.460" style="s2">masculine side took over and it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:30.860" style="s2">something called animus possession and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.460" end="00:24:35.180" style="s2">they&#39;re you know faster smarter quicker</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.860" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">better than any guy and going to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.180" end="00:24:41.690" style="s2">healing of the loss of value in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:45.080" style="s2">feminine is a very beautiful journey and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.690" end="00:24:48.050" style="s2">I love to be as a man I love to be able</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.080" end="00:24:50.600" style="s2">to hold this male space be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.050" end="00:24:53.810" style="s2">this male space and be able to work with</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.600" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">women and help them move into allowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.810" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">themselves to feel comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:02.060" style="s2">their own femininity and express it</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:04.730" style="s2">however it wants to come across you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.060" end="00:25:07.130" style="s2">and and then the conversation that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.730" end="00:25:09.260" style="s2">happen between men and women so in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.130" end="00:25:11.180" style="s2">last few months that there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.260" end="00:25:13.460" style="s2">been a sort of trajectory on the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.180" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been on as the channel and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.460" end="00:25:18.230" style="s2">also this sense of a lot of people on a</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:23.660" style="s2">thinking of in particular focused a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:25.280" style="s2">on what is wisdom how how does that fit</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.660" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">together with like cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.280" end="00:25:32.060" style="s2">he&#39;s now honing in a lot on what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:35.570" style="s2">might call into subjective dialogue the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.060" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">sort of because he sees the what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.570" end="00:25:39.050" style="s2">lost from the sort of Greek philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:41.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve kept a lot of kind of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.050" end="00:25:43.160" style="s2">but what we&#39;ve lost is because actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.300" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">philosophy for them as a process of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.160" end="00:25:48.710" style="s2">discovering the truth together and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.780" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of words for it into</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.060" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">of the key ingredients that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:12.170" style="s2">do them I think that that self-discovery</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.700" end="00:26:15.530" style="s2">process is something that has some key</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.170" end="00:26:18.350" style="s2">components to it that can be taught and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.530" end="00:26:20.750" style="s2">it takes a little bit of time to get it</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.350" end="00:26:22.450" style="s2">and one I spoke about already is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.750" end="00:26:25.610" style="s2">curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.450" end="00:26:27.860" style="s2">it takes courage damn those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.610" end="00:26:29.779" style="s2">conversations so you might have to work</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.860" end="00:26:33.350" style="s2">through your issues around curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.779" end="00:26:36.500" style="s2">your issues around courage it takes a</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.080" end="00:26:44.179" style="s2">been raised in the fixation of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.539" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">personality and it takes that and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.179" end="00:26:49.370" style="s2">takes curiosity as I would say with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:52.639" style="s2">five main elements that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.370" end="00:26:56.690" style="s2">active inside of somebody to be really</p>
