<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">okay back</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">shift like i said let this foot slide a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">bit if you need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">don&#39;t put too much pressure on your knee</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">or your head and then up and over</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">see how i actually lift it off the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">ground get it into position</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">and then forward and push this heel back</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">a little bit if i need to so i get it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">back to the 45 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">i&#39;ll do it two more times on each side</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">and then we will move to this practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">back pivoting</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">okay i hope that&#39;s helpful review and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">eventually we&#39;re going to add in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">arms and i&#39;ll show you what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">not because i expect you to practice it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">because just get the get the footwork</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">down is really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">so how we actually start in the practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">is we start with this foot at the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">foot</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">at the 45 degrees to the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">and just on the ball of the foot behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">the toes here</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">and we get we turn our we turn to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">right this hand comes in front</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2">this hand comes up and forward like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">back align</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.160" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">shift back right</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">um it takes time uh because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">learning a practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">that is has been designed over centuries</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">uh to really engage the cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">cortex loop</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">and give you a practice that will induce</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">and absorption and also</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">self-defense</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">okay so that helps to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">between your sitted practice and your</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">this because we have to pursue long-term</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">goals or in a developmental trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">the inner sage reminds you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">that you are not to be finally</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">identified with your narratives</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">that beyond the autobiographical self</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">there is the ontological self the inner</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">sage</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">directs you off of the autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">and onto the owner&#39;s manual if i can put</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">it that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">and not as just an act of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">as an act of identification</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">you start to find the home for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">in the ontology of your of your being</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">rather than in the narrative and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">what all these practices are doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">they&#39;re getting you to become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">all the levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">all the layers</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">of who and what you are how you emerge</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">of the of the environment and your body</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:48.240" style="s2">and your mind and your spirit</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">by that i mean your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.240" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">self-transcendence i don&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">bringing those all into an aligned</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">awareness which of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">means aligning the four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">so that they are actively mutually</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">affording each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">creates a different sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">identification</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">that gives us a space of freedom from</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">not to despise them or dispense with</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">but to no longer be confused with them</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">so that they lose some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">the way they can cut us and catch us</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s when the inner sage comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">into your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">it is the inner sage is offering you a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:43.240" style="s2">new way of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">and right as i said rather than just the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.240" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">autobiographical self</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">we&#39;re now talking about the ontological</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">and this is the self that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">the stoics will argue is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">how we respond to the sufferings of life</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">the stoics will argue that this we</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">we have to do our best and morally and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">right and as much as we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">and unfolding this but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">our ability to alter the world is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">very small compared to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">our ability to transform</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">who would what we are ontologically we</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">we do stoicism</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">good to have you here</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">during meditative questing i always go</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">down to a rabbit hole with a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">negative experiences which i would</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">rather like to forget</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">any ideas on how to approach regretful</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">painful memories</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">well first of all um they you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">keep remembering them because they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">not been fully processed</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.919" style="s2">this is sort of a standard almost cliche</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">but i think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">uh a valuable psychodynamic trip um</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">there more processing needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">that material um</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">it needs to go from being always relived</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:13.760" style="s2">to remembered when needed</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">and so part of what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.760" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">remember when i talked about encoding</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">specificity that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">not only remember the event or the facts</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">and this also relates to what i just</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">said about stoicism by the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">we also remember deeply the state of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">being we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">in when we&#39;re remembering this fact or</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">that event</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s why stoicism paying more</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">attention to the state of being</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">is ultimately where you have the most as</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">epictetus as</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">the most control but</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">back to rainer&#39;s point so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">often the way we try to learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">from a situation that&#39;s painful is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">we learn it using some very primitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">primitive forms of processing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">very you know automatic reactive</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">processing and then and then how we try</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">to learn our lesson is we learn it with</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">and with guilt and guilt is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">psychological pain</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">we inflict on ourselves we basically are</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">punishing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">to try and direct our behavior now</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">you you know there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">start has to start at that level because</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">we&#39;re not initially</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">linguistic beings we&#39;re not a list</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">initially rationally reflected beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">etc but what this tradition</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">proposes is can you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">bring up the painful situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">perhaps by being in a stance of meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">towards it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">and then instead right</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">instead of trying to avoid the guilt can</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">you transmute it can you let the guilt</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">come up</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">and then instead of trying to get away</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">from it or trying to instantly resolve</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">open up the processing and try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">replace the guilt with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">transmuted don&#39;t replace it sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">was a mistake on my part</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">you want to transmute it into</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">what&#39;s called intelligent regret if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">were trying to correct</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">the behavior of a good friend</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t hurt them to correct their</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">or you try to minimize the hurt you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">inflict pain or even guilt on them</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">other than the minimal force desire to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">bring about</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">recognition and response minimal force</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">required to bring about recognition and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">so the guilt is there to help get you</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">you recognizing and responding</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">but that&#39;s not enough to finish the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">process you bring in intelligent regret</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">what do you do with your friend you try</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">to open up their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">you try to explicate you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">this sit in the larger context</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">what you try to do is replace a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">primitive and childish state of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">that is your recognition and response of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:14.799" style="s2">the event that is painful</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">with an adult recognition and response</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.799" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">to the event that is painful</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">so you need to process these and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">kind of processing isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">processing the facts it&#39;s processing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">you we</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">all we all need to do this you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">grow up</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">chore in how you are recognizing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">responding</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">yes the pain and the guilt get you into</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">the initial recognition and response</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">but then move into intelligent regret</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">talk to yourself talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">talk to yourself as you would to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">a beloved friend this is kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">going on in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">what&#39;s called um internal family systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">uh therapy and what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">basically are growing up</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">of i found this in myself at least when</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">i was learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a resistance to this precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">because it gets me</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">out of my head and there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t want to get out of my head</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">because i like being in my head because</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">john is so</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">smart right and look at all the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">john can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">and look at how he can you know make</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">people smile at him and he&#39;s so clever</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">and getting out of that especially into</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">john&#39;s kind of clumsy as he&#39;s moving in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">his body</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s really where he&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s really the depths of his being i</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">but it was ultimately so good for me</p>
