<p begin="00:00:06.260" end="00:00:10.740" style="s2">James is a real pleasure to have you on</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">the channel great to be here thanks so</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.740" end="00:00:14.130" style="s2">much I&#39;m looking forward to it yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:16.409" style="s2">really love to explore a few of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.130" end="00:00:17.999" style="s2">topics that we&#39;ve talked about quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.409" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">bit on the channel and I know that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.999" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">your work touches on as well and one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">the big topics and seems to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">quite strongly is the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:31.309" style="s2">meaning crisis that we&#39;re in a feigning</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">crisis and also my perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.309" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">one of the one of the factors in that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">that culturally I worked in the media</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:41.219" style="s2">for many years and was sort of very well</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">aware of the kind of might call it a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.219" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">stranglehold that the new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:48.620" style="s2">worldview in particular had on culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">and media and that seems to be shifting</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.620" end="00:00:53.519" style="s2">quite noticeably that they don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">be the force that they used to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.519" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">culture what&#39;s your kind of overall take</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.620" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">on the meaning crisis and where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:05.190" style="s2">sort of culturally right now yeah by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">way I agree I think it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.190" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">see the sort of fading star of New</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">Atheism in that regard uh and in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">sense though why someone like Richard</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">Dawkins seems as loud as ever but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:19.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually a sign of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">frustration on his part that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.890" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">he can&#39;t believe that he&#39;s not getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">the cultural uptake that he would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:29.910" style="s2">expected and and yet I think he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:34.440" style="s2">getting the cultural uptake that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.910" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">expected because he doesn&#39;t he offers</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.440" end="00:01:39.440" style="s2">such a flattened view of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">be human do you know there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.440" end="00:01:47.480" style="s2">that it all it offers is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">self-congratulation of enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.480" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">then what do you mean like it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:56.970" style="s2">there&#39;s just not a way of life a vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:58.800" style="s2">for the fullness of being human so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.970" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">think in some sense it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.800" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">speak to really deep human hungers that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">we can&#39;t sort of face and we might try</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">to write over them but they are still</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">there so I&#39;m I&#39;m really intrigued by</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">this notion of the meaning crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">think that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to speak into with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">latest book on the road with Saint</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">Agustin because I think that he&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:29.020" style="s2">in a moment of what I call cracks in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:31.390" style="s2">secular where a narrative that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.020" end="00:02:33.400" style="s2">been sort of telling ourselves in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.390" end="00:02:35.710" style="s2">ways for a couple of hundred years in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.400" end="00:02:37.210" style="s2">other ways for a couple of generations a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.710" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">story that we&#39;ve been trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.210" end="00:02:45.610" style="s2">ourselves a hasn&#39;t worked has generated</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">rampant loneliness social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.610" end="00:02:54.820" style="s2">depression anxiety and and yet we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">feel like it should be otherwise it this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.820" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t the way it&#39;s supposed to be and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m I I think it&#39;s a really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:10.330" style="s2">moment to be at the sort of waning end</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:13.209" style="s2">of a very flat secularizing tale even</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.330" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">though I don&#39;t have any illusions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.209" end="00:03:18.910" style="s2">there being some like glorious other</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">hegemonic narrative that emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.910" end="00:03:23.380" style="s2">the process I think it&#39;s some I love it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.790" end="00:03:25.150" style="s2">that that people seem to be having</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.380" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">conversations that we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.150" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">imagined twenty years ago in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:32.980" style="s2">is that is that your experience as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">like you&#39;re seeing openness and hunger</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">that maybe was sort of suppressed almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">before yes yeah definitely it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">like a certain kind of narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:48.730" style="s2">visibly failing more and more readily</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:50.650" style="s2">and I just wanted to go back to what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.730" end="00:03:52.780" style="s2">said before what what what is your sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.650" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">of what is that narrative that you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.780" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">is I can&#39;t remember your exact words but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:58.180" style="s2">you said something similar that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.670" style="s2">there is a sense that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.180" end="00:04:03.580" style="s2">narrative that hasn&#39;t worked how do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.670" end="00:04:05.800" style="s2">summarize that particular narrative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.580" end="00:04:09.970" style="s2">and me and maybe it&#39;s not just one thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.800" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to oversimplify but I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.970" end="00:04:16.419" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple facets of a dominant</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:20.049" style="s2">story that people have been told they</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.419" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">ought to live in to one aspect of it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.049" end="00:04:27.479" style="s2">I think the sort of enlightenment piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:27.479" style="s2">of it right that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.699" end="00:04:35.009" style="s2">the most important thing is to be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:38.910" style="s2">smartest person in the room and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.009" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">means a lying yourself with a very sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.910" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">of narrow vision of what counts as</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">rationality so I think one one thread or</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.600" style="s2">stream of that story has been a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.949" style="s2">reductionistic account of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.600" end="00:04:57.000" style="s2">to be rational and and to be rational</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.949" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">then would require almost undoing all</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.000" end="00:05:02.340" style="s2">kinds of aspects that we kind of in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">gut know are part of being human so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.340" end="00:05:08.490" style="s2">think that&#39;s part of it I would probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">also say and I&#39;ll be really intrigued to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.490" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">hear your your thoughts on this I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:24.060" style="s2">a story of autonomy and independence</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.630" end="00:05:26.820" style="s2">that has made it my sole responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.060" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">to make up a story for myself does that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.820" end="00:05:29.669" style="s2">make sense do you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:32.849" style="s2">in other words I think we&#39;ve inherited</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.669" end="00:05:34.979" style="s2">and and I grant I&#39;m speaking from an</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.849" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2">American context and I know that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.979" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">will be some differences with the UK but</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:42.449" style="s2">I do think in in the West generally</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:46.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve ended up with this narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.449" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">says you could be whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.380" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">there is no normative good there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:54.659" style="s2">specified good that you need to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:56.190" style="s2">towards which sounds liberating I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.659" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">I get why that sounds Liberator</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.190" end="00:06:02.159" style="s2">okay so nobody&#39;s going to tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:04.919" style="s2">to do until you are left with the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.159" end="00:06:10.380" style="s2">sheer burden and responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.919" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">making up something and I think that can</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.380" end="00:06:16.979" style="s2">be its own prison I think that can end</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.210" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">up being its own chain where now the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.979" end="00:06:21.990" style="s2">burden is on me to be so innovative</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:25.380" style="s2">and so unique and special and come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.990" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">with this story but it&#39;s also exhausting</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.380" end="00:06:34.979" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s and and we at the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:37.740" style="s2">time we are being sold a version of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.979" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">to buy that way of life so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a weird way in which I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:42.360" style="s2">consumer</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">capitalism kind of plays into this myth</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.360" end="00:06:46.020" style="s2">of autonomy and independence and that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">have to make up our own story what I see</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.020" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">in young people I&#39;m a university</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:50.970" style="s2">professor so I you know work with 20</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:57.540" style="s2">year olds all the time but what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.970" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">just an increased exhaustion with its I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.540" end="00:07:01.710" style="s2">say burden it&#39;s it&#39;s not because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.580" end="00:07:07.889" style="s2">want to be irresponsible is just because</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something that enslaving about</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.889" end="00:07:13.310" style="s2">such a narrative and they&#39;re actually I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:16.320" style="s2">find people more and more hungry to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.310" end="00:07:18.410" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t want you to take away my</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.320" end="00:07:21.780" style="s2">freedom I don&#39;t want you to take away my</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:25.200" style="s2">agency my burden but could you give me</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.780" end="00:07:27.630" style="s2">some hints about what a good life might</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.200" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">look like and maybe there are other</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.630" end="00:07:35.940" style="s2">people around that could help me live</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:38.100" style="s2">alongside rather than just as this</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.940" end="00:07:40.139" style="s2">autonomous independent individual I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:44.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s the other the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.139" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">the autonomy narrative is not just the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.120" end="00:07:48.620" style="s2">burden of having to make it up so to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">speak it&#39;s also just the utter</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.620" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">atomization and isolation that comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.690" end="00:07:57.810" style="s2">from oh well I&#39;m I&#39;m in charge of myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.930" end="00:08:01.260" style="s2">but that also means I&#39;m not with people</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.810" end="00:08:05.789" style="s2">and other people almost are portrayed as</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.260" end="00:08:08.010" style="s2">this kind of you know thefts thief&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.789" end="00:08:09.900" style="s2">my autonomy and independence and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.010" end="00:08:12.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a terrible way to try to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.900" end="00:08:14.039" style="s2">human seems to be yeah you know there</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.630" end="00:08:16.740" style="s2">were a few things that came up while you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.039" end="00:08:20.220" style="s2">were what you were talking that remind</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.740" end="00:08:22.260" style="s2">me of so one of the the first the origin</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.220" end="00:08:25.349" style="s2">of rebel wisdom was very much looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:26.220" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s thought and he there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.349" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">are a few things that you said that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.220" end="00:08:32.520" style="s2">really sort of map onto a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:35.820" style="s2">things one of which is the idea he talks</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.520" end="00:08:38.400" style="s2">about Nietzsche and Jung I know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.820" end="00:08:40.260" style="s2">Nietzsche effectively said okay so god</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.400" end="00:08:42.330" style="s2">is dead we&#39;ve got rid of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.260" end="00:08:44.459" style="s2">narratives which gave us meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.330" end="00:08:46.860" style="s2">gave us a direction and we will have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.459" end="00:08:47.970" style="s2">create our own and this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.860" end="00:08:49.980" style="s2">think that you&#39;re saying it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.970" end="00:08:51.810" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;ve got rid of all of the all</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.980" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">of the traditional ways of being so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.810" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">we&#39;re now faced</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:58.620" style="s2">to be autonomous and to create our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:09:00.209" style="s2">meaning and then Peterson&#39;s reading of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.620" end="00:09:03.089" style="s2">young is that young then came along and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.209" end="00:09:04.829" style="s2">said not so fast we can&#39;t we are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.089" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">those kind of creatures we cannot create</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.829" end="00:09:09.209" style="s2">our own meanings and we are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">mythologies we are embedded and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.209" end="00:09:12.570" style="s2">archetype to be embedded in deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.430" style="s2">stories whether we like it or not and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.570" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">they&#39;re actually part of our you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.430" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">go as deep as you can go or if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.190" style="s2">actually part of our physiology learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:22.140" style="s2">out of our and we&#39;re impersonating</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.190" end="00:09:23.910" style="s2">stories and we&#39;re impersonating things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.140" end="00:09:27.269" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.910" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">I saw a your I saw your lecture you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.269" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">we are what we love yeah you are we you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:33.570" style="s2">know yeah oh yeah we&#39;re you seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">saying very much the same thing that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.570" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">lot of the things that we are acting out</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:41.130" style="s2">in our lives we&#39;re not fully aware of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:42.839" style="s2">when they&#39;re far beyond the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.130" end="00:09:44.610" style="s2">sort of conscious thought but we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.839" end="00:09:46.890" style="s2">acting out patterns and orey&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.610" end="00:09:49.620" style="s2">beliefs and ideas that are very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.890" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">deep is that does that scan for you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.620" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">yeah absolutely in fact I was also</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:57.660" style="s2">thinking of you mentioned that you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:59.610" style="s2">just in Toronto and one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.660" end="00:10:01.860" style="s2">novelists is a Canadian novelist named</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.610" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">Robertson Davies who is actually a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.860" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">young devotee and and it just strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:12.810" style="s2">and you see it in the novels of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:15.660" style="s2">Robertson Davies to be human is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.810" end="00:10:20.279" style="s2">storied creature dude I mean like I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.660" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">when if we are beset by identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">politics today I think I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">all kinds of reasons to be frustrated by</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">that but I think it&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:33.930" style="s2">outworking of the fact that people need</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:37.140" style="s2">to know who they belong to and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.930" end="00:10:39.420" style="s2">story they fit into in order to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.140" end="00:10:41.490" style="s2">sort of motivation and meaning and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.420" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">even if I might be frustrated with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.490" end="00:10:46.410" style="s2">way it manifests I still see behind it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:48.149" style="s2">deep hunger and desire and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:50.070" style="s2">manifestation of the fact that to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.149" end="00:10:52.140" style="s2">human is to be storied we are narrative</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.070" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">and probably the best definition or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.140" end="00:10:57.480" style="s2">best defense of identity politics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">ever heard yeah I mean it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.480" end="00:11:01.170" style="s2">like I wanna I wanna meet even the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:03.510" style="s2">things that frustrate me I want to meet</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.170" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">sympathetically and I do think like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.510" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">just said and as young as is pointing</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.619" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:13.589" style="s2">what if it is the case that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.619" end="00:11:17.309" style="s2">are made in such a way are wired in such</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.589" end="00:11:19.439" style="s2">a way are scripted in such a way that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.309" end="00:11:21.629" style="s2">fact we can&#39;t realize the fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.439" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">being human without honoring some</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.629" end="00:11:26.129" style="s2">feature of ourselves I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:31.069" style="s2">that is is noting that we are narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.129" end="00:11:36.419" style="s2">animals and I think it&#39;s also why mass</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.069" end="00:11:38.339" style="s2">consumer culture can exploit us as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.419" end="00:11:42.049" style="s2">though do you know to mean because in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.339" end="00:11:44.759" style="s2">some ways I think I think marketing</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.049" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">understands that we are narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.759" end="00:11:50.879" style="s2">creatures better than the university</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:54.269" style="s2">better than the church to be honest and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.879" end="00:11:57.989" style="s2">and in that sense they actually play on</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.269" end="00:12:00.749" style="s2">our deep hunger for story and narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.989" end="00:12:04.139" style="s2">and to live into something to become a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.749" end="00:12:06.509" style="s2">character in a drama but then they they</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.139" end="00:12:10.979" style="s2">utilize that for the sake of selling us</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.509" end="00:12:15.569" style="s2">crap and and so that&#39;s that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.979" end="00:12:17.249" style="s2">cynical deployment of who we are whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.569" end="00:12:20.519" style="s2">I think what you&#39;re saying what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.249" end="00:12:25.579" style="s2">suggesting is maybe one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.519" end="00:12:28.619" style="s2">why the experiment of this utterly</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.579" end="00:12:31.919" style="s2">nihilistic Nietzschean project doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.619" end="00:12:34.169" style="s2">work is because you just can&#39;t overwrite</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.919" end="00:12:36.089" style="s2">the palimpsest of the human heart which</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.169" end="00:12:40.289" style="s2">is sort of longing for some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.089" end="00:12:42.929" style="s2">fullness something more and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.289" end="00:12:44.549" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m intrigued I mean I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.929" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">think we lived in a mixed reality where</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.549" end="00:12:48.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are still</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:52.379" style="s2">imagining that&#39;s a possible way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.319" end="00:12:57.019" style="s2">it but I guess I&#39;m I&#39;m more intrigued by</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.379" end="00:12:57.019" style="s2">the symptoms of exhaustion and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.559" end="00:13:02.970" style="s2">scrambling for people to say there&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.569" end="00:13:06.899" style="s2">to be a better way to do this in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.970" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">so yeah just to say that we are in it to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.899" end="00:13:12.329" style="s2">say we are what we love is to also</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:15.659" style="s2">recognize that our loves are susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.329" end="00:13:17.359" style="s2">to narrative formation which means that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.659" end="00:13:19.280" style="s2">they&#39;re also susceptible to narrative</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.359" end="00:13:22.010" style="s2">deformation</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.280" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">and I think becoming aware of that gives</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.010" end="00:13:29.870" style="s2">us again gives us back some agency so</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:32.300" style="s2">that I can see oh it&#39;s almost like my</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.870" end="00:13:34.970" style="s2">eyes open and now I see I see what a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">mass consumer culture is trying to do to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.970" end="00:13:38.330" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:40.310" style="s2">what would it look like for me to become</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.330" end="00:13:42.050" style="s2">intentional and I think this is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.310" end="00:13:43.790" style="s2">about what your whole project is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.050" end="00:13:46.010" style="s2">what does it look like for me to become</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.790" end="00:13:48.500" style="s2">just much more aware and intentional</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.010" end="00:13:49.730" style="s2">about how to pursue a good life I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.500" end="00:13:51.650" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.730" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">this whole the very fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.650" end="00:13:55.820" style="s2">having this conversation is such an</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:58.250" style="s2">encouraging sign of our cultural moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.820" end="00:14:01.070" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.250" end="00:14:03.200" style="s2">different points to pick up here the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.070" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">the one thing I think would unite just</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.200" end="00:14:09.080" style="s2">about everyone that we&#39;ve had on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:10.700" style="s2">channel is that they&#39;re all engaging</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.080" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">with these deeper questions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.700" end="00:14:16.700" style="s2">some realization that we&#39;ve gone we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">gone wrong in terms of you could call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.700" end="00:14:19.880" style="s2">the materialist paradigm you could call</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">it the secular paradigm you could call</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.880" end="00:14:23.750" style="s2">it and you look at the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.010" end="00:14:26.210" style="s2">everywhere from kind of the opiate</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.750" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">crisis to the various sort of types of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.210" end="00:14:33.890" style="s2">what I&#39;d call kind of soul sickness that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:36.500" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing around the West but the key</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.890" end="00:14:37.670" style="s2">the key question is I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.500" end="00:14:39.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a realize there&#39;s a common</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.670" end="00:14:43.490" style="s2">realization that we need something in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.650" end="00:14:45.350" style="s2">the place where religion used to be but</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.490" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">but the open question is like from</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.350" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">Jonathan page I would say yes and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:56.120" style="s2">Chris yeah it&#39;s true it&#39;s religion I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">guess playing sort of slightly yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.120" end="00:14:59.510" style="s2">the word my question would be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">guessing that you would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.510" end="00:15:02.450" style="s2">Jonathan Fazio it&#39;s like no we have good</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:04.670" style="s2">religious traditions we just need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.450" end="00:15:06.980" style="s2">renew them is it realistic that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.670" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">Christianity could be renewed or could</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.980" end="00:15:13.190" style="s2">be could come back in a meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:16.190" style="s2">or that&#39;s the question I guess yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.190" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">so and this is no this is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.190" end="00:15:21.050" style="s2">conversation we should have so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">also a philosopher so when you ask me a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.050" end="00:15:24.140" style="s2">question what is realistic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:27.140" style="s2">immediately wondering what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.140" end="00:15:30.380" style="s2">conditions of realism are right so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.140" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">you ask is it realistic I&#39;ll just tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.380" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">you from where I sit</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:37.890" style="s2">let&#39;s remember I believe in a God who</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:41.290" style="s2">raises the dead so anything is possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.890" end="00:15:43.510" style="s2">but I do think this is the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.290" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">and I am by the way I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.510" end="00:15:47.710" style="s2">can prove anything in this regard so</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:50.530" style="s2">let&#39;s just think about how one could</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.710" end="00:15:53.530" style="s2">even have the conversation or discern on</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.530" end="00:15:56.290" style="s2">this matter it seems to me I agree that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.530" end="00:15:59.170" style="s2">I think we see people who are realizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.290" end="00:16:00.610" style="s2">okay know I need something more lastly</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.170" end="00:16:03.340" style="s2">something else there&#39;s to be a better</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.610" end="00:16:08.170" style="s2">vision for how to be human</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.340" end="00:16:10.450" style="s2">I need meaning I think when people</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.170" end="00:16:14.500" style="s2">entertained the impossibility of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.450" end="00:16:17.320" style="s2">religion first of all I understand it 80</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.500" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">80 percent of it I totally get a tee</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.320" end="00:16:25.060" style="s2">percent of religion is worth leaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">right to mean one way to think about say</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.060" end="00:16:30.190" style="s2">that the difference between Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:34.930" style="s2">and you know Russell Brand or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.190" end="00:16:36.370" style="s2">who I love so many ways you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.930" end="00:16:42.400" style="s2">we agree about a lot more than we</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.370" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">disagree is what vision for a way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.400" end="00:16:55.510" style="s2">life will offers a gift and doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:57.430" style="s2">ask more of you do you know me and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.510" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">others that I think so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.430" end="00:17:04.060" style="s2">alternatives to I&#39;ll say Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:06.870" style="s2">which is my confession I think so many</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.060" end="00:17:09.790" style="s2">of the alternatives to Christianity are</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.870" end="00:17:13.570" style="s2">they have a religious dynamic about them</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.790" end="00:17:17.430" style="s2">but they are also kind of threatened to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.570" end="00:17:21.670" style="s2">eat me alive because they still are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.430" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">putting our expecting me to perform can</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.670" end="00:17:26.050" style="s2">you give an example of what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:30.810" style="s2">yeah what kind of you told me yeah geez</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.050" end="00:17:33.400" style="s2">or about what ideologies or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.810" end="00:17:36.370" style="s2">ideologies will be one example think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.400" end="00:17:37.780" style="s2">even like let&#39;s just say and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.370" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">want to offend anybody with this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.780" end="00:17:40.520" style="s2">just an example that comes with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:44.210" style="s2">let&#39;s take walk</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.520" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">as kind of I do think that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.210" end="00:17:49.490" style="s2">somebody said okay there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:51.920" style="s2">more I&#39;m going to devote myself to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.490" end="00:17:54.170" style="s2">cause of justice which of course we</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.920" end="00:17:55.880" style="s2">should all be devoted to but then what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.170" end="00:18:01.580" style="s2">happens is it turns into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.880" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">performative dynamic where really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.580" end="00:18:05.059" style="s2">still an act of self invention on my</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:08.780" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.059" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a confidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.780" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">in human willpower and I guess one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:18.710" style="s2">the reasons why I follow someone like</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">Saint Agustin is because I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">what I think realistic set of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">expectations about human willpower and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:28.370" style="s2">what I can accomplish and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">accomplish and instead it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.370" end="00:18:33.050" style="s2">the alternative that Christianity holds</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:34.730" style="s2">out isn&#39;t just meaning it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.050" end="00:18:37.720" style="s2">meaning but the alternative that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.730" end="00:18:41.210" style="s2">Christianity holds out is scandalous</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.720" end="00:18:44.630" style="s2">because it&#39;s called grace it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.210" end="00:18:51.950" style="s2">gift it&#39;s it&#39;s a devotion to a God who</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.630" end="00:18:55.309" style="s2">gives himself away and I I think um I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.950" end="00:18:57.530" style="s2">think sacrifice is at the heart of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.309" end="00:19:00.770" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.530" end="00:19:02.179" style="s2">and I think one of the I guess one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.770" end="00:19:04.460" style="s2">the distinguishing characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.179" end="00:19:08.030" style="s2">Christianity is that it is not just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.460" end="00:19:12.170" style="s2">God who calls us to sacrifice but it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.030" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">a God who sacrificed himself and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.170" end="00:19:18.170" style="s2">from that flows a gift of a grace that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:20.620" style="s2">is a gift now I say that&#39;s scandalous</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.170" end="00:19:24.500" style="s2">because I do think probably the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.620" end="00:19:27.350" style="s2">bastion of our autonomy is always the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.500" end="00:19:30.950" style="s2">pride that imagines we can do this on</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.350" end="00:19:34.520" style="s2">our own it&#39;s one of the reasons why I</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.950" end="00:19:37.429" style="s2">just find myself like kind of Alcoholics</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:39.710" style="s2">Anonymous or the 12-step programs so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.429" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">was just gonna say in fact um as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.710" end="00:19:43.790" style="s2">been working on st. Augustine this this</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:46.250" style="s2">new book on the road was st. Agustin the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.790" end="00:19:49.730" style="s2">thread that I kept kept coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.250" end="00:19:52.660" style="s2">our recovery communities and and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.730" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">so intriguing in recovery communities is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.660" end="00:19:57.070" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">come to an end of yourself there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.070" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">actually a really remarkable book you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">might enjoy by a writer named Leslie</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">Jamison called the recovery we just sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:08.530" style="s2">of hurt inside her account of both</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:10.180" style="s2">addiction and recovery but she also</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.530" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">looks at different writers literary</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.180" end="00:20:14.710" style="s2">writers who&#39;ve grappled with that and at</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">one point she says you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.710" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">terrible things about addiction is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:23.620" style="s2">narrows your repertoire to this very</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.680" end="00:20:26.500" style="s2">restricted set of desire use repeat</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.620" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">desire use repeat and what the addict</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.500" end="00:20:32.200" style="s2">really needs liberation from is what she</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:37.060" style="s2">calls the claustrophobic crawl space of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.200" end="00:20:38.590" style="s2">the self and I I guess what I what work</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.060" end="00:20:41.590" style="s2">that worries me but I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:45.130" style="s2">contrasts so many other modes of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.590" end="00:20:46.630" style="s2">making from the religious is they still</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.130" end="00:20:48.550" style="s2">feel like they are dependent on that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.630" end="00:20:50.410" style="s2">claustrophobic crawl space of the self</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.550" end="00:20:53.230" style="s2">there&#39;s still at least there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.410" end="00:20:56.020" style="s2">lot of options that are saying I can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.230" end="00:20:58.570" style="s2">this or we can do this whereas I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.020" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">what Christianity talks about is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.570" end="00:21:05.230" style="s2">drama in which a God gives himself to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:07.560" style="s2">bring us to the end of ourselves which</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.230" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">is then finding the new grace of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.560" end="00:21:13.180" style="s2">dependence that&#39;s that&#39;s scandalous to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:15.570" style="s2">the autonomous mind right that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.180" end="00:21:20.620" style="s2">dependence could be a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.570" end="00:21:22.690" style="s2">liberation but I do think I guess I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.620" end="00:21:26.050" style="s2">wonder if that is what is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.690" end="00:21:30.370" style="s2">distinctive and sustaining because it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.050" end="00:21:33.130" style="s2">also translates into a deeply communal</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:35.050" style="s2">vision right like now again there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.130" end="00:21:37.080" style="s2">all kinds of forms of Christianity which</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.050" end="00:21:41.320" style="s2">I just sort of privatized me and Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.080" end="00:21:43.780" style="s2">autonomous yes I have zero interest in</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.320" end="00:21:47.530" style="s2">those and this is 90 percent of American</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.780" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">Christianity let&#39;s be honest but but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.530" end="00:21:52.030" style="s2">think at the heart of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:54.160" style="s2">Christian vision this this Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.030" end="00:21:56.200" style="s2">vision if you will that you see in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.160" end="00:21:58.420" style="s2">someone like st. Agustin is this deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.200" end="00:22:00.580" style="s2">communal picture Agustin at one point</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.420" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">says I could not be happy without</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.580" end="00:22:09.309" style="s2">friends there&#39;s this this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:12.759" style="s2">sense in which the self is porous</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.309" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s an opening for others to come</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.759" end="00:22:20.919" style="s2">in and actually well they could steal</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:22.749" style="s2">from me or they can fuel me and one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.919" end="00:22:25.299" style="s2">the things I think that that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.749" end="00:22:27.639" style="s2">encouraged by in things like rebel</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.299" end="00:22:29.769" style="s2">wisdom and other sorts of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.639" end="00:22:33.309" style="s2">happening is they are deep communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.769" end="00:22:35.139" style="s2">do you know like these are um I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.309" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">it&#39;s really clear that people find a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.139" end="00:22:40.899" style="s2">belonging there and I would just say</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:43.299" style="s2">that what is built into the drama of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.899" end="00:22:46.779" style="s2">Christian narrative is an account of why</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.299" end="00:22:48.909" style="s2">we need to belong but it&#39;s a belonging</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.779" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">that also isn&#39;t just about what am I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.909" end="00:22:54.460" style="s2">getting out of this it&#39;s what am I being</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:54.940" style="s2">called to and I think it&#39;s a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.460" end="00:22:57.789" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.940" end="00:23:00.549" style="s2">you mentioned kind of woke as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.789" end="00:23:03.249" style="s2">particular kind of narrative or ideology</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.549" end="00:23:05.379" style="s2">or perspective and that reminded me I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.249" end="00:23:08.229" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not an original insight a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.379" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">people have made this this point I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.229" end="00:23:15.249" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard Sam Harris make it before</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">maybe Douglas Murray that there is for</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.249" end="00:23:20.019" style="s2">example in kind of woke culture what</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:22.869" style="s2">they call council culture nowadays we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.019" end="00:23:25.330" style="s2">got sin and we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.869" end="00:23:27.820" style="s2">sort of sense of almost like a semi</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">religious narrative but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.820" end="00:23:32.139" style="s2">redemption so this idea that you make a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:33.999" style="s2">tweet sort of ten years ago you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.139" end="00:23:36.309" style="s2">apologized for it but you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.999" end="00:23:39.009" style="s2">you&#39;re still a sinner and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.309" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">like the danger I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.009" end="00:23:43.509" style="s2">are feeling with these modern ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:45.820" style="s2">there they seem to be parasitical on</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.509" end="00:23:47.859" style="s2">religion but they don&#39;t have the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.820" end="00:23:50.950" style="s2">there&#39;s no place for redemption for</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.859" end="00:23:52.239" style="s2">example yes yes yes there&#39;s no end I one</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.950" end="00:23:58.379" style="s2">of the things that has struck me is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.239" end="00:24:01.229" style="s2">there is no time for repentance right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.379" end="00:24:03.759" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no room for forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.229" end="00:24:07.269" style="s2">because you are just supposed to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.759" end="00:24:08.769" style="s2">mastered the requisite orthodoxy and if</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.269" end="00:24:12.369" style="s2">you haven&#39;t mastered the requisite</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.769" end="00:24:14.169" style="s2">orthodoxy then you&#39;re canceled but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.369" end="00:24:16.629" style="s2">also and this is true I think especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.169" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">in kind of social media spaces there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.629" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">intolerance for giving people the space</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.120" end="00:24:29.550" style="s2">and time to change their minds and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:32.250" style="s2">grow it&#39;s like no you are you either</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.550" end="00:24:35.070" style="s2">reflect whatever what we all think now</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.250" end="00:24:39.300" style="s2">or you don&#39;t and that&#39;s your right I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:42.420" style="s2">think it&#39;s acidic on religion it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.300" end="00:24:45.240" style="s2">little bit like sin without absolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.420" end="00:24:50.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s a bit like having confession</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.240" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">but actually no space for repentance now</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.040" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">I I think that also stems from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:25:00.180" style="s2">again there&#39;s still something so</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">self-generated about all of this so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.180" end="00:25:06.030" style="s2">it comes from a space of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:08.970" style="s2">self-righteousness and therefore doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.030" end="00:25:11.690" style="s2">really have room for grace grace grace</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.970" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">is just the Christian word for</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.690" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">everything is gift do you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:24.180" style="s2">like I I&#39;m I&#39;m a receiver I&#39;m indebted</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:26.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s not an accomplishment on my</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.180" end="00:25:27.900" style="s2">part and I think what worries me and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.430" end="00:25:30.420" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t pick you know cuz when I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.900" end="00:25:33.030" style="s2">when I say whoa culture that might sound</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.420" end="00:25:36.390" style="s2">like I&#39;m picking on the left heaven</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.030" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">knows that the right has its own forms</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.390" end="00:25:39.270" style="s2">of this and and in our in our context in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:41.220" style="s2">the States</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.270" end="00:25:44.780" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s another version of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.220" end="00:25:47.910" style="s2">being American that is as intolerant of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.780" end="00:25:49.590" style="s2">and giving room people people room in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.910" end="00:25:51.570" style="s2">that regard so no I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.590" end="00:25:54.980" style="s2">what worries me most about that is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.570" end="00:25:59.070" style="s2">confidence in one&#39;s own enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.980" end="00:26:00.390" style="s2">self sufficiency and purity I this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.070" end="00:26:03.960" style="s2">another reason actually that&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.390" end="00:26:07.110" style="s2">Augusta and interests me is because we</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:10.830" style="s2">live woke culture canceled culture is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.110" end="00:26:15.960" style="s2">also a purity culture it exhibits</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.830" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">remarkable self confidence in our having</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.960" end="00:26:22.020" style="s2">mastered what we ought to be where as</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:24.870" style="s2">Agustin who&#39;s a Christian bears witness</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.020" end="00:26:27.420" style="s2">to he has no illusions of purity do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.870" end="00:26:33.000" style="s2">mean that&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s no illusions</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.420" end="00:26:33.740" style="s2">of my achieving purity there&#39;s instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.000" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:39.980" style="s2">deep appreciation for the messiness of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:43.940" style="s2">my own motives and I find that more</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.980" end="00:26:47.210" style="s2">liberating then the burden of being pure</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.940" end="00:26:49.730" style="s2">which i think is just doomed to cynical</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.210" end="00:26:51.740" style="s2">hypocrisy at some point you&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.730" end="00:26:53.870" style="s2">sent a gust in a few times I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.740" end="00:26:56.300" style="s2">hugely familiar with him as a sir</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">because he very interested in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.300" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">st. Augustine for dummies why do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:02.929" style="s2">think he&#39;s so significant and what what</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:07.429" style="s2">what are the key things to know about</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.929" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">him as a historical figure yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.429" end="00:27:14.270" style="s2">baseline biography so san agustin lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:19.780" style="s2">in the late 300s and early 400s in North</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.270" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">Africa is raised in a sort of mix of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.780" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">pagan Roman and African Christian home</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:27.500" style="s2">his mother is st. Monica which is a name</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:32.179" style="s2">that some people will recognize Santa</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.500" end="00:27:34.520" style="s2">Monica he&#39;s most famous for a work</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.179" end="00:27:37.790" style="s2">called the confessions which some people</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">referred to as like the first memoir in</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.790" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">the West I actually think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:46.610" style="s2">complicated but what would he tell what</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">the drama that he unfolds in his</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.610" end="00:27:50.780" style="s2">confessions is basically a drama of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.220" end="00:27:53.420" style="s2">looking for love in all the wrong places</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.780" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">I mean in something in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.420" end="00:28:00.980" style="s2">first half of Augustine&#39;s Confessions is</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:02.600" style="s2">the is the narrative of a soul looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.980" end="00:28:04.370" style="s2">for meaning do you mean that he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.600" end="00:28:05.750" style="s2">on this quest any and he tries to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.370" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">one of the things that intrigues me</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.750" end="00:28:09.650" style="s2">about Agustin is he&#39;s so perennial and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.540" style="s2">in some ways so contemporary because</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.650" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">where does he look for meaning he looks</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.540" end="00:28:20.540" style="s2">for meaning in education sex power</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:23.870" style="s2">enlightenment political influence</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.540" end="00:28:26.750" style="s2">you know Fame I mean he&#39;s in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.870" end="00:28:30.110" style="s2">all the places that we still look for</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.750" end="00:28:32.120" style="s2">sort of substitutes for meaning Agustin</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.110" end="00:28:34.790" style="s2">tried all of those now there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.120" end="00:28:38.030" style="s2">of caricatures of Agustin out there you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.790" end="00:28:39.950" style="s2">know the inventor of original sin hated</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.030" end="00:28:42.440" style="s2">sex all these kind of things and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.950" end="00:28:44.419" style="s2">there&#39;s I mean there&#39;s parts of Agustin</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.440" end="00:28:47.299" style="s2">we would want to deconstruct what I find</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.419" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">fascinating about him is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.299" end="00:28:50.989" style="s2">he&#39;s a figure that basically tried all</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:54.499" style="s2">the things that we keep trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.989" end="00:28:58.190" style="s2">he sort of lived out this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.499" end="00:28:59.690" style="s2">playboy pursuit and then came to the end</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.190" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">of it and realized there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.690" end="00:29:05.690" style="s2">more to it man but he was also an</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:09.049" style="s2">incredible psychologist of the human</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">heart and and his confessions is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.049" end="00:29:16.879" style="s2">this deep introspective dive into well</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:19.659" style="s2">his hungers like what what am I looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.879" end="00:29:21.619" style="s2">for how am I trying to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.659" end="00:29:24.710" style="s2">interesting I think one of his most</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.619" end="00:29:26.929" style="s2">enduring gifts just to the Western</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.710" end="00:29:28.759" style="s2">intellectual tradition as a whole is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.929" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">reflection on the nature of freedom so</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.759" end="00:29:32.299" style="s2">so related very much to conversations we</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:35.769" style="s2">were having before about autonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.299" end="00:29:39.109" style="s2">independence Agustin thinks freedom</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.769" end="00:29:42.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t just freedom of choice it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.109" end="00:29:46.129" style="s2">just multiplying your options free true</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.230" end="00:29:49.460" style="s2">freedom is empowerment for the good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.129" end="00:29:55.149" style="s2">actually a gifted agency so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.460" end="00:29:57.950" style="s2">chase and become what I&#39;m made to be and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.149" end="00:29:59.720" style="s2">III think his analysis feels very</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:01.850" style="s2">contemporary when I read it in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.720" end="00:30:04.629" style="s2">regard well I was reminded of there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.850" end="00:30:08.059" style="s2">that there&#39;s quite a similarity in many</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.629" end="00:30:11.779" style="s2">in as a Sloot pattern of behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.059" end="00:30:12.789" style="s2">also in some religious tales of the man</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.779" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">who has everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.789" end="00:30:16.789" style="s2">realizing it&#39;s not sufficient and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:19.639" style="s2">then hasn&#39;t having some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.789" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">religious conversion I&#39;m thinking of but</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.639" end="00:30:22.789" style="s2">the story of the Buddha is very similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:26.210" style="s2">in that the Buddha had everything and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.789" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">then yeah one of my favorite poet John</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.210" end="00:30:30.739" style="s2">Donne mmm if you&#39;re familiar with oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:32.119" style="s2">yeah absolutely he was a very similar it</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.739" end="00:30:32.840" style="s2">was a very similar story right he was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.119" end="00:30:35.629" style="s2">Playboy</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.840" end="00:30:36.950" style="s2">he was a kind of a successful out</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.629" end="00:30:39.559" style="s2">heiress to crass and then towards the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.950" end="00:30:44.029" style="s2">end of his life became deeply religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.559" end="00:30:45.499" style="s2">and then became Archbishop of Canterbury</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.029" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">I think towards the end of his life so</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.499" end="00:30:52.429" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a mellow trajectory to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:54.200" style="s2">of lives it seems and and it it it</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.429" end="00:30:57.940" style="s2">undercuts one of the dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.200" end="00:31:01.670" style="s2">narratives of religion as crutch or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.940" end="00:31:04.970" style="s2">substitute or something only insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.670" end="00:31:07.100" style="s2">this is not people trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.970" end="00:31:09.080" style="s2">something by means of their religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.100" end="00:31:11.300" style="s2">because they actually had achieved</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.080" end="00:31:14.750" style="s2">everything that one had hoped for it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.300" end="00:31:17.720" style="s2">actually seeing through that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">realizing that that was almost a screen</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.720" end="00:31:21.680" style="s2">to what was really ultimate and what was</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:25.040" style="s2">really significant you know the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.680" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">thing I think is important I say in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.040" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">agustín but I would also just say in</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:33.370" style="s2">sort of historic Christianity is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:37.730" style="s2">isn&#39;t even just about achieving a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.370" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s not even just believing</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.730" end="00:31:44.870" style="s2">in something different it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:50.060" style="s2">actually being able to give myself over</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.870" end="00:31:55.610" style="s2">to rituals rhythms practices liturgies</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.060" end="00:31:57.920" style="s2">in which I in a way I give myself over</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.610" end="00:31:58.760" style="s2">to the narrative even on the days I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.920" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">don&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.760" end="00:32:04.580" style="s2">even even on the days I&#39;m not sure about</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:07.000" style="s2">it even on the days I maybe don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.580" end="00:32:09.350" style="s2">suspicious of it but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.000" end="00:32:13.190" style="s2">this is why again I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.350" end="00:32:15.950" style="s2">communal there&#39;s there is what Agustin</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.190" end="00:32:20.420" style="s2">points to is Christianity as a practiced</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.950" end="00:32:23.620" style="s2">way of being together and that that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.420" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">dynamic of ritual I think also speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.620" end="00:32:28.820" style="s2">human hungers right that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:34.360" style="s2">yes it&#39;s not just that I need a better</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.820" end="00:32:34.360" style="s2">story to believe about myself I need</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.420" end="00:32:42.110" style="s2">tangible visceral tactile kinesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.420" end="00:32:45.050" style="s2">rhythms and rituals so that that story</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.110" end="00:32:46.540" style="s2">sinks into my bones and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.050" end="00:32:49.100" style="s2">something that I&#39;m processing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.540" end="00:32:52.250" style="s2">intellectually and and this again to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.100" end="00:32:55.130" style="s2">parallel it&#39;s a lot like a a it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.250" end="00:32:57.860" style="s2">like recovery in which the point of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.130" end="00:32:59.690" style="s2">going to meaning is not to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.860" end="00:33:01.280" style="s2">information do you mean like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.690" end="00:33:03.080" style="s2">going oh okay I&#39;m gonna go to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.280" end="00:33:06.650" style="s2">meeting with my notebook and tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.080" end="00:33:11.240" style="s2">things you you don&#39;t do you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.650" end="00:33:14.029" style="s2">writer David Foster Wallace yes so in</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.240" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">his novel Infinite Jest actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.029" end="00:33:19.309" style="s2">recovery house is a really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">important scene and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.309" end="00:33:23.509" style="s2">point where a character realizes</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.919" style="s2">somebody tells this addict in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.509" end="00:33:27.409" style="s2">recovery house who thinks he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.919" end="00:33:30.859" style="s2">think his way out of his problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.409" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">the the counselor says to your best</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.859" end="00:33:36.289" style="s2">thinking got you here so you&#39;ll be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:38.450" style="s2">you you all you&#39;re thinking got you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.289" end="00:33:40.609" style="s2">was your enslavement to your addiction</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.450" end="00:33:43.309" style="s2">you you actually aren&#39;t going to think</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.309" end="00:33:48.979" style="s2">going to practice your way to different</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.759" end="00:33:51.049" style="s2">thinking and I I don&#39;t know even as</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.979" end="00:33:54.950" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s who literally makes his</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.049" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">life as an intellectual as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.950" end="00:33:59.229" style="s2">I I think it&#39;s really really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:02.239" style="s2">that for me the Christian life is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.229" end="00:34:05.089" style="s2">actually a script of how to live</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.239" end="00:34:07.309" style="s2">together in practice in community and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.089" end="00:34:09.980" style="s2">that reminds me of something about</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.309" end="00:34:16.069" style="s2">something more fundamental than my</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.980" end="00:34:19.510" style="s2">thinking which is my loving yeah I I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.069" end="00:34:22.220" style="s2">love to for a lot of people kind of who</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.510" end="00:34:23.960" style="s2">are not Christians or not sort of deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.220" end="00:34:26.539" style="s2">involved in these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.960" end="00:34:28.490" style="s2">the whole sort of Christian</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.539" end="00:34:30.230" style="s2">denominations and the different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.490" end="00:34:30.950" style="s2">movements around Christianity is very</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.230" end="00:34:33.500" style="s2">confusing</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.950" end="00:34:37.129" style="s2">sure did you tell me what your</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.500" end="00:34:38.839" style="s2">particular denomination is and why does</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.129" end="00:34:40.819" style="s2">it differ from the from the others and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.839" end="00:34:42.020" style="s2">correct remarks maybe you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.819" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">why you&#39;re one is right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.020" end="00:34:50.029" style="s2">wrong I wouldn&#39;t do that yeah I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:51.619" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be pedantic either cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.029" end="00:34:56.119" style="s2">so I&#39;m not sure where your listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.619" end="00:34:59.059" style="s2">of course the the two great sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.119" end="00:35:01.099" style="s2">streams in Christianity are most</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.059" end="00:35:04.309" style="s2">fundamentally divided between east and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.099" end="00:35:07.700" style="s2">west and Jonathan paggio who we said</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.309" end="00:35:10.069" style="s2">before represents Eastern I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.700" end="00:35:12.140" style="s2">Western Christian tradition and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.069" end="00:35:14.809" style="s2">within that Western and of which</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.140" end="00:35:16.970" style="s2">Augustine is kind of the founding father</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.809" end="00:35:20.180" style="s2">if you will of Western Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.970" end="00:35:23.869" style="s2">which becomes Roman Catholicism and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.180" end="00:35:25.910" style="s2">in the 1500s you get the Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.869" end="00:35:27.890" style="s2">Reformation which is ah but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.910" end="00:35:31.220" style="s2">what&#39;s important I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.890" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">that that should be understood as either</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.220" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">a revolution or a fundamental rejection</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.090" end="00:35:39.260" style="s2">of that Western quote/unquote Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:42.050" style="s2">tradition it&#39;s a reform movement within</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.260" end="00:35:44.030" style="s2">it in fact what&#39;s interesting this might</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.050" end="00:35:46.070" style="s2">be more than you care about but the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.030" end="00:35:49.160" style="s2">Protestant reformers Martin Luther John</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.070" end="00:35:50.630" style="s2">Calvin they were all readers of st.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.160" end="00:35:52.280" style="s2">Augustine and in a way what they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.630" end="00:35:55.460" style="s2">doing is they were going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.280" end="00:35:57.620" style="s2">founding father to renew the Western</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.460" end="00:36:00.980" style="s2">tradition so my Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.620" end="00:36:02.600" style="s2">grows out of that Augustinian renewal</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.980" end="00:36:04.940" style="s2">movement that we call the Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.600" end="00:36:07.880" style="s2">Reformation so I&#39;m part of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.940" end="00:36:09.470" style="s2">the Dutch Reformed stream which is which</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.880" end="00:36:10.970" style="s2">will sound odd because my name is Smith</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.470" end="00:36:13.130" style="s2">and I live in the United States but</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.970" end="00:36:15.320" style="s2">there&#39;s one of the fascinating things</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.130" end="00:36:17.870" style="s2">about Christianity is what how</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.320" end="00:36:19.550" style="s2">significant immigration patterns are in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.870" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">migration patterns are to where</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.550" end="00:36:25.220" style="s2">Christian streams go so I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">an unapologetic Protestant but I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.220" end="00:36:32.810" style="s2">Protestant of a Catholic flavor that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:36.230" style="s2">I see myself in continuity with and very</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.810" end="00:36:37.880" style="s2">much indebted to this deep heritage of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.230" end="00:36:39.170" style="s2">the tradition and one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.880" end="00:36:41.870" style="s2">important things that I think has</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.170" end="00:36:45.530" style="s2">happened in Protestantism over the past</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.870" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">even just 40 or 50 years is we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.530" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">realized there were versions of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.390" end="00:36:55.300" style="s2">Protestant Reformation and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:59.240" style="s2">Enlightenment that cut us off from</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.300" end="00:37:01.010" style="s2">pre-modern wisdom and sources because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.240" end="00:37:03.290" style="s2">bought into a narrative of chronological</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.010" end="00:37:05.360" style="s2">snobbery in which we thought the newer</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.290" end="00:37:06.980" style="s2">was always better and I think we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.360" end="00:37:08.930" style="s2">through that so there&#39;s been there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.980" end="00:37:12.020" style="s2">been I think Christianity&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.930" end="00:37:14.510" style="s2">reckoning with meaning and and late</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.020" end="00:37:16.130" style="s2">modernity and I think for those of us in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.510" end="00:37:20.060" style="s2">Protestant Christian traditions that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.130" end="00:37:23.030" style="s2">meant realizing oh we threw overboard a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.060" end="00:37:24.200" style="s2">lot of gifts of ancient wisdom so one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.030" end="00:37:26.150" style="s2">the reasons why I want to write this</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.200" end="00:37:29.600" style="s2">book on st. Augustine was to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:33.650" style="s2">say man we can go back to this ancient</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.600" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">African and find it&#39;s like he&#39;s reading</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.650" end="00:37:39.850" style="s2">our mail today so the the reason why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:43.180" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.850" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">Protestant tradition is because I also</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.180" end="00:37:48.100" style="s2">think that there&#39;s room for reform and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:49.990" style="s2">renewal within Christianity I&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.100" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">say my stream I&#39;m not gonna make the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.990" end="00:37:54.910" style="s2">argument for why my why my stream is</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">best I I don&#39;t not even sure I believe</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.910" end="00:37:57.730" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:38:01.860" style="s2">you know I would just how deep sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.730" end="00:38:04.150" style="s2">with sort of Anglican Episcopalian</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.860" end="00:38:06.370" style="s2">renditions of Christianity as well I</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.150" end="00:38:09.790" style="s2">will say one thing that it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.370" end="00:38:13.480" style="s2">to my tradition is how and why</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.790" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">Christianity was actually liberating for</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.480" end="00:38:19.270" style="s2">women&#39;s voices and witness so so one</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">reason why I could never become a Roman</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.270" end="00:38:25.150" style="s2">Catholic is because for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:29.140" style="s2">what one of the renewals that happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.150" end="00:38:32.650" style="s2">was a recognition of women&#39;s gifts so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.140" end="00:38:34.660" style="s2">that they can serve fully and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.650" end="00:38:37.420" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really really important</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.660" end="00:38:40.360" style="s2">manifestation of a Christian impetus you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.420" end="00:38:44.050" style="s2">your listeners might not know that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.360" end="00:38:46.780" style="s2">first people that the resurrected Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.050" end="00:38:47.260" style="s2">appeared to to bear witness to him were</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.780" end="00:38:54.490" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.260" end="00:38:56.500" style="s2">and that was a revolutionary endeavor so</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:38:59.980" style="s2">to speak and so I I&#39;m trying to live</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.500" end="00:39:01.630" style="s2">into that a little bit right and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.980" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">wanted to ask you very quickly I want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.630" end="00:39:05.490" style="s2">move on to practice because you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:07.210" style="s2">mentioned practice moving really really</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.490" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">important part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.210" end="00:39:12.370" style="s2">becoming more and more important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:14.350" style="s2">something that I think everyone who has</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.370" end="00:39:15.880" style="s2">been sort of following this this this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.350" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">a growing conversation is now getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.880" end="00:39:20.020" style="s2">more and more into okay what are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:22.060" style="s2">practices what&#39;s in media he&#39;s out into</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.020" end="00:39:23.650" style="s2">our lives just before we go into that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.060" end="00:39:27.370" style="s2">I&#39;d like to ask you about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.650" end="00:39:28.780" style="s2">Pederson because know I talked to Paul</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.370" end="00:39:31.180" style="s2">Van de Clare a couple of times about</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.780" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">this and he said that he&#39;s had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.180" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">people coming to his church who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.450" style="s2">pretty much interested in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">because of watching Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.450" end="00:39:42.580" style="s2">legends and he&#39;s been the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:44.080" style="s2">high-profile ambassador for a for at</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.580" end="00:39:46.660" style="s2">least taking these religious story</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.080" end="00:39:50.050" style="s2">seriously have you looked much of his</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.660" end="00:39:51.550" style="s2">work and what have you made some what</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.050" end="00:39:53.720" style="s2">one of the things that complicates it a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.550" end="00:39:56.359" style="s2">little bit is so I&#39;m a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.720" end="00:39:58.270" style="s2">my training and my training is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.359" end="00:40:00.200" style="s2">in what we call continental philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.270" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.200" end="00:40:07.130" style="s2">complicates it is Peterson has a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:11.450" style="s2">tendency to make claims about figures</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.130" end="00:40:13.220" style="s2">that I know well professionally and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.450" end="00:40:16.580" style="s2">don&#39;t buy his take on it do you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.220" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">what I mean so like I find myself just</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.580" end="00:40:20.510" style="s2">slightly rolling my eyes at the way he</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:21.980" style="s2">trots out Jacques Derrida or cultural</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.510" end="00:40:25.490" style="s2">Marxism and things like that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.980" end="00:40:29.180" style="s2">partly a professional frustration if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.490" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">will yeah but I totally and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.180" end="00:40:36.830" style="s2">little bit of a way in which within</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:40.730" style="s2">Canada maybe in particular he got hooked</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.830" end="00:40:42.680" style="s2">up with a certain kind of public agenda</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.730" end="00:40:46.940" style="s2">that I just didn&#39;t excite me that much</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.680" end="00:40:51.170" style="s2">all that said I do I totally understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.940" end="00:40:56.390" style="s2">and and see how he&#39;s clearly speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.170" end="00:41:00.410" style="s2">a deep hunger for this meaning making as</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.390" end="00:41:04.700" style="s2">you said it and so I&#39;m I&#39;m I see us</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.410" end="00:41:07.330" style="s2">trying to sort of bear witness to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.700" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">fullness of being human in the wake of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.330" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">secularism failure and and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">sense you know I&#39;m sympathetic I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:17.180" style="s2">a little bit concerned if I can be sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.780" style="s2">of honest about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.180" end="00:41:24.680" style="s2">the one thing that makes me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.780" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">cautious is how gendered the response to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.680" end="00:41:30.520" style="s2">Jordan Peterson seems to be and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:34.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t claim to be an expert at all but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.520" end="00:41:37.010" style="s2">I&#39;m somebody who wants to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.220" end="00:41:39.470" style="s2">the fullness of being human is something</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.010" end="00:41:44.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not just painted for young white</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.470" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">men and it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.660" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2">I think an ancient African is so</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.460" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">interesting but it&#39;s it&#39;s also one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:54.200" style="s2">the reasons why there&#39;s a chapter in my</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:56.510" style="s2">book on mothers because st. Monica plays</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.200" end="00:41:58.790" style="s2">such a huge role and it&#39;s just I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.510" end="00:42:01.250" style="s2">want to make sure that the other half of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.790" end="00:42:05.510" style="s2">humanity is ink is included in this but</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.250" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">but I&#39;m really intrigued and we share an</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.510" end="00:42:12.109" style="s2">overlapping concern I think with</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:13.790" style="s2">Toronto Carl Jung and then how it gave</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.109" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">rise to the novels of Robertson Davies</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.790" end="00:42:18.140" style="s2">in fact date Robertson Davies who I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">mentioned earlier was the first master</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.140" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">of Massey College at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:26.270" style="s2">Toronto and so to me when I first</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:29.510" style="s2">started hearing Peterson it actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.270" end="00:42:32.060" style="s2">brought back to mind a series of novels</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.510" end="00:42:33.530" style="s2">that Davies had written in the 70s which</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.060" end="00:42:35.600" style="s2">I just think it&#39;s kind of cool to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.530" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">imagine as a Canadian I think it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.600" end="00:42:40.670" style="s2">that there&#39;s this burbling and bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:43.250" style="s2">of ideas coming out of Toronto that now</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.670" end="00:42:44.510" style="s2">the world is paying attention to - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.250" end="00:42:48.290" style="s2">and like I said before i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.510" end="00:42:51.100" style="s2">recommend jon bovi key as yes yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.290" end="00:42:53.510" style="s2">no that&#39;s I&#39;m glad to learn that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.100" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">just as you mentioned Foucault and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.510" end="00:42:58.190" style="s2">Derrida what do you think the Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:59.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand about them oh that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:01.970" style="s2">that would be a much longer conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.450" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">but I just think that I think he paints</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.970" end="00:43:07.609" style="s2">them as to paint someone for example as</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">Jacques Derrida as just this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.609" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">Nietzsche and nihilist is not to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">read his corpus so I I have another book</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:20.570" style="s2">called who&#39;s afraid of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:23.480" style="s2">which is Derrida Foucault and Liat are</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.570" end="00:43:25.400" style="s2">and interestingly it was written before</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.480" end="00:43:27.980" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson phenomena I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.400" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a 2006 book but I was I have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.980" end="00:43:33.740" style="s2">thinking about a bit as Peterson&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:36.080" style="s2">on these figures has gotten off the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.740" end="00:43:41.710" style="s2">ground only because I think you see a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.080" end="00:43:44.869" style="s2">Derrida actually a desire for an</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.710" end="00:43:47.270" style="s2">openness to transcendence for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.869" end="00:43:48.590" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s a real it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.270" end="00:43:50.590" style="s2">a I don&#39;t want to deny that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.590" end="00:43:54.350" style="s2">ambiguous but there is a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.590" end="00:43:56.869" style="s2">Agustin sorry Derrida by the in the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.350" end="00:43:59.660" style="s2">10 years of his career is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.869" end="00:44:02.270" style="s2">the messianic right is talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.660" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">justice that is to come so there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:08.119" style="s2">just a much more complicated story as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:10.340" style="s2">academic who also translates ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.119" end="00:44:12.440" style="s2">wider audiences I know that every</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.340" end="00:44:14.660" style="s2">scholar who does that is in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.440" end="00:44:17.810" style="s2">dying the death of a thousand missing</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.660" end="00:44:19.369" style="s2">footnotes so but it would be some day it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.810" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">would be it would be fun to have that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.369" end="00:44:21.530" style="s2">conversation because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.020" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.530" end="00:44:27.110" style="s2">to be done on that front yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.020" end="00:44:29.510" style="s2">I I&#39;m not a I&#39;m not so aware of Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.110" end="00:44:32.830" style="s2">but I know that leotard for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.510" end="00:44:35.750" style="s2">talked about the transcendent and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.830" end="00:44:37.580" style="s2">transcendent the postmodernist idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.750" end="00:44:39.620" style="s2">falls apart or the whole post modernist</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.580" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">project falls apart without fear of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.620" end="00:44:45.140" style="s2">transcendent risk which is which to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:46.850" style="s2">means there&#39;s an awareness of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.140" end="00:44:50.120" style="s2">of Hall of Mirrors we can get lost in if</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.850" end="00:44:54.380" style="s2">we don&#39;t have that sort of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.120" end="00:44:55.850" style="s2">fixed point so that&#39;s yeah it would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.380" end="00:45:00.470" style="s2">an interesting thing maybe truth burn -</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.850" end="00:45:02.390" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah one one interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.470" end="00:45:04.790" style="s2">footnote - is that one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:06.710" style="s2">posthumous works of leotard that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.790" end="00:45:10.430" style="s2">published after his death was a book on</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.710" end="00:45:12.790" style="s2">st. Augusta yeah so so st. Augustine has</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.430" end="00:45:17.540" style="s2">been this enduring fascinate Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.790" end="00:45:19.880" style="s2">Foucault leotard jean-luc Mary are all</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.540" end="00:45:23.960" style="s2">these contemporary and 20 century French</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.880" end="00:45:25.790" style="s2">figures Camus they all engaged with st.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.960" end="00:45:27.350" style="s2">Augustine at various points in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.790" end="00:45:29.780" style="s2">century and that&#39;s kind of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.350" end="00:45:31.910" style="s2">subtexts of my book on the road the st.</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.780" end="00:45:35.870" style="s2">Agustin is that you could see something</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:39.950" style="s2">someone like Camus Ibaka who also hunger</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.870" end="00:45:43.070" style="s2">for meaning-making and and also</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.950" end="00:45:47.300" style="s2">appreciated just what it meant to not</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.070" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">accept Christianity and yet he did and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.300" end="00:45:53.000" style="s2">and I actually think he&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:54.530" style="s2">Augustinian atheist he sort of he&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.000" end="00:45:56.570" style="s2">so deep he did his doctoral dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.530" end="00:45:58.520" style="s2">on Agustin and neoplatonist it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.570" end="00:46:01.840" style="s2">fascinating so that&#39;s one of the threads</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.520" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">I chase in the book awesome great and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.840" end="00:46:07.150" style="s2">just coming back to the idea of practice</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">because that that definitely seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.150" end="00:46:11.500" style="s2">something that&#39;s really alive right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:14.690" style="s2">what are the practices that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.500" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">engage in rediscover live out in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.690" end="00:46:17.210" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.260" end="00:46:21.770" style="s2">what&#39;s your what&#39;s your attitude to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.210" end="00:46:24.740" style="s2">practice yeah so I think we are what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.770" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">love and we love what we practice so so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.740" end="00:46:34.840" style="s2">in that sense for me practices are habit</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:34.840" style="s2">forming heart shaping</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.000" end="00:46:39.350" style="s2">rhythms rituals and routines that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:41.270" style="s2">actually gift me with an identity so</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.350" end="00:46:43.700" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really really important to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.270" end="00:46:45.380" style="s2">then ask what am i practicing and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.700" end="00:46:47.450" style="s2">am I and when I&#39;m asking that what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.380" end="00:46:52.700" style="s2">should really be asking myself is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.450" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">story is embedded and and enacted by</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.700" end="00:46:58.030" style="s2">these rhythms and rituals what ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.950" end="00:47:00.980" style="s2">story about Who I am what we call to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.030" end="00:47:02.900" style="s2">so I use the word it&#39;s a churchy word</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.980" end="00:47:06.890" style="s2">but I actually used the word Liturgy</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.900" end="00:47:10.430" style="s2">liturgies to just talk about love</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.890" end="00:47:12.650" style="s2">shaping practices now that means there</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.430" end="00:47:15.890" style="s2">are all kinds of liturgies that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.650" end="00:47:17.570" style="s2">outside of religious contexts right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.890" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">what is a liturgy a liturgy is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.570" end="00:47:24.620" style="s2">performed enacted narrative it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:27.170" style="s2">script that when I give myself over to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.620" end="00:47:29.750" style="s2">it in a way that story is getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.170" end="00:47:32.390" style="s2">inscribed in my bones it&#39;s getting under</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.750" end="00:47:34.520" style="s2">my skin it&#39;s it&#39;s getting buried in my</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.390" end="00:47:38.270" style="s2">gut and then I start living out that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.520" end="00:47:40.910" style="s2">story so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think my way to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:45.590" style="s2">new loves I practice my way to new loves</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.910" end="00:47:48.140" style="s2">now I do think that our late modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.590" end="00:47:49.790" style="s2">culture offers all kinds of deformative</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.140" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">liturgies in that regard like we talked</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.790" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">about marketing earlier so I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">consumer culture is its own liturgy but</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:48:00.110" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly one that defaces me and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">deforms me and and tells me a story</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.110" end="00:48:07.310" style="s2">about myself that it makes me less than</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:10.340" style="s2">human and for me again just I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.310" end="00:48:13.400" style="s2">trying to prove anything or but I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.340" end="00:48:16.190" style="s2">say the way I understand Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.400" end="00:48:19.970" style="s2">not just a belief system it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.190" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">worldview it is this enacted script of</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.970" end="00:48:25.610" style="s2">grace and so at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:29.990" style="s2">Christianity for me is the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.610" end="00:48:31.850" style="s2">the liturgy in which the story of God in</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.990" end="00:48:35.600" style="s2">Christ reconciling all things to himself</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.850" end="00:48:37.640" style="s2">is enacted and it&#39;s important that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.600" end="00:48:39.590" style="s2">that like for example you know we never</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.640" end="00:48:42.710" style="s2">go to church without engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.590" end="00:48:44.390" style="s2">confession but we also never engage in</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.710" end="00:48:46.100" style="s2">confession without hearing the good news</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.390" end="00:48:48.150" style="s2">of mercy and pardon and forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.100" end="00:48:52.289" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty good practice</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.150" end="00:48:56.279" style="s2">for how to relate to other people but</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.289" end="00:48:58.650" style="s2">it&#39;s so that but it&#39;s deeply communal as</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.279" end="00:49:00.180" style="s2">well so it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s what in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.650" end="00:49:03.210" style="s2">Christian tradition we call these are</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.180" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">sacraments which means that they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.210" end="00:49:09.990" style="s2">means of grace that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:12.869" style="s2">fuelling of capacity and possibility in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.990" end="00:49:14.700" style="s2">me just by giving myself over to them</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.869" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">and I know that sounds kind of crazy but</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.700" end="00:49:18.569" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the mystery of it all I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.569" end="00:49:23.220" style="s2">communal do you know I think this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:27.299" style="s2">something I can you know no podcast will</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.220" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">ever substitute for the Eucharist no</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.299" end="00:49:32.490" style="s2">matter how smart it might make me</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:34.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of enactment of a story</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.490" end="00:49:36.869" style="s2">that physically I I really think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.829" end="00:49:38.970" style="s2">important Christianity is a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.869" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">Incarnation or religious right like it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.970" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">believes not only does it believe that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:46.799" style="s2">God became human it believes that humans</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:48.420" style="s2">are ensouled bodies and that embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.799" end="00:49:50.940" style="s2">is really really crucial so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.420" end="00:49:53.190" style="s2">practices are way for bodies to get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.940" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">story and then the last thing I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.190" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">say too is that I I guess I&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">more and more convinced that practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:04.710" style="s2">of friendship are so crucial in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.710" style="s2">cultural moment in which we find</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.710" end="00:50:10.529" style="s2">ourselves I think I I think we almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.710" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to be friends anymore we</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.529" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">know how to be companions we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.420" style="s2">be a gang we know how to hang out but</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.710" end="00:50:18.359" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you really know how to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.420" end="00:50:22.289" style="s2">friends and and my sincere hope is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.359" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">that churches are not big performance</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.289" end="00:50:25.980" style="s2">holes at the end of the day they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:27.720" style="s2">congregations where people learn how to</p>
