<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">john has this world uh called reinventio</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.040" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">um which is this idea of of reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:21.199" style="s2">and discovering</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">um you know perennial things</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.199" end="00:00:26.320" style="s2">uh um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:27.760" style="s2">and then i wrote this article recent or</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.320" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">a while ago called</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.760" end="00:00:32.800" style="s2">we need a renaissance not not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">revolution so i wonder if you guys could</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.800" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">perhaps riff on on this idea of well</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:40.480" style="s2">what do you think of my idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:41.200" style="s2">renaissance is more appropriate to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.480" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">time than</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.200" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">than revolution and that&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:48.399" style="s2">uh for the future and then maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">we can talk a bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.399" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">um the religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">or john&#39;s idea and and maybe your idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">of concrete utopia and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">maybe we can go deeper into the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">education and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">that sounds good i mean the term is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.520" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">actually from kerry his book on</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">augustine um</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">and he says he wants to he wanted to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">it comes out in english and he&#39;s unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">with the english translations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">augustine&#39;s invention of the inner self</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">and he said the word he wanted was latin</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">but the publishers wouldn&#39;t let him use</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">the word is inventio which means both it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">means both to invent and to discover</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">yeah and uh i i i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">interested in that as a replacement term</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">for the term that i was always unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">the idea of sort of salvaging from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">can i connect one more thing before you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">continue the reason i thought this</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">concept was important is because i asked</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">myself the question</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">what do we need to reinvent the oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">hard to say that yeah i like that i like</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">oh and and it occurs to me everything we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">need to reinvent practically</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">everything i mean in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:00.079" style="s2">institutions but at the same time we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to give you know we want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.079" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">salvage</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">to use your word again yeah what matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">or what what you know the the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">and zach talks about neoperennialism</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">so i i mean i like i i like in fact what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with that idea andrew how</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">taking it up as let&#39;s go through various</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">some central</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">normative constructs and uh see if</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">you know if the inventio is is uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">required and then what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">i&#39;m very interested in that project</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing it you and chris and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">i&#39;d like to continue that um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">i&#39;m also interested in um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">the thing you propose i i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">contrasting the actual revolution with</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">the french revolution and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">things i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">talking about um and then what we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">is something more like the axial</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">than the french revolution and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">sounds like it could at least be put</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">into constructive dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">with your idea of renaissance versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">revolution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">and the other sorry to keep jumping in</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">here but the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">the other uh thing that i thought that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">reinvent eo i have a really hard time</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">saying that reinventio</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">um is because it&#39;s it&#39;s such a concern</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">of zacks</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">is how we think about you know social</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">justice and that kind of thing i thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">interesting i&#39;d like to talk about way</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">who can bring care and concern to it uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">because um it seems to me right now that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">the discourse around social justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">is becoming uh very oversimplified</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s either being what&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">happening uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">and the fact that some people even take</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">this as an insult is kind of telling</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">i think what&#39;s happening right now with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">the social justice movement is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">we&#39;re actually seeing it&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">much more than it&#39;s just a political</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">movement uh because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">serving a lot of functions that religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">serves and i&#39;d like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">um what like with zach i guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">about what that might be like what does</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">it mean in terms of the broader idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been already</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">talking about about well the reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">of education and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">the deeper connections between education</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">and enculturation</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">and between education and virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked to also</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">you know the connections between</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">education and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">the mythopoetic discourse both between</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">people and within people</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">i think the pursuit of justice without</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">the pursuit of software son</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">is a brave mistake and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">it seems to me that one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">that was supposed to mediate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">moderate between those two</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">is education and so there&#39;s a lot i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">like to talk can you remind me what</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">sauferson is what that term means</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">jefferson is the untranslatable one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">the four</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">cardinal greek virtues and and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">wisdom you can make a good case that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">sauferson is actually more of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">virtue than a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s often paired with</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">justice uh plato</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">famously does it in the republic where</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">he talks about justice in the city</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s reflected in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">state within the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">a kind of inner justice and software</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a culture of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">psyche so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">it is reliably self-organizing to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">what is good and what is true and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">totally and that&#39;s why the the paidia or</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">the basic educational structure</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">uh total fragmentation of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">and removal from the grounding of of</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">kind of uprising and the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">social justice warriors</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">you know most of this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">this context of socialization</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">and especially the informational</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">like if we could get into rawlsy</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">injustice and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">platinus&#39;s notions of justice and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">you can look at justice</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">even in buddhism and other discourses</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">that don&#39;t use that term but there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">ways of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">those are very different from the in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:48.639" style="s2">kind of personality complexes uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">and character structures that are being</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">formed in these</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">socialization environments of uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">informational</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">like digital informational ecologies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">yeah well i was gonna say like it like</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">part of what i mean by it being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">religious phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">is one of the things religions do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">they tend to generate</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">um normative claims they generate they</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">tend to generate new virtues often</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">right like you know christianity makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">love and faith into virtues and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">weren&#39;t before</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">we now take it for granted you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">thomas aquinas has to write a large</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">piece on it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">trying to explain why love is a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">and so i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">like we&#39;re very we&#39;re i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">close and it&#39;s in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">concerning to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">to to outrage becoming a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">and this ties into what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">zach because</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">we know i mean sorry i don&#39;t mean to i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">not generally not conspiratorial at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">but we know the algorithms on social</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">media polarize people</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">and drive them to outrage and to extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">statements and to flip</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">reasoning because that promotes</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">right connection and advertising and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">viewing et cetera et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">and people i think is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">alluding to with social media people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">you know they&#39;re being educated in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">very profound way</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">way of being in which outrage seems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">a virtuous thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m not clear that outrage is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">should ever be considered a candidate</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">this is completely independent about</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">what the issue the outrage is directed</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">at yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">i think there&#39;s relevant issues</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">important issues i&#39;m not denying that at</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not what i&#39;m talking about i want</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">to make that really clear i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">the promotion within sort of a religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">of outrage as a virtue like the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">will often say to me in conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">and they&#39;ll say it sort of critically</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t you outraged about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">and i&#39;ll say well i have arguments</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">against it and i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re they&#39;re upset with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">outraged and that&#39;s that&#39;s the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">i&#39;m putting my finger on right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">i i just have a thought here just just</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">give another another perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">because i was listening to the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">rabbi and he was talking and saying all</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">these people are they&#39;re out in the</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">um why wouldn&#39;t they do that if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have a proper</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">uh basic religious education that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">the rabbi was saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">you know why wouldn&#39;t they do that if</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">of of uh any refined idea of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">of what is you know what is virtue</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">so that&#39;s just i agree with what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">20 or 15 years so there&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">conversation to have there so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a distraction from actual social</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">organizers of the occupy movement wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">a book at the end of protest i&#39;d talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">about a lot because it&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">and he was like listen at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">point the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">occupied became it started to function</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">for its own representation in the social</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">field right which is to say like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">weren&#39;t doing it to do it you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">it to represent it into the social media</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">as a as a signal you know and uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the dynamic here</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">is that there&#39;s yeah the simulations</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">layered on top of the actual reality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">often makes the actual reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">less less real less important so people</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">are like</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">these mob develop and they look for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">you know and the scapegoat is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">random and uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">you know and they prop the scapegoat up</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">you know sacrifice him and then make him</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">into a god of some</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">some kind yeah and so i mean the general</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">takeaway is like</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">you know the first move has to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:43.880" style="s2">something about that like the first move</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">actually has to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.880" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">reclaiming the basic foundations that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">allow us to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">right um which is to say kind of rolling</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">because the social justice thing social</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">looking at young people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">uh being used strategically</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">and yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s a disconcerting</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">and uh i agree there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">religiosity and religious kind of fervor</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">which i attribute to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">exquisite</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">uh advertising and algorithmical</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">capacity of the social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">uh because they&#39;ve they&#39;re they know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">right as advertisers do they know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">set of words right the simple abstract</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">mappings a couple abstract contents next</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">to one another</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">with a certain word sound power that</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">is on a poster and it just who started</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">that good question</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">like where do these things begin and how</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">do they propagate through the social</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">media field</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">and become attachable to the self</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">brought up into the self&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">self-esteem regulation</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">self-understanding uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">and now you&#39;re running a kind of modus</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">operandi for your life where</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">your representation of yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">social media is the actual basis of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">and your immediate and your immediate</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">is not the basis where you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">your self-esteem um</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">and uh that&#39;s the total capture of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">cell system</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">by the kind of attention harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">information capitalism or surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the most egregious because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">not just that over stimulation</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">and capture of like through hyperstimuli</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">the limbic system</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s also capture of the self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">regulation mechanism and identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">formation mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">uh through that kind of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">and and like uh you know pseudo diet</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">pseudo uh that&#39;s the right word pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">attachment or</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">pseudo recognition system that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">social media kind of puts up as a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">um so anyway it kind of kept going there</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">i think that i wanted to get that he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">stuff out it was good</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">the part you ended on it circles back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">the concern i have</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">right that when you when you sever the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">virtues from each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">you tend to get what one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">you get is you get the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">of having a self-representation with</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">actually being in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">and but</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">we have to remember that you know people</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">getting trained in these</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">patterns of behavior and and that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">ultimately manipulated outside of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">they can be directed other ways right</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">this machine the fact that it might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">directed towards causes that you and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">believe in right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that this machine can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">equally directed towards causes</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">that we we think are like wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s my concern</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">and i have no faith in corporate</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">capitalism to keep my best interests at</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">so that that&#39;s what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">i&#39;m concerned about uh the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">the the powers that be are just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">you know just there&#39;s the uncritical</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">sort of this is just a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">that&#39;s happening and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know i i i&#39;m very concerned</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">about what we&#39;re what we&#39;re teaching</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">uh about how to try and bring about</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">change uh because</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">i always worry about especially when i</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">the corporate capitalists people just</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">jumping on board this and loving it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">saying it&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">like that that also makes me like why</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">are you doing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re not better you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">doing this for any moral argument you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">you&#39;re benefiting from this in some way</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">and so again i don&#39;t i generally have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">heuristic of not</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">going anywhere towards conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">theories but i think the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">this has layers of causation below it</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">that that the demonstrators are not</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">and that those layers can be put to uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">other ends that could turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">what i would regard as seriously immoral</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s a very deep concern i</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">have it&#39;s a bit what daniel</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:35.039" style="s2">schmacktenberg always talks about is</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">truth is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.039" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">something true becomes weaponized right</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">it&#39;s something something is something</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">that is maybe a beautiful expression</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">becomes a corporate logo or</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">you know it&#39;s that and it&#39;s my overall</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">concern right</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">that the thing that one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">powerful biases that keeps us from being</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">rational</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">is to find the products of our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">super salient</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">and not be concerned with attend to or</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">value the processes</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">by which we try to achieve our goals i</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:13.360" style="s2">mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s both that&#39;s an argument</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.360" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">that comes out of sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">philosophical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">and you know overwhelming i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">empirical recent empirical work and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">experimental work and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">that so i have a concern that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">that as i said we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">paying attention to how are we like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">what is going on such that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">these things that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">like it&#39;s a very socratic concern</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s a difficult thing to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">because i do think</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s clear there&#39;s police brutality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that police have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">demilitarized</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">i mean and zach and i&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">about this before and i&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">about it for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">he&#39;s of course talked about it more</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">eloquently our culture as a whole should</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">shifting its resources into education in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">we haven&#39;t been doing i i think these</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">are important in things that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">pursued</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">and the problem i have is i try to talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">to people about</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s an important part of problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">solving is to make sure you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">formulated the problem well</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure the problem has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">formulated well and i&#39;m even afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">bring that criticism up</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">i could you know i yeah look i i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">your goals are right but the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">formulating trying to achieve those</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">is exactly thwarting you from achieving</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">them and so that&#39;s the concern</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">but these people actually become beyond</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">criticism because</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">because they are they they are in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">state of of religious</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">uh fanaticism you know so you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">go into a a in-depth analysis because</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an article of faith isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">when people talk about these things well</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know about all</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">the people that are involved i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">this is well documented as a part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">what protest culture has become</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to talk too political here</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">but i i remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">something about in russia that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">putin was he was funding</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">both sides besides it was against him</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">and the side that was for him and he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">funding them both because he knew that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">by getting people all worked up they</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">would just become distracted and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">and uh that way he could keep keep power</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">you know and uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">large foreign governments wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">structure that&#39;s keeping</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">existing test movements and civil</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">disrupts going the united states is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">like we know china for example does</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">unconventional warfare</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">so so it&#39;s just this question of looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">past the surface</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">running the hermeneutics of suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">which is part of the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">thing is running a hermeneutic suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">run the hermeneutics of suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">on your own shit and start looking more</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">into the the many layers of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">actually unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">as opposed to what might be unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">and again i i&#39;m arguing not that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">injustice doesn&#39;t exist i&#39;m arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">the media spectacle is actually running</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">a screen between</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">us and the actual injustices and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">actual ways to get in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">start to do things about them and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">begins with having civil</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">conversations and engaging in collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">inquiry about our shared reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">which means finding the space of reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">and you know moving back from that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">retreat into</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">pure strategic action and the worst</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">place we&#39;re seeing the strategic action</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">is in the intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">right and this i&#39;ve spoken about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">before but like uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">the difference between raising children</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">and designing children</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">and what advertising does is design</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">children facebook is designing children</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not raising them yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">raising a child is a non-strategic</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">of communicative action mutual</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">understanding uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">designing a child is a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">intervention</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">you require words in the sense of even</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">trying to establish mutual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">here is actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">for a certain threshold of generational</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">transmission there was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">much higher incidence of purely</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">strategic interaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">as the main event during</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">childhood development and socialization</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s terrible you know that that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">kind of disables the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">for uh non-strategic interaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">and would actually make one deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">suspicious of anyone who wasn&#39;t acting</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">strategically because you&#39;d think it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">just some higher level strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">and so that&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">now i think i&#39;ve lost you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">cutting out a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">zach um are you experiencing zach</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">cutting out a bit or is that just me uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">john oh uh he&#39;s also cutting up for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">you&#39;re cutting out just a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">that&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">maybe you could just repeat the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">thing you&#39;ve said because i it was very</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">uh i was i was basically saying that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">believe in this is a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">but give me some years and we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">i believe that there&#39;s been a situation</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">such that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">at a certain point in time maybe 2016</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">the predominant communicational context</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">in which socialization was occurring in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">the united states became</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">more strategic than not which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">that the main experience i&#39;m having of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">other people is that they&#39;re relating to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">me strategically</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">including my own family teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">especially the screen that i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">at all day</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">and it becomes so normal that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">realize that there&#39;s a space of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">non-strategic</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">communication right we&#39;re the unforced</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">force of the better argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">where mutual agreement and mutual</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">understanding are primary and content is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">sometimes secondary and a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">other factors which make for</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">healthy socialization environment where</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">you can regulate self-esteem you know in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s mediated through the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">embodied experiences of people around</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">you and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">and so yeah the idea that when</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">social media started to tip towards one</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">of the main effects</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">of socialization and identity formation</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">you also got it tipping towards the main</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">environment of identity formation being</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">strategic an environment of design as</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">opposed to an environment which one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">being raised</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">so that means beyond a certain threshold</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">generational threshold there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">massive kind of like opening in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">character structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">the force for something like infection</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">or manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">by social complex social media fields</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s a strange hypothesis but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">one of the only ways that i can explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">and the more you look at the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">social media and realize what an</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">engineered</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">environment it is like just how</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">uh just how complex the psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">micro targeting becomes and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">how easily it captures you just how</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">dedicated they were to figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">to capture</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">you yeah not like people like you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">uh you realize it&#39;s it&#39;s a deeply uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">you know deeply kind of it&#39;s is not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">right word it&#39;s a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">context of socialization for humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">it&#39;s um usually not the case like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">usually the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">most of the modality you&#39;re having in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">communication is non-strategic</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">right it&#39;s trust-based and relational</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">and embodied with family members or</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">members of your community now in rare</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">situations like warfare</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">or serious abuse or maybe you&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">really bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">orphanage i mean there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">scenarios where it would be different</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">you feel like everyone&#39;s strategically</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">relating to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">and manipulating you uh but to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">you know so i&#39;m just it&#39;s it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">the things that takes me back</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">and makes me worry when i see the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">kind of degradation of discourse and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">of language and the kind of like use of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">advertising grade communicative tricks</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">by young people in social media fields</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">to get a point to get across like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">ideas that they haven&#39;t actually thought</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:51.360" style="s2">allegiance to a meta-narrative to</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.360" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">they&#39;re running very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.399" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">like media tropes which they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">second nature to them because of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:01.679" style="s2">context of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">socialization where you&#39;re not reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.679" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">you&#39;re advertising</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">constantly like you know you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">your strategizing so what&#39;s the way out</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">of the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">like uh you know i brought up this idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">of a renaissance and you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">um we have to step back on some level</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">right we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">we have to rediscover um our</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">like repurpose you know all this garbage</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">we create and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">um there&#39;s some things that i think i</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">part a piece i would first of all add to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">what zach was saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">the reason why i was silent is because i</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">was in complete agreement with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">very eloquently expressed i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">there&#39;s added dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">i mean so slogans work on the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">illusion i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">like i think it&#39;s put on amphetamines by</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">so the knowledge illusion is people</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">regularly confuse access to knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">with possession of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">they deeply confuse it they think they</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">when they don&#39;t and you can and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">actually kind of a shocking thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">like you ask people you know how a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">bicycle works and they&#39;re oh yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">course i do very confidently</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">and then you say okay we&#39;ll draw a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">picture of a bicycle and show kids that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">will explain to me how it works</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">and they start doing it and they realize</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">they have no idea how a bicycle works</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">or a toilet and what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">is when you translate this over into</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">when you ask people to state their</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">values on an issue they polarize</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">but when you ask them to explain the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">mechanisms of the issue that is at work</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">they actually move towards agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">each other and understanding each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">so right if i ask you know what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">republican take on this at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">democratic way</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">people will go on this but if you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">if you actually ask people</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">but what are the causes of poverty i</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">not what do you think we should do about</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">it but what are the causes of it what</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">are the processes</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">and then what happens is people realize</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">that their ignorance is much more shared</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">than that and they move towards right</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">actually coming to have an empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">understanding of other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">but the problem with social media is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">it takes the knowledge illusion and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">explodes it because people</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">are being educated right to believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">that their access to the internet is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">same thing as having knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">and and that seems so innocent because</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking oh but it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">just like an electronic library</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">but no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">overwhelmingly not it really puts</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">because in a library you have to go and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">search</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">you have to gather things together you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">have to put a lot of thought in you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">to talk to other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">the internet it&#39;s got everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">organized for you it&#39;s got algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re invaded by algorithms right right</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">you see what i&#39;m saying it magnifies the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">illusion and and this is again what and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">if you take that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">and you put that with what zach saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">people are basically i would call it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">kind of modal confusion that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">uh manipulating each other rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">uh the deep recognition that we become</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">persons through each other a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">gaping notion</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">that has been lost uh when you put those</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">two together when people think they know</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">uh when they don&#39;t and they think they</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">need people when they do uh i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">then you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">you&#39;re into a very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">situation because people will then</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">make they will have it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">like the line from yates right</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">uh about you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">passionate intensity uh for for things</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">um are actually very very questionable</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">and so i guess what i&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">i think that well</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">i propose that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">get back to a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">about discourse</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">that integrates self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">the creation of personhood and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">of uh of deep understanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">back together and that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">to do with the whole dialectic deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">logos project</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why i think this project is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">central because teaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">people that speech</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">can be a place in which human</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">being personhood that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">and also selfhood right i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">the socratic idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">that that you&#39;re knowing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">if you if you think if you&#39;re prejudiced</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">to believe because i think it&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">of prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been culturated that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">is basically an act that&#39;s achieved</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:04.599" style="s2">through introspection</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">or as as access through</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.599" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">self-representation</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">whereas the socratic thing is no no</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">self-knowledge is revealed only in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">with others because that it&#39;s only there</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">where it becomes clear what you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">committed to and what you actually know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.599" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to argue for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">what i that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.599" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">i this project i&#39;ve been pursuing so</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">this is why i think i want to put it</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">into dialogue with what zach&#39;s proposing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">about education</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">i think of the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">reverse engineer reinventio via logos</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">is central to everything we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">about here because we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">taken all of these functions and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">pulled them apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve made ourselves pray to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">and to knowledge illusion and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">commodore confusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">and to confusing self-representation</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">with self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">and self-transformation and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">that with reintegrating speech</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">communitas transformation</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">aspiration i that&#39;s why i i</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">i think this is central and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">is a project very different</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">from the projects that are usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">labeled political in our current</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">yeah i mean i&#39;m good i&#39;m sorry how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">how can we even be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">political i have a hard time being</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">political myself and zac i guess this</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">you said you were radicalized because of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">circumstances and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">so you totally but i went i went not</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">into it because because</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">but i you know i almost feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">i&#39;m i almost feel like an irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">person because</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:53.440" style="s2">i i i don&#39;t know where to put my foot in</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">in the political world</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.440" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">um i haven&#39;t i speak about</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">i speak about metapolitics and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">john&#39;s describing</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">uh with the die logos project is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">absolutely not a political movement</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">it is political and it may be innocent</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not superficial politics</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s deep politics</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s changing what could be even</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">possible in the realm of politics</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">okay that&#39;s great politics it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">politics quote unquote is the space</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">where we hash out things according to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">certain rules</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">the metapolitical is where we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">enabling ourselves to change the nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">of those rules that we call political</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">so like right now political action is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">entirely strategic action</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">and you know sociopaths rise through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">ranks</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">as do you get in business and so the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">question would be like if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">politics then we need to change the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">nature of politics but you can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">using politics as usual have to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">metapolitical which is why every time</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">turnover there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">at the level of personhood education</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">logos that&#39;s why i think we&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">revolutionary time we&#39;re in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">renaissance of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">we need to rediscover our humanity on</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">some level</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been so damaged by the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">you know the state of things well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">why i&#39;ve been proposing the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">and i if you guys know my work i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to i&#39;m not not being</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">anachronistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">so i&#39;m taking it as i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">get back to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">but i&#39;m proposing that we that we should</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">be thinking about something like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">rather than the french revolution as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">model we should be considering</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">uh because what happens in the axial</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">uh through the permeation</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">of all of the new psycho technologies is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:50.079" style="s2">that the cultural cognitive grammar has</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">changed so new ways of human being</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.079" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">and new ways of human religion and new</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">ways of human wisdom and new</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">ways of human spirituality become</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">possible for us</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">and um that&#39;s where i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">go right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">because i think the issues we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">are are i think they&#39;re even more</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">profound than</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">what was going on i know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">trying to say andrew about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">renaissance but i think the issues we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">facing</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">are it&#39;s a much more significant</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">transition we might be going through</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">even more than the renaissance a greater</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">a greater transition well i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:23.040" style="s2">renaissance is wrestling with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">things it&#39;s wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">you know it&#39;s wrestling with uh the you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">know the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">the the the corruption the decline of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">the catholic church</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s wrestling with the rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">aristotelian science</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s wrestling with the rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">magic which by the way eventually gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">taken up</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">into advertising uh so that&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">uh history of its own so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">of things going on here</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">uh but i think i guess i&#39;m more thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:54.800" style="s2">of the essence of the word renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">like rebirth rather than rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.800" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">uh moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s what i&#39;m because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not a historian</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">and but i think what</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">i guess what i want to what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">emphasize the difference is although</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">there was a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">sort of maybe falling apart uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">on the cusp of the renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">i think we&#39;re under much more threat</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">of a much more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">kind of disaster and collapse</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">and so uh that&#39;s why i think of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">you know the way people sort of come out</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">of the bronze age collapse</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:37.680" style="s2">uh in the axial revolution it might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">more helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.680" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to know zach</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">is right this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re in is very historically</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">unprecedented and so we have to take</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">these historical models</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">very carefully we shouldn&#39;t be really</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">attached to them really i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve been trying to think of a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s the the renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">then that circuitous route through the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">enlightenment and the 30 years war in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">that period which was the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">overthrow of the ancient regime and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">birth of capitalism nation state all</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">and then there were hegemonic turnovers</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">within the history of capitalism right</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">from the dutch uh well first from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">jawanese or the italians to the dutch</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">than the british than the united states</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">so there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">so what is it like that lead up to world</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">war one</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">when it went from the british to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">united states and this capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">hegemony that&#39;s bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">is it as big as the turnover of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">ancient regime into</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">the you know end of the feudal period</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">beginning the capitalist period</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">that one seems pretty resonant but now</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re saying well maybe it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:36.880" style="s2">collapse of the bronze age</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">right at the beginning of the axial</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">revolution which is an even</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">deeper thing and then you could even ask</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">the question well is it actually as</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">significant as</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">uh when humans first began to use</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">language right now i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">that too</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">is it that deep or is it a significance</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">as the emergence of you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">from single cellular just saying like</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">kind of evolutionary transition are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">actually in</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">and the digital is pretty weird and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">planetary right and high technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">probably is even higher than we know</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">because of all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">you know dark money and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">multiple ongoing manhattan projects have</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">been going on for the past 20 years so</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:27.400" style="s2">the chance that we&#39;re actually at a much</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">more profound</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.400" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">evolutionary mode</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">as opposed to like historical mode</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">sometimes is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">resonates with me</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">and then i go kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">transhumanist and begin to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">the radical radical possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">personhood that may end up having to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">actualized</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">during this during this time because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">want to go into that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you we&#39;re talking a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">bit you were talking about that with</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">with jim rutt you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">um you know well i mean it&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">expression you use transhuman um</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">religion i say religious transhumanism</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">just because transhumanism</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">you know much of the discussions like</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.839" style="s2">kurzweil and and others</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.839" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">eschatological</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">religious flavor to what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">about anyway the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">artificial intelligence overlords or</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">whatever they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">and then you know moving our</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">our situation is</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">so big that we couldn&#39;t know like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">can&#39;t act we actually can and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">whole thing to say about that how to act</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">even though</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t have total clarity um</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">but in a sense i think there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">recognition we have to have that yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know and we actually can&#39;t we</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">okay so where how do we act from that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">place of of unknowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">i mean i think it has to do with care i</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">like it has to do with moving back down</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">actual certainty exists you know like my</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">love for my wife i&#39;m pretty certain of</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">like you know whether or not we&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">into uh you know i&#39;m not certain of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">in any way</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like but the certainty for the love</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">for my wife</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">right um in concrete situations</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">i can be certain about what the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">thing to do is in abstract conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to be certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">and there are definitely moral dilemmas</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">where it&#39;s not clear what the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s plenty of cases where you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">you know where you where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a base</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">certainty at the level of the life world</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s given</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">um so long as we&#39;re in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">reason and not strategically acting then</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">it&#39;s muddy um so in a sense when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">wandering in the wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">ontologically</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">make sense for orienting</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">uh you can you can move you can come to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">the local</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">to the you can return to the local which</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">or the relative because the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">is actually hidden uh in in these local</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">uh member i&#39;ve used that phrase anthro</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">ontological common sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">right that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">capacity to orient together around</p>

<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">so those things i think we&#39;re still in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">that realm of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">um you know disingenuous scientific</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">arguments that try to diffuse that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">certainty with like arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">neurological determinism</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">uh and nihilistic materialism</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">trying to undercut what we know from</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">anthropological excuse me anthro</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">ontological common sense trying to</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">but those are those are not good</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">arguments there&#39;s because science relies</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">on the ability to actually be in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">so the snake eats at sail and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">in which we can care for one another um</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">and from that we can create tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">knowledge and do remarkable inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">um but uh i&#39;m not gonna override that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">in order to signal some allegiance to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">some meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">you know i&#39;m going to ground in that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">then explore meta-narrative from a basis</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">of of care this temple that i can bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">everywhere a friend of mine is writing a</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know about there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">there&#39;s so much you could do with your</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">take on this i think it&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">convergent but i thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">because i think i think we</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">are in a situation like where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">plausible that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">yeah that we&#39;re facing something more</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">like an evolutionary change</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">because of complexity and because</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">of the emergence of ai these two things</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">synergistically operating together</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">they&#39;re going to put a demand</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">on us to change our conception of human</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">design uh what that fundamentally means</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">so my recommendation for this</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think this is in competition</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">for what</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">zach is proposing but i propose</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">that we put a lot more emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">on our capacity of adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">that we get a deeper understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">what that actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">is that&#39;s what a lot of my work around</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">relevance realization has been about</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">what is our capacity for adapting</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">uh and evolving get a deeper so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">i mean this is this is to my mind a kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">of scientific take on the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">idea of self-knowledge which is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">autobiographical knowledge it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">your capacities it&#39;s knowing the you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">how you actually fundamentally operate</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not your autobiography it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">operation manual</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">and one of the interesting things we</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">could we have the potential to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of what does happen um is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">the the advent of ai and the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">networks work in the internet and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">have all these deleterious</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">consequences we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">but they actually also afford us with</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">some powerful ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">our capacity for adapting and evolving</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">and potentially making that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">focus so so this is what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">trying to do with the reinvention of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">notions like faith</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">and trust try to re-understand them in</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">of ways in which we are accessing and</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">because i think trying to come to a</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">that is attempting some kind of closure</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">i think is massively presumptuous</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.200" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">not only are we ignorant the rate at</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">which we are ignorant about</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">all of this is accelerated and i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:23.359" style="s2">the i don&#39;t know dude if this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">convergent with what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.359" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">zach it feels like it is because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">feels like we you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">we get a good understanding one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">places where we get our best</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">understanding of how we</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">zero in on what&#39;s relevant how we adapt</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">and how we undergo</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:43.359" style="s2">that constant evolution of our ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">to cognitively fit to the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">it is in our phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">interaction i get that i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">one of the core moves</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">in foreign cognitive science but</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">i feel like we&#39;re not saying exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">same thing and we need to do something</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">to be closer together uh i i see the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">like i say this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">generally what i what i i guess in broad</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">strokes mean by</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">getting people to try and cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:12.839" style="s2">how can we reliably</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">how can we use this to really enhance</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">capacity to complexify in a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">that gives them an ongoing</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">complexity of the world that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">think we should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">sort of devoting our resources uh in</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">this situation of ultimately not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">what the hell we are in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">uh-huh so can i just try to say say that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">both try to see if i can compress what</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">you two guys are saying in my own dumb</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">language um so so uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">what i hear zach saying is is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">a return to the life</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">world in some kind of a way in the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">basic realities</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">of life and what i hear john saying is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">is that we have to become more like</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:06.559" style="s2">dancers we have to become more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.200" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">to to uncertainty and and um and so so i</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.559" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">feel there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">movement towards perennialism and zach</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">and a movement towards futurism and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">and john and and then maybe those are</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">the two things that have to come</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">together but</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">if i&#39;m radically if i&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">completely wrong please let me know</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">well i liked everything except the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">the that i i i</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">i i i wouldn&#39;t want futurism i would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s uh i don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">and it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just maybe it&#39;s the closest thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">to stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">is perhaps the the ism that would come</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">closest</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.400" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">the empire has come so complex uh you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">try to enhance your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">adapt uh so that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">can as reliably as possible act in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">virtuous manner</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">yeah and i i think the way they would</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">come together as i</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">i think i&#39;m leading with</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">the space where those adaptations need</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">to take place like the materials and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">complexities that get that adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">muscle going</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">are other people more so</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">or at least as much as uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">objective world and complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">problems in the objective world of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:23.760" style="s2">adapting my physical body to it and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">things of that nature and so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.760" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">and it may be implicit in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">saying but i&#39;m saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">the place where that adaptive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s us</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">we are adapting not me adapting and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">adapting</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">we are adapting and so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">you know that yes return in a sense to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">ability to always be learning and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">growing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">and like focusing on that and but in</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">is always involving other people and uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">something like that i think would be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">way to bring them together because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">agreeing it&#39;s not in a sense i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">saying return to some traditional</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">form of life it&#39;s actually the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">return to one another so we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">out how to evolve together</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">um as as opposed to staying stuck as</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">isolated individuals</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">all independently of like kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">strategic evolutionary relationship i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">saying that&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:26.079" style="s2">model and fiction like that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">the the the reality is of deeply</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.079" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">embedded</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.799" end="00:56:30.559" style="s2">relationality and that we are adapting</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">and then if i</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.559" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">if i adapt in a way that makes it so</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">that you can&#39;t adapt well</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">that sucks right so we need to we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">to code</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">i agree with that i think okay so i</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">think that&#39;s what comes together i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">because i think our most significant i</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">i think this is it shouldn&#39;t be in any</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">way questionable</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">our most significant additivity is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">exactly our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">um engage sophisticated distributed</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">cognition that&#39;s our that&#39;s our main</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:03.680" style="s2">way of adapting to the world i mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">our biggest advantage is culture</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.680" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">that we generate culture which is a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:09.520" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">we basically network brains together to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.520" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">make something</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">way more synergistically powerful than</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">they&#39;re individually capable on their</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">so i if that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s again why</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;s so important to try and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">replace the monological</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">model of reason with the dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">model of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">that we reason best in distributed</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">cognition and that&#39;s again where the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">cognitive science is pointing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">pointing</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">out that we reason much better in groups</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">than we ever do individually and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:39.839" style="s2">tried to make that i&#39;ve tried to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">that a phenomenologically salient thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.839" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">that when you get into genuine via logos</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">both people can come to places that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get to on their own</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">and that has an aesthetic to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">something beautiful there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">lovely in the sense of lovable about</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.280" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s tremendously motivating for</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">people and this is what i mean about</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.799" style="s2">trying to steal the culture if we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">get people oriented towards these things</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.799" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">so they experience reliably the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">motivation to want to enter into that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">we we could do something like what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">christians did to the roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">we can build a a alternative culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">underneath</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">this horribly oppressive regime that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">eventually can actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">you know undermine its undermine it</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m really really interested</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">because where where</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">there have been those moves where people</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">slogan i have actually there&#39;s come out</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">right now with here the dawn that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">has done the meaning wave will steal the</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">and i mean that term very broadly that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">in distributed cognition the way it it</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">but like with the same kind of</p>

<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">does for individuals</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">i think that is a way of you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">weaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">people off the addiction to the toxic</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">aspects of social media and you talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">about beauty too which seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">very important part of it right</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">being able to reconnect to beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s we&#39;re coming back to our last</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">is in the transactional relationship</p>

<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">up doing is you you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">if you want to use kind of gerardian</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">terms you kind of flip</p>

<p begin="01:01:23.760" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s much more in their control</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing you remember is</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:56.559" style="s2">you know like there and there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:58.640" style="s2">for it actually as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.559" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">when you think about the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.640" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">hierarchies of needs models you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">that need for self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:09.680" style="s2">and for self-actualization can only be</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">achieved in those kinds of</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s there&#39;s an excess</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.039" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">are there are places where it just</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.960" end="01:03:08.799" style="s2">so clear that this is a species-specific</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:12.240" style="s2">trait</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.799" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">like this this way of interacting</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.240" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">and using language and uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">the memetic um seduction to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.559" style="s2">a different way of life as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:27.680" style="s2">like so you mean like a positive kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">imitation so you you imitate your</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">your you&#39;re if you&#39;re a child you</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:32.160" style="s2">imitate your mother if you&#39;re a student</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.160" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">you imitate the teacher but not copy him</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">you just</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">yeah you get this transmission from him</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">raises the level of your own um</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:45.200" style="s2">perceptions and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a basic psychological construct</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.200" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">gerard got it from</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">the french psychologist tarde who also</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">influenced</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">james mark baldwin who influenced psja</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">you know baldwin&#39;s whole model entire</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">days was based on the imitations the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:00.960" style="s2">basic driver of</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.640" end="01:04:01.839" style="s2">personality and cognitive development</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.960" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">gerard yeah yeah gerard kind of plugged</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:08.640" style="s2">right into that</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">and then noted just that violence is one</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.640" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">of those things that is particularly</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">imitatable</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">and prone to be like um attractive for</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">imitation so</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">so the notion of memetic violence and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">mimetic desire</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:23.680" style="s2">um came out of a psychological lineage</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:25.839" style="s2">of thinking about imitation as a basic</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.680" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.839" end="01:04:28.880" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have to attach invitation</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">to violence</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.880" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">like we imitate across the board across</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">a whole range of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:39.920" style="s2">and uh so yeah but is there is there a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">space beyond imitation or is it just</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.920" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">always that right</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:44.400" style="s2">quote andrew you know where zach says</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">flipping</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.400" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">uh you know gerard&#39;s notion of flipping</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:50.799" style="s2">the direction the moment of desire</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the virtuous officer</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:55.119" style="s2">steferson is basically at the education</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.440" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">of your salience landscaping so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.119" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">tempted to the good</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what it means yeah that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s in contrast to incratia</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">right yeah i like that you&#39;re naturally</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">tempted towards the good and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">so so it&#39;s making desire it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">desire a positive</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:17.359" style="s2">and passion and and uh you know all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.960" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">emotions a positive force rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.359" end="01:05:20.839" style="s2">rather than uh something that has turned</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">against you and that you enacting</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.839" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">unconsciously</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things socrates</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:29.039" style="s2">claimed to know</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">he claimed to know erotica which is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.039" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">means he</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">he had he had he had its officement in</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">the sense he knew what to care about and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">how to care about it well</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">that&#39;s education again ah that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">amazing actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:45.359" style="s2">i mean that seems to be the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:47.119" style="s2">education knowing what to care about and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.359" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">how to care about it well i mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.119" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">would you agree with that zach or i mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">it should be yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what you say you said you said</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:57.119" style="s2">you say your primary concern is</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.160" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">care um and and also your primary</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.119" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">concern is education</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:05.039" style="s2">and it just occurred to me that</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s what education is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.039" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:09.039" style="s2">on the most fundamental level or should</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">be about right it should be</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.039" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">and and it comes down to something that</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:14.960" style="s2">was said earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">you know you have to be trying to solve</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.960" end="01:06:18.559" style="s2">the right problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">or it&#39;s not worth solving and so so much</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.559" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">of education they give you the problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">and you&#39;re just supposed to solve it um</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:27.359" style="s2">the figuring out how to know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">problem is a good problem to even be</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.359" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">working on yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">formulation right then and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">and clarification of desires another way</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:37.520" style="s2">to say that and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.119" style="s2">you know if if education gives you what</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.520" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">you want that&#39;s like advertising right</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.119" end="01:06:42.319" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s uh design it&#39;s not you get</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">a degree or something</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">yeah yeah so it&#39;s about the raising of</p>

<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:52.000" style="s2">to solve a problem they may or may not</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.039" end="01:06:53.680" style="s2">want to solve</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.000" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s getting in them equipped to think</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.680" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">about the kind of life that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">want to pursue right to frame the</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">of their own development and uh yes i</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.480" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">really like this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">you know tipping the balance within</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">oneself so that you&#39;re seduced towards</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">the good</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it is and you&#39;re seduced</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">towards let&#39;s say growth as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">yeah and i can&#39;t tell you growing up</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">continual growth process uh rather than</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">you know you arrive somewhere right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:25.119" style="s2">not like enlightenment it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">continual growth</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">it may be it may be in many areas just</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:32.240" style="s2">continuous growth</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">you know and and there&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.240" end="01:07:34.960" style="s2">difference in terms of like values</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">education you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.960" end="01:07:39.119" style="s2">our place to actually tell you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">good for you it&#39;s to equip you to figure</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.119" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">out what&#39;s good for you</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.119" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">um and this is this is so much of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:47.440" style="s2">some of the justice conversation hinges</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">around you know it hinges around</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.440" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">the way we are able to uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:57.520" style="s2">care for one another uh in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">don&#39;t slide into uh paternalism</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.520" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">right and design um</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">and and that&#39;s so that&#39;s it&#39;s a critical</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">educational issue and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">one of the reasons that we&#39;ve so</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:09.280" style="s2">problematized teacher early authority in</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:11.200" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.280" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">is that we haven&#39;t disentangled it from</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.200" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">paternalism and so much education is</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:15.839" style="s2">paternalistic</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">you know like so we just throw out the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.839" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">role models uh completely right</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">you threat i talk to my students and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">say like do you have any heroes or</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">is there anybody you look up to or that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">you you know you aspire to be like and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:28.319" style="s2">some of them say no</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:30.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.319" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">have they don&#39;t want to have role models</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.480" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to have muddles they</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">just want to be themselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s a dead end that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">we need this mimetic process of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">imitating and the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">who are greater than and and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">wiser than and and more you know than we</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.679" end="01:08:48.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">who we can imitate yeah who we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.159" end="01:08:51.839" style="s2">imitate right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">and uh yeah that&#39;s part of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.839" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">disruption of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">intergenerational transmission is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:09:00.000" style="s2">diffusing of the potency of potential</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">role models just across the board</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.000" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">and uh the retreat to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">self and the screen as the locus</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">of ideal the formation of ideals and</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.480" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">um you know because if you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">to aspire to</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.759" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re getting your messages of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:17.729" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to imitate not from your</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.729" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">then they&#39;ve lost and you&#39;ve won so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.359" style="s2">they&#39;re going to try to diffuse all the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">possibilities of you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.359" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">finding a way to shape your identity</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">outside of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">um that context of strategic</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">design so yeah so there&#39;s a dire need i</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:42.159" style="s2">completely agree with john to you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">to return to these spaces of dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.159" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">and to rekindle actual teacherly</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">authority you know to rekindle these</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">contexts of</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">real socialization and uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">deep reciprocal identity shaping</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">um yep that would be that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:01.199" style="s2">it i would say it&#39;s even you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s deeper than the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.199" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">it&#39;s way deeper i mean this is an</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">existential risk thing like if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.080" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">figure out how to do this</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.000" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">then pretty much everything&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">because eventually it&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:19.120" style="s2">the inability to have real sincere</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:22.000" style="s2">earnest collective inquiry will</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.120" end="01:10:24.000" style="s2">go all the way up into all echelons of</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.000" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">institutions and then the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.000" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">you know that one outcome is war</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">right another war of all against all or</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">whatever and another outcome is just</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:36.960" style="s2">uh the degradation of actual physical</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:38.080" style="s2">and technical infrastructures because</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.960" end="01:10:40.640" style="s2">remember science</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.080" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">runs on these this kind of process it</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.640" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">has to if</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">if scientists start lying to one another</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">and everyone thinks everyone&#39;s lying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">everybody then science is actually not</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">getting done</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">uh if science is everyone&#39;s strategic</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:52.159" style="s2">against everyone else and vying for</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">funds and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.159" end="01:10:56.000" style="s2">yeah then it&#39;s not it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:59.679" style="s2">science science requires</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.000" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">uh actual earnest collective</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.679" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">inquiry um and so when that&#39;s when it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:04.880" style="s2">starts to break down the realm of</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">science that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.880" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">is that nuclear reactor actually going</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">to work or not</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">like will the electrical grid actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:14.159" style="s2">stay up or won&#39;t it uh as things get</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">more complicated we actually need to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.159" end="01:11:17.679" style="s2">preserve the space of reason to actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">solve the problems to keep our</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.679" end="01:11:24.239" style="s2">basic systems running um and</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:25.840" style="s2">uh so yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very serious</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">issue it&#39;s top top of the list and one</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">of the hardest to work on</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:34.239" style="s2">precisely because it seems uh not as</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">complicated and technical as some fancy</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.239" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">scientific problem it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:41.440" style="s2">finding ways to get people together um</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:43.440" style="s2">and so yeah the the question of how to</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:45.280" style="s2">propagate out through the field</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.440" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">these kinds of practices that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.280" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">recommending john i think is</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:51.920" style="s2">is essential um how to create pockets</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:54.960" style="s2">and culture where that</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">emerges as an attractor right where that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.960" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">becomes something to imitate</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:02.880" style="s2">is is very important</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t become it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.880" end="01:12:06.960" style="s2">lose its power or something if things</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:08.400" style="s2">get too big</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.960" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">you know if something becomes a movement</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.400" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">sometimes it loses its power so there</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">a size there seems to be a a size of of</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.400" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">how that can work like</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:19.120" style="s2">there has to be an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:22.000" style="s2">but between each person</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:22.960" style="s2">in in the problem that&#39;s trying to be be</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.000" end="01:12:24.880" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.960" end="01:12:26.000" style="s2">otherwise it becomes abstract am i</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.880" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">making sense here or</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.000" end="01:12:30.159" style="s2">am i well i think you are but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s just a size issue</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.159" end="01:12:33.840" style="s2">because you know we&#39;ve got evidence</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:35.360" style="s2">about metastable systems</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.840" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">systems can be stable at different</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.360" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">orders of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s more important to look</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:44.320" style="s2">at certain features</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">you know what&#39;s coming to mind right now</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.320" end="01:12:49.440" style="s2">is dewey&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">about the way democracy is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.440" end="01:12:52.719" style="s2">self-correcting process and science is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">self-correcting process</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.719" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">and therefore they need each other</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:58.719" style="s2">dramatically uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:13:00.480" style="s2">but but what dewey didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.719" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">understand enough or</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.480" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">maybe he did i don&#39;t want to be unfair</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:08.880" style="s2">to him but one one way</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:11.920" style="s2">you can turn this into a</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.880" end="01:13:14.560" style="s2">an issue to reflect on is well</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.920" end="01:13:16.480" style="s2">what dewey is presupposing is people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.560" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">ability to commit to</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.480" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">and value a process of self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">for its own sake</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">uh because when you have right when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">have systems like democracy</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">and science in which the process within</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:33.440" style="s2">of self-correction is considered what is</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:35.199" style="s2">valued most</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.440" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">rather than any particular product or</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:39.199" style="s2">result and the systems can actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">especially if you have two of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.199" end="01:13:42.800" style="s2">coordinated together then then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">structure can actually become</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.800" end="01:13:48.640" style="s2">quite large and complex without</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.320" end="01:13:50.080" style="s2">sort of generating um into the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">thing you&#39;re worrying about</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.080" end="01:13:53.840" style="s2">andrew the systems aren&#39;t capable of</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">metastability right but they know that</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.840" end="01:13:56.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">thing could be scaled like the catholic</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.400" end="01:14:02.719" style="s2">church a billion people</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:05.840" style="s2">or um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.719" end="01:14:07.440" style="s2">sorry to just use a more</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.840" end="01:14:09.440" style="s2">what were you going to say zach i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.440" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">going to say you like you&#39;re correct but</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">you have to like</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">almost at the level of the fractal</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">infuse the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:19.520" style="s2">thing with the with the proper</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:20.719" style="s2">weightings of what is valued as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">saying so like exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.719" end="01:14:25.040" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s a very very kind of complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">cognitive value to value process over</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:29.679" style="s2">product right which is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:32.640" style="s2">saying that like the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.679" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">people very very people within democracy</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.640" end="01:14:36.880" style="s2">need to value democratic process</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:38.800" style="s2">more than they value some particular</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:40.800" style="s2">outcome exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.800" end="01:14:42.159" style="s2">same as science right people within</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.800" end="01:14:44.719" style="s2">science need to value</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.159" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">the scientific exactly exactly i reckon</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.719" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">and so that&#39;s dewey&#39;s underlying insight</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">and he he took it up from charles</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">sanders purse who was</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:55.600" style="s2">about the ethics of inquiry that in fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:57.600" style="s2">science depends upon things like honesty</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.600" end="01:14:59.199" style="s2">cooperation and selflessness because if</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.600" end="01:15:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;re really part of science</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.199" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">then you know sign when you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.640" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">science will change and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">contributing to something that&#39;s larger</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:05.280" style="s2">than even your lifetime and you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:07.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.280" end="01:15:09.040" style="s2">making a self-transcendent move to put</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.520" end="01:15:11.920" style="s2">your life on the altar of</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:12.960" style="s2">science basically this person&#39;s idea and</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.920" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.960" end="01:15:17.440" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s uh yeah julie&#39;s due&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">point is deep but</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.440" end="01:15:20.719" style="s2">you know it is also as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">demanding and he&#39;s not yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.719" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">with a demand habermas who was was</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:25.600" style="s2">massively influenced by dewey as a youth</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:27.920" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.600" end="01:15:29.760" style="s2">uh you know just after world war ii some</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.920" end="01:15:30.640" style="s2">of the only reading materials in germany</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.760" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">were like these</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.640" end="01:15:34.480" style="s2">john dewey books that the that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:36.560" style="s2">united states military brought in</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.480" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">to indoctrinate the germans and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.560" end="01:15:41.679" style="s2">really worked</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:42.960" style="s2">and his political theory between facts</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.679" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">and values</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.960" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">between facts and norms rather uh he</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">makes the same move</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:50.560" style="s2">you know both self-regulating</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">auto-correcting systems science and</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">democratic process</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:57.600" style="s2">in the space of reasons but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:15:59.760" style="s2">specify just how demanding it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.600" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">cognitively to participate in those</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.760" end="01:16:03.760" style="s2">and in terms of in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">commitment and so there&#39;s a kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.760" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve called the cognitive maturity</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.520" end="01:16:08.320" style="s2">fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.880" end="01:16:10.960" style="s2">which ends up plaguing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.320" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2">philosophy which is the assumption that</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.960" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">uh high-level cognitive capacities are</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.000" end="01:16:16.719" style="s2">are given when they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">actually an educational achievement</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.719" end="01:16:20.800" style="s2">which may or may not be exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.640" style="s2">so um i think dewey&#39;s modeling of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.800" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">democracy and hormones</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.640" end="01:16:25.760" style="s2">basically assumes a very well</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">functioning educational system</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.760" end="01:16:30.480" style="s2">um and you know do we saw that equation</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:33.679" style="s2">and how vermont sees that equation</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.480" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">but i think uh yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.679" end="01:16:37.440" style="s2">some of what you&#39;re describing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">the condition for the body the dialogos</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.440" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">condition for the possibility of both</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">science and</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">democracy yeah so uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">zach you you you put a term to the thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">i was sort of trying to articulate about</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:52.960" style="s2">yeah what was being presupposed what</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.440" end="01:16:54.159" style="s2">what was the what did you the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.960" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">maturity fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.159" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">the cognitive maturity fallacy yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:16:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">i like that that&#39;s very tasty that could</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.800" end="01:17:02.239" style="s2">be like iq or something</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">and you find it all throughout</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.239" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">epistemology like when you read</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:09.040" style="s2">especially analytical philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:11.440" style="s2">things like that they&#39;re they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.040" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">about like you know the mind as if</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.440" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve never met a little kid</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:17.840" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah whereas psja is like</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">whoa that fall formal logic thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.840" end="01:17:21.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kick in until really late</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:23.679" style="s2">if ever by the way that people can do</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.840" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">hypothetical deductive reasoning for</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.679" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:27.520" style="s2">uh so there&#39;s this yeah as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:30.000" style="s2">developmentalist</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.520" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">i was basically saying uh the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.000" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">interesting this is a paper that i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">which will be out</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:34.960" style="s2">soon i was basically saying the most and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">one of the most interesting things about</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.960" end="01:17:37.920" style="s2">psja</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:39.199" style="s2">uh and cam wilbur to some extent is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.920" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">they don&#39;t commit the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.199" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">maturities</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:44.480" style="s2">fallacy that they actually model</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.760" end="01:17:47.520" style="s2">epistemology at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.480" end="01:17:50.159" style="s2">um and uh and then the other factor of</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.520" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">the cognitive maturity fallacy is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.159" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">uh that you have achieved maturity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">you assume mature the others that</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">there&#39;s not levels beyond your</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">is also part of the cognitive maturity</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">policy so it&#39;s an interesting concept</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">but you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen in political theorizing and</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">in other places as well where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">just an assumption that the baseline</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:12.080" style="s2">of human capacity is actually far more</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:13.520" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.080" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">and that what they&#39;re doing there what</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.520" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">they should actually do is</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">well maybe every everything&#39;s a nail</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.880" end="01:18:19.199" style="s2">when i&#39;ve got this hammer but what they</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">should actually do is</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">characterize the issue as in part also</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">an educational issue yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:28.560" style="s2">i agree i agree that in fact you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:30.560" style="s2">thinking about structures of science and</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.560" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">law and governance also requires</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.560" end="01:18:34.239" style="s2">thinking about the educational systems</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:38.080" style="s2">that produce scientists and lawyers and</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.239" end="01:18:40.400" style="s2">and politicians and if you place the bar</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">pretty high uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.400" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">in you know no pun intended with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:44.159" style="s2">legal thing if you place the bar really</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.600" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.159" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">and the education systems don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:50.239" style="s2">people there then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve failed to reproduce the you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.239" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">the the society</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:56.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the situations we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.960" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">in so yeah so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.080" end="01:19:03.600" style="s2">kind of a massive need for psycho</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">emotional cognitive triage to be run</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.600" end="01:19:07.600" style="s2">across the whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">areas the thing and the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.600" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">rolling out john seemed to be</p>
