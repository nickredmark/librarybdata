<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">and my old group um they&#39;re quite fun</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">leans on some of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">presenting kind of tech that we do as</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.599" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s the second half of this uh i</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.599" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">like we&#39;re definitely gonna record the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">first half we might not record the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">second half uh but i&#39;ll just leave the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">record on</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">but if you feel strongly uh about not</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">being uh on the recording just</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">message me privately and then i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">pause the recording at that mark</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">so that being said oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">tim i&#39;ll take you in my friend welcome</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">to oh i was trying to get tim on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">stove since this all started so i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">happy you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">yeah thank you peter it&#39;s lovely to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">here can&#39;t believe how</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">how quickly the year&#39;s gone how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">things have grown here</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">and uh yeah man it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a privilege</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">and an honor to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">um i thought i&#39;d begin just obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">saying hello to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">and um just to appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">the attention fundamentally i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">the um the background idea to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">what i want to discuss and explore</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">with you all today is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">just how much the context matters now we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">hear that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">but i mean it in the sense that um in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">preparing for this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">actually prepare what it is i truly have</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">outside of being here with you all</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">meeting the moment and finding out</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">essentially who i am</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">here that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">relevant i has something i think to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">with the imminence of life</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">and really being on the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">of who you are in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">so fundamentally what i want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">about is some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">important things to me so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">how do you begin something like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">these aren&#39;t things i can box up easily</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">you know these are the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">i i&#39;ve come to rely on in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">most difficult moments of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">you know i could say to you with honesty</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">if i was to peel back</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">myself what would there be you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">speak about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">notions like soul like what is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">you know not something you can box up</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">not something you can point at</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">you know we&#39;re doubtful it exists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">what&#39;s your epistemology what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">ontology you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">these words they are such traps at times</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">and we can forget what really matters</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">and we can forget what</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">um we really are when we are simply</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">here and present and witnessing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">of soul in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s in that sense that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">only really together here can this be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">and i expect actually in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">what i have to say might not land uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">perhaps even most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">um but the hope is that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">if we can participate in the process</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">together if we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">deeply listen then maybe there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">from me to you and between us that can</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">connect perhaps some of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">thoughts that there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">you know i used to go for um walks with</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">a good friend of mine his name&#39;s nick</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">when i was studying in england for my</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">master&#39;s it means to</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:11.280" style="s2">a mode of expression that came to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">because we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">similar conversations you know and uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">we&#39;d begin them and i would begin being</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">a point of deep understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">right you&#39;re in some sort of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">with one another things seem to fit</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">and then part of you is wondering well</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:33.840" style="s2">why can&#39;t i why can&#39;t i be right there</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">and whereas i felt so connected before</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">fit together so we&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">and then the remembering process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">not something you want to put the cart</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">before the horse with</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">right there&#39;s a certain sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">that dark garden</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">um can be illuminated but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">walk through it sort of with humility</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">and authentically again um</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">you might know some things about it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">you have to be in touch with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">something like um</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">stepping into a dark garden</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">one that i&#39;ve been in many times before</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">that i am i suppose i&#39;m proposing to do</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">and the uh the the notion in the title</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">um loving transformation is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">written about so much you know but in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">private way and uh i can&#39;t do it justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">here with you</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">i suppose because it&#39;s something well</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">actually i can you know i can do my best</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">but i don&#39;t expect to come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">completeness with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:57.199" style="s2">you know if someone was to ask me what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">fundamentally going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.199" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">and was to really push me on that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">though i had to squeeze out</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">what there is into a proposition i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">probably rest on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">loving transformation um but of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">that&#39;s just a word</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">you know they&#39;re just words and uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">perhaps we can make sense of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">it seems fundamentally we go through</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">movements as i said before of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">remembering and forgetting of um</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">holding and letting go stepping forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">being in a right relationship where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">kind of ember of truth of what we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">to express</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">like our moment of expression with</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">or activity just as it is is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">and then all of a sudden it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">maybe i need to be quiet now in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">maybe that was inaccurate maybe that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">somehow not true</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">and i have to listen i have to take in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">more information and i have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">essentially let go</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">of this mode of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">i had to the world previously and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">attach and we detach</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">you know and this language is common</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">you hear it all all around the place in</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">so something like love captures this for</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">because we might ask what is it to love</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">well in some sense it means that in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.760" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">nebulous sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">we&#39;re all connected but then people</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">argue about</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">just what that connectedness means and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">we have some sort of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">at some kind of level of development to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">understand this pattern of how we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">connected and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">but then we can think about stardust and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">different energy flows</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">through different substances affect us</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">and through which we participate</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">in ecology and all of the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">processes which give rise to us</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">and so in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">a moving processual whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">these interrelated processes that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">are as they are and give rise to us</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">through that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">what is it to be in dedication to those</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">i would say is something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">something like what is it to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">life affirming in the broadest possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">and that when we forget somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">of our connectedness connectedness to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">um whole whole making</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">in our proximal environment and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">this is akin to a cutting you know a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">forgetting as a kind of cutting</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">and um paradoxically also a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">holding on to because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">we perhaps we forget that really to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">to remember is to let go as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">you know and is to to accept a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">process of living and dying and change</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">and so i</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">i think about these things and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:56.839" style="s2">and i find them manifest most helpfully</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">not as words but as but as</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">um movement in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">the very heart of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">you might say chaos or void and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">um that&#39;s an awful lot of movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">anyway you might think just not of any</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">ordered kind it can be in coherent</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">how does the sort of but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">the matter is how the psyche kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">hangs together</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">and how um we can in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">hold hands with each other in</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">relationship to all that swirling around</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">so i don&#39;t mean to communicate by this</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">that in some sense um</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">who we are in relation to the world is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">in is uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">should be conceived only as relative</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">i actually think in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">perspective we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">um we can relate to something</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">more true and more grounded than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">and it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">in the dynamics of what enables</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">itself to endure but not from a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">what is me and mine in a fixed sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">cut but what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">well the we to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">that seems to be one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">challenges of course something i see</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">many of the conversations and sessions</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">here at the store</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">um orient around in some sense how can</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">come into relationship with something</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">greater than ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">of course unless we do this we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2"> fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">but by fact in this case i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">things might not go</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">well by ordinary measures of success</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">but perhaps in fact it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of room for deep hope</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something to the process of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">energy appropriately within and with</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">that it&#39;s like it um</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like we have this transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">accept our conditions and transcend them</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">and that doing that is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">you know we can care for each other in</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">and so an attendance to what</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">is is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">the the vitality in it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">is the direction fundamentally i</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">so something like this is is the</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">know if i&#39;ll be able to um</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">fit with the various ideas that have</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">locked into me</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">over the years to this moment here</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">but this notion of teleology is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">um most are deeply skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">you know at the moment it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">that um john viveki for instance</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">uh such a wonderful teacher he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s teleology meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">um end state or or purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">conceived as the arrival and end state</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense there that um well</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe sounding too objective like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">it was all made by</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">some sort of creator or um</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">that there&#39;s an essential essence to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">um to purpose um</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">or fittedness even and that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">um some think about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">but the way i relate to this is in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">deeply central to what it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">meaningful relationship with the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">but that it&#39;s it&#39;s not about some</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">final end point that was set before us</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">precisely but is something to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">ongoingly realized as we develop</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">in relationship with the world and each</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">and said like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s something that um john might well</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">agree with</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">but i but i i don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">that the setting of these goals</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:08.640" style="s2">that the envisioning of these end states</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.640" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">um in some sense just hanging</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">or or um entirely contingent</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">um it seems that there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:27.679" style="s2">uh appropriate orientations</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">in relationship given specific contexts</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.679" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">that develop as a result of we might say</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">culture or technology or nature levels</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">fields of possibility open up which have</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">certain kinds of niches</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">and only through a certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">ethics of interaction in this new field</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.840" style="s2">can life in the only way we can relate</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">continue i don&#39;t mean to say this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">some sort of anthropocentric sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">but it does deeply seem to be that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">ethics of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">are fundamentally bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">how it is we can realize what to aim at</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">even in the understanding that that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">to be reimagined as we go</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s nevertheless a a real</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">thing a real relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">with potential um</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">and so i think we</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">of teleology that&#39;s not to entirely be</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">put away just yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">and um and it&#39;s something like that too</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">that i work into this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">loving transformation um</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">the the inherent dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">that um enables</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">life the inherent it you can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">as almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">a will of a kind of a vital pulse</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">you know a will to life but but one that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">is not um uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">one kind of thing but has many natures</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">that interrelate</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">and find themselves in relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">so it looks to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">as we and and i should say as well that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">that everything i&#39;ve said so far i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">inviting a kind of um participatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">listening to this i&#39;m not um</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">really even suggesting that any term</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">i&#39;ve used or even</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">necessarily any conception be the one or</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">is the one that we go i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">point to that feeling or</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">that thing with with those words and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">that concept you know i&#39;m inviting that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">to the extent that anything i&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">has triggered something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">connects something for you or moves you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">to express in a way that&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">do so you know in in your own words</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">and that we enter into interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:12.840" style="s2">and come to understand what we really</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.840" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">these the words essentially are an</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">invitation this is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">some kind of um uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">the opposite thing from a definitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">talk you know where we&#39;re going to tie</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">this word to this concept and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">we&#39;re all going to relate</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">um so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">uh watching my</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">girlfriend go through different</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">processes of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">painting you know i&#39;ve taken inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">from that and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">how i&#39;ve tried to speak to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">today there are these layers of paint we</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">put down</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">and each</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">each stroke you know each each layer is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">something that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">we put energy into and we feel into</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">and we express all that we can in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">imminence</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">of that moment and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">and we can see what emerges so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">inviting fundamentally that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">paint has been haphazardly</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">thrown at the wall here you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">i&#39;m inviting you all to to share in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">and um perhaps see where we go</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">so thank you you know for being here</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">and your attention this would have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">if uh if if you weren&#39;t here and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a beautiful thing in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">so cheers peter</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">thank you tim so we&#39;re going to move to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">second portion of the evening</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">and i think i&#39;m going to return i turned</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">the record off um</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">because it makes it more i feel free us</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">um so what we&#39;re going to do we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">to have a moment of silence</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">everyone&#39;s i&#39;m going to be on on mute</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">and whoever feels sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">called to say something uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">something that felt a lie for them when</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">they were listening to him talk</p>
