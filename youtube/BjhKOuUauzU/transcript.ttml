<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">expressions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">since then i think there&#39;s been this uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">many people haven&#39;t accepted the fact</p>

<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">etc but accepting that he&#39;s won and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">how we can focus on the positives on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">to get someone to challenge um</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">to take the presidency back i think is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">more important than orange man bad trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">derangement syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">yeah i agree uh once somebody tells me</p>

<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">um they have a clear understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">what&#39;s supposed to happen in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">election i i know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">uh it&#39;s about to become a very awkward</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">conversation i have the sense we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">two candidates who both have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">iron-clad</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">argument for why they must be elected</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">and each of them is right each of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">arguments being that the other person</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">is not fit for the job</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">yes i agree and it&#39;s what you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">the lesser lesser evil or the zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">you know this it&#39;s like a an idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">illogical cold war if you will um i</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">during the cold war james baker said</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s important that we talk to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">enemies and our friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">and this these limits of absolutism</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">are morphic and complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">what we sense how we feel and experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">these limits is the epitome i think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">learning on the edge of volatile events</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">and it does feel like volatile times</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">often the tyranny of the urgent consumes</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">us and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">degenerate to to somewhat immature</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">and acting out um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">how we approach those limits and meet</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">them is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">asking newer questions and leaving</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">nuance and doubt</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">firmly in the forefront i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">i i agree with that i am uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure quite how to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">question but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve done a lot of traveling as i know</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">you have and that has given me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">different perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">on on the us than i would have if i had</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">simply been here and not ventured very</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">u.s do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">what do they miss because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">for me to say what the distortion is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">because of course i have it too yeah i</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">entered the platform uh walked in and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">had very bright shorts and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">very loud t-shirt and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">he stood there and after about 10</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">seconds he said god damn what&#39;s wrong</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">me shock and i looked around and i could</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">these uh straight-laced brits i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">probably one of them too</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">and you could see they were cracking</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">smiles and they wanted to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">you know let their personality out and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">think there is a beautiful part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">america&#39;s but i talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">america&#39;s personality and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">perceived by</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">perhaps by different nations around the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">world and i think it&#39;s in pain right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s somewhat disordered</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">in terms of the lens of how we view it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">um the one thing i find really</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">perplexing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">is the notion that we can&#39;t celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">uh the best aspects of being american</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">it seems to be i was talking with an</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">agent at a big agency the other day</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">caa here in hollywood and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">it sounded like he just detested america</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">in fact he said that china was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">their human rights uh in china and north</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">korea were better than america the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">record oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">and and and and to have these extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">conversations and hold space and listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">with curiosity and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">like where where does that come from you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">know where does this hatred of the place</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s given us all we&#39;re all immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">has given us an amazing opportunity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">a grand experiment i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something very troubling</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">about that i uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">i wonder i i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">think that that particular myopia is</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">born</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">of a positive instinct that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">to understand what we are falling short</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">on has caused us to over focus and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">imagine things about the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">world that aren&#39;t true but for anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">with a straight face that our</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">human rights record is um you know falls</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">short of china or north korea is to just</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">evidence a complete</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">failure of awareness of what is taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">place elsewhere in the world i mean for</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">all of our faults</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">we are uh well ahead of those two oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">very much so i you know i rem i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">images from decades ago in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">east of the burning of the american flag</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">and the outrage in america at how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">event was perceived when viewed and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">recently seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">americans burning the american flag</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">outside the white house</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">and i think there is reason to be upset</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">angry and to protest and to come</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">uh that level i i</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">just can&#39;t i can&#39;t get my head around</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">no it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">sensibilities of the moment actually are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">placing the american experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s possible that these people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">have this warped view</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">of of the u.s are going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">get to test their hypothesis and see</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">what life is like</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">fear is that they&#39;re not even honest</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">enough with themselves to remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">what they thought that at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">it becomes clear what they&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">they will imagine that they were always</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">on the right side of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">rather than even just honestly tracking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">uh their change in viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">yeah i think there comes a point there</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">does come a point where you have to</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">there is no comparison yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">serious flaws and there is serious</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">unfairness but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">you know are far closer to having gotten</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">than having gotten it so wrong there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">no hope for repair</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">so i i just can&#39;t believe we&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">reverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">course rather than uh you know to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">redouble our efforts in making this the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">fair and wonderful place that it has</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">always aspired to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">well maybe we&#39;re in that uh deep valley</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">that you and i talked about with regards</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">to the uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">the adaptive landscape model and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">jumping the discourse gap</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">and um we&#39;re finding ways to i mean look</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">the problem i have being a classical</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">liberal is that i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">liberalism at its core is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">willingness to hear other voices i may</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">not agree with them but the true liberal</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">welcomes the provocation and does not</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">retreat from it</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">um we want to come together and have</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">critical be more critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">you know how can we how can we find</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">solutions rather than focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">and intend to the problems and find</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">better solutions and get to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">the peaks how do we do we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">peak</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">whatever that peak is well i also think</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">something is missing</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">because even as you describe it there i</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">mean i know you and i are of like mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">about this and that we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">a parallel experience but i think people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">that talking to people who have a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">different perspective is like taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">medicine and the experience of actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">totally the opposite right i actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">quite enjoy the conversations that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">have with people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.560" style="s2">who can explain to me how the political</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">landscape looks very different to them</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.560" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">or how the the scientific landscape</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">looks different</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">those conversations are very</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">rewarding and conversation with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">who shares your viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">can be reassuring but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">broaden your understanding nearly so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">and so i i really wish i could just let</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">in on not only the uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">the analytical experience but the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">that accompanies being able to cross</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">some big</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">gap that is famously supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">unbridgeable and discovering a human</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">being that you actually like on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">yeah and and learning something and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">taking something away from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">conversation and growing and modifying</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">your belief system and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">um reminds me of a poem i wrote called</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">grave matters all</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">judgments passed on others belonging the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">court of self</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">take not a part of the blame accept not</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">projections of shame</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">blame pastor others is judgment passed</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">self to begin a sentence of revenge dig</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">two graves</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">eventually we all end up in the happy</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">ever afterwards of our emotional</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">so you know how can we look to self and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">you know the involution of self and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">evolve that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">better sense of i don&#39;t know it all i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">so i&#39;ve said this to you before</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">like the more i learn the more i realize</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s stupefying it&#39;s like going</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">finding the clearing in the lungs of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">forest and then realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this massive expanse of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">new forests ahead and new journeys and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">trails to go on</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">that&#39;s opening up to possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">what an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">i mean just glorious i i totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">um that people in general they just seem</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">at least what i feel is the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">reaction but the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">that there is a great deal you do not</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">know is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">it&#39;s an invitation it&#39;s uh it means that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">there is profit to be made that you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">and so you should be happy at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">discovery because</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">who knows what you&#39;ll find out rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">than just constantly reassuring yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it nailed and it&#39;s all uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">very simple and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">the trick is just to force other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">to see it that can&#39;t be very fun</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">no we we have to have a bit of serious</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">play i mean it can be serious but we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">have to have a good play</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">i mean a lot of my work in my career has</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">been improvised and in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">off the cuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">and living on that phenomenological edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">the razor&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">not just the bleeding edge or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">too many edges in there</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">um but how we how we can add a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">artistry</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">and flavor and fun and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">um maybe take a bit of dr carl young and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">mix it up with dr zeus</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">and um present it in a way that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t too</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">serious and uh and studious</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">we we do need the the serious and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">studious and the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">legislative you know legalese etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">i think we you and i have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">how we came together</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">and how how much respect i have for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">and the work you do and the podcast that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">you did with uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">your brother being one of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">uh podcast episodes i&#39;ve ever heard on</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">the portal it was just so genuinely real</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">and authentic and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">brotherhood</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">of weinstein was on auditory display</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">yeah um yeah we uh it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know when we first became</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">aware of each other i guess it&#39;s been uh</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">thought crimes are now part of the law</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">in england and the understanding of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">with the respondent and why i started</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">the respondent is to try and just</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">um smashed the patriarchy all men bad</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">but some i think were caught up</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">particularly in my business in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">entertainment industry</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">without uh due process and</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">of the sky towards which they climb and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">routes which can tort themselves</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s brilliant the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">issue of what is happening to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">masculinity is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">so dire and you know you say</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">that some people were tried in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">court of public opinion and then tried</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">in an actual court</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">and others were just tried in the court</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">of public opinion but even more</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">distressing than that is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">some people were tried</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">in the court of public opinion for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t even wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s guilty till proven more</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">guilty</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">not even guilty till we&#39;re even innocent</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">or innocent or proven guilty</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">and that is what really concerns</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">me particularly in the area of family</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">is one place um you know the respondent</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">deals with</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">with the familial bond the familial</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">tapestry of how we</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">being bad and were bombarded by messages</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">about the deeply corrosive effects of</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">is toxic that men are bad uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">man&#39;s kindness is extinct chivalry is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">bygone notion</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">and particularly in the family law</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s rife with outdated gender ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">every bit of sexist</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">as those faced by women in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">other arenas past and present and we</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">have a lot of thoughts on it myself and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:03.399" style="s2">i believe</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">but that that renegotiation</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">would be insane to implement some kind</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">to enforce it in any way in other words</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">i believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">strongly that there are features of</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:47.120" style="s2">we should not expect men to be</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">masculinity is um</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">a hazard or is inherently bad or</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">the fact is straight women do not like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">weak men and so if you induce</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">your boys to become weak you&#39;re setting</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">them up for</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">before and i i couldn&#39;t agree more that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">how the the mother and father if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">talking in in simple terms or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:14.799" style="s2">matriarch and the patriarch negotiate</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.799" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">of parenting i think is is so that the</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">take risks</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">but not risks that will kill or severely</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s vital i remember the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">first time my son squared off</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">to fight physically and i reassured my</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">wife at the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">that it was a necessary rite of passage</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">and as our youngest</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">i think he was six maybe at the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">and my eldest was eight there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">two-year age gap</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">they needed that experience that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">prideful moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">uh he needed the younger brother because</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve been the younger brother</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">of taking his elder brother on and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">even teaching him a lesson</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">in the process which he did a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">and she was still somewhat distressed as</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">i led the boys into the back garden or</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">backyard</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">and created this imaginary boxing ring</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">although she did she trusted well trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">is important it&#39;s vital she trusted me</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">enough to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">to calm her understandable mother bear</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">uh to believe that i might know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">better how to handle this rush of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">testosterone situation and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">balanced parenting</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">cannot take place if men and fathers</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t present there must be a balanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">or renegotiation as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">i say the spirit level of the sexes in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:45.640" style="s2">order for boys to become more fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">formed</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.640" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">self-actualized young men take those</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">rights of passage with a deeper more</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">imagined sense of healthy boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">so that they can eventually alone</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">take those steps to start to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">like men responsibility equals reward</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">feel like boys risk taking equals</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">ambition</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">and i think more we can advocate</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">fatherhood you know advocating</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">fatherhood is not about</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">admonishing or diminishing motherhood i</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">believe a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">primary role of a father or one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">primary roles is to maintain an</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">aura a presence if you will which says</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">and listen son life has problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna solve that problem together</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">one day</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">um you&#39;ll have you&#39;ll have your</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">you&#39;ll leave home and and be playing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">more seriously on your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">with your own little children</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">uh boys of your own maybe or friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">sons and daughters to play with</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">tend to be responsible for let&#39;s prepare</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">for that day</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">to learn how to confidently and sensibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">risk take together and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">vital for boys to learn</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">through the eyes and the experience and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">reflected from a father and to learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">boundary setting</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">self-discipline um and how to instill a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">empathy for themselves their partners</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">peers and friends</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">and eventually um you know their</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">ultimate partner</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">hopefully and when the testosterone in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">boys is not channeled well</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">boys become destructive and when</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">father&#39;s not present in the family home</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:33.679" style="s2">to instruct</p>

<p begin="00:34:33.679" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">channeled well</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">boys become constructive so why</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">aren&#39;t we advocating why aren&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">positive masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">positive father figures fathers role</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">more so that we can leave a legacy for</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">for the younger generations that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">leave behind</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">so i want to connect a couple threads if</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">i can manage to do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">um your your theme about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">constructive</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">aspect of masculinity is very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">and near and dear to my</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">heart and i have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">that we are very complex creatures i</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">a fact and that what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">the way things are hooked together</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">is often not obvious and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">tendency</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">this uh chesterton&#39;s fence problem where</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">obvious gets removed because a strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">argument can be made that it&#39;s somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">antiquated and that very frequently we</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">are living</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">the harm that arises from having</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">vital without realizing we were doing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:51.800" style="s2">and what i see</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">on this topic is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.800" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">renegotiated the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">sex and that those rules of sex</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">basically we are told that any</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">resistance to just</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">getting laid and not thinking about the</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">is somehow um oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">and that the discovery that sex is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">a biological drive and that you should</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">follow it where it leads you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">than it is and all of that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">reason even really to give a damn about</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">the person</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">consequences of this are many</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:33.920" style="s2">and one of them is that it puts males</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">in one of two modes and it&#39;s not the one</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">that we should want</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">to flourish right men have always had</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">to spread their seed without taking</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">and that is not men at their best that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">men at their worst</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">and the problem the reason that we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">now hearing about toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">is that in a world where men have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">told that that part of them is just fine</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">and they should</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">you know activate it is a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">to women because the men are viewing</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">them as targets</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">rather than as partners and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">in that world there&#39;s this temptation to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">then write the rules that make</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">women safe to be around men rather than</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">writing rules in which men are</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">prone to behave more honorably because</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">and i guess the final thing i would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.119" style="s2">on this is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">in a world where sex had not been</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">and where it was therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">difficult to come by and required real</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">investment by men in order to persuade</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">men moved mountains in order to impress</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">the women</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">that they were most interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">that was a process that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">tremendously powerful and the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">are now frequently satisfiable with a</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">is resulting i think in a great deal of</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">just being absolutely squandered because</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">well put very well put more well better</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">better well put than i could have uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">have talked about i you know i i i</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">for the respondent later in the season</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">it reminds me of</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">courts and decided that she would</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">try harder to help men and when i found</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">at all then has 30 days</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">course there are cases where</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">there are uh men who we can say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">deserve that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">and probably women who don&#39;t deserve</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve talked in at length about</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">nikki crick&#39;s study on</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">um the differences between character</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">traits and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">between women and and men and the female</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">and the male</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">whereas men move faster to physical</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">um violence women</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">they they get past it men get past it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">quicker and move on we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">move to what she called reputation</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">savaging</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">and how we can find a place</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">where um where more</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">fathers and sons are connected less</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">families are</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">raised less children are growing up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">in single parent families</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">and we can understand that not all dads</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">are dead broke dads many of them are</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">dead beat dads many of them are dead</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.800" style="s2">broke dads because</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">of the system and i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.800" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">major</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">uh for me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">huge area in our legal system that needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">reformation i&#39;m i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">later today with molly olsen who who was</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">she led the drive for</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">equal shared parenting or um default</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">shared parenting</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">in uh minnesota i believe there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">states that have that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">and that has fundamentally changed not</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">only the face of family law</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">it reduces obviously the attorney&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:29.119" style="s2">money there&#39;s less incentive for them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">be able to churn</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.119" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">but it also brings half of that family</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">when a child is erased or a father or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">mother is a raised</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">half of their extended family is gone</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">and are raised</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">too this can&#39;t be good for our</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">communal collective it cannot be good</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">and understandably we focus on you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">issues at the border and the separation</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">of families</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">i wonder why we don&#39;t place more focus</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">or as much focus i should say on</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">our legal system and our families</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">who are being torn apart because of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">and our children</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">particularly our boys you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">talked about education and um</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">you know in the in the prison system and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">in education</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">there were just so many areas that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">could really improve on i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">yes we uh have lost sight of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">features of a functional society and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">now treat them as</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">aesthetic which is most unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">so i it you know i think one has to look</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">at all of the the tropes the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">tropes</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">surrounding um</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">mayor you know children out of wedlock</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s something very antiquated</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">about the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">children should only occur within a</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">and you know i think that we think this</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">is antiquated because the notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">was prior to the invention of reliable</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">birth control and so of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">reliable birth control made it possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">to have sex and not produce children and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">therefore it meant sex could precede</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">marriage more frequently than it would</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">have in the past because</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">women of course are wired to fear</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">producing children without a partner</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">because of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">children are so expensive i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">expensive financially but</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">so intensive to raise that a partner is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">a necessary feature</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">right it is a much harder job to raise a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">child alone</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">but at some level in the renegotiation</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">we lost sight of the fact that actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">has an overriding interest</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">in making sure that children are well</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">and that well-raised children are much</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">more likely in a household that has two</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">parents and part of the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">is because that household has more than</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">two parents it has two extended families</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">and we don&#39;t frankly even know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">extent to which</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">having two parents is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">a necessary way to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">the navigation of being human even</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">occurs</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">right to have two parents is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">guarantee that there will</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">be two people in your lives in your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">have distinct opinions on things</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">and then you as a child growing up in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">that environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">will learn of the two perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">you will have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">how to weigh them in a single parent</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">household that is much less</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">likely and so i&#39;m not telling you i know</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">the answer to this at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">but i am telling you that at least we</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">ought to be able to identify the value</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">two-parent household is not really an</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">optional thing it&#39;s not aesthetic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">and just in the same way the state</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">sees it as it within its interest to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:02.839" style="s2">make sure that a child is well nourished</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">is mentally well nourished less</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">yeah no and i&#39;m dismayed at the tenor of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">much of the discussion that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">place about the nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">marriage appears to my eyes to be the to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">be on life support and i see</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">and uh read many um</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">many people who appear to be happy about</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">that even while a backbone narrative of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">or panic democracy we&#39;re living through</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">the statistics reveal a decay of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">marriage as a foundational institution</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">as i write this the wall street</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">of marriages says nothing of quality</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">is important you and i have talked about</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">so in places where a man</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">is unlikely to be certain that the</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">actually we know just evolutionarily the</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">of a failure of information a lack of</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">way to get there</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">yeah very much so all of the statistics</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.359" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">that that a child a boy raised in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">a two-parent family household is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">to have</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">their own life and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">where did we get to a place brett where</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">did we get to a place in our society</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">that the value of life has become</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">extinct people just so many people just</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">you hear about someone taking their life</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">and uh he deserved it she deserved it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">well good riddance</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">really and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">you know going back to man and fathers</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">those men and fathers haven&#39;t had</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">and sisters and daughters</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">we&#39;re all in this together</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">it just i&#39;ve read the notes i&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">the suicide notes from the fathers</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">the good men you know not the bad men</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">the ones who just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:50.079" style="s2">you know run along and be the casanova</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">and procreate and then move along um</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.079" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">and that they&#39;re heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve talked to the men who have</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">have been at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">of life living on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">existential</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">terror and angst you know trauma resides</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">in the body</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">and the body keeps the score to quote uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">bessel van der kulk&#39;s beautiful book</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">and how that inescapability</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">not just not just of a father removed</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">from</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really what one of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">goals is</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">to meet and innovate these through these</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">yeah you know i was uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">heather and i were watching with our</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">older son uh the big short</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">last night and there&#39;s a very eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">speech in the end of it where the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">main character</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">the michael baum character is describing</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">the effect he saw of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">wall street on the people who inhabit it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">and that basically it turned them</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">inhuman</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">by virtue of putting them so closely in</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">contact with the functioning</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">of markets that it became</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">all of the stuff that&#39;s harder to defend</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">and harder to describe</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">falls away because the stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">the balance sheet is so clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">and i think that there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">the idea that what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">is that markets which initially</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">facilitated the production</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">of value became</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:07.040" style="s2">subtly empowered to commodify everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">even the things that should never have</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.040" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">been allowed</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">to have been commodified and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">this uh expendability that you describe</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:17.839" style="s2">is really the consequence of that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.839" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">uh view everything you know the fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">in order to figure out what to charge</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">you for insurance</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">or what to pay your relatives if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">killed you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">assesses your value on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">calculation</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">on the other hand there&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">wrong with that calculation right</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:43.920" style="s2">i agree yeah it um</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">i remember reading uh joseph campbell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.920" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">book the hero with a thousand faces</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">and um soon after i read that book i</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">wrote a poem and the poem was a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">short poem</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">and it was about the year that were</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">i thought about gravestones and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">year that were born</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">and the year that we die you know i</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">think in uh perhaps it&#39;s the mexican</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">uh in the mexican culture it said we</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">have three deaths</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">and the one the first death is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">moment that we realize that we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">mortal</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">we fully face our mortality and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">second death</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">is the last breath we exhale if and when</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:25.359" style="s2">we realize we&#39;re on our way out and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">third death</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.359" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">is the last time our name is mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">on earth</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">and i heard that</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">and i thought about the gravestone and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:40.000" style="s2">that dash</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">that means that the partner who isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">knows exactly where they&#39;re headed right</p>

<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:16.079" style="s2">you have to search farther afield and so</p>

<p begin="01:05:22.160" end="01:05:28.799" style="s2">to me free verse has the same kind of</p>

<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">um of course well i have i i have uh</p>

<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">of all the thing about the rules</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:02.880" style="s2">is knowing how to break them i&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">breaking the rules</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.880" end="01:07:06.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m not for breaking the rules just</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.000" end="01:07:09.119" style="s2">how can you break the rules if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:12.079" style="s2">know them though well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.119" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">well for one thing i wouldn&#39;t call what</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.079" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">you have just</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:16.960" style="s2">recited here free verse now maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">technically it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.960" end="01:07:21.039" style="s2">but the thing is there&#39;s some and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">fact maybe we should get to the code at</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.039" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">some point but</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">you clearly have some kind of a highly</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">regimented linguistic code and maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">surrounds</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">more meaning than it does meter and</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">so maybe you&#39;re free verse with respect</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">to meter and rhyme</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">but what you&#39;re saying is it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:51.760" style="s2">meaning and emotion imbued into it the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">way a pianist</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.760" end="01:07:56.079" style="s2">can imbue a piece with emotion by the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">way they play</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.079" end="01:07:59.599" style="s2">and you actually can see it in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">the physical</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.599" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">interaction with the piano so anyway i</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">um it&#39;s possible that my category is too</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">narrow but my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:13.599" style="s2">you are engaging a kind of uh regimented</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:15.599" style="s2">requirement for your poetry at least</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.599" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">according to what you&#39;ve said here</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.599" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">that uh is not troubling to me in the</p>

<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:26.880" style="s2">why thank you um i yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">the expression i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.880" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">emotional expression</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">and how we can vocalize the poetry and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">and the performance and who is</p>

<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">to my mind pre-ordained beforehand and</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">and i have no um</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">no for a fact it&#39;s just based on</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.760" end="01:16:56.080" style="s2">seen and witnessed there was there is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.000" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">really disturbing</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.080" end="01:17:00.239" style="s2">dystopia at play where the power mongers</p>

<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:10.960" style="s2">they&#39;re doing the quite the opposite in</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.960" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">rooms and in private oh i agree and i</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.600" end="01:17:18.880" style="s2">think there&#39;s already an agreement</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.360" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">for biden to step down and that the dnc</p>

<p begin="01:17:21.280" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2">to which of course is</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.080" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">an absolutely frightening transition in</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.480" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">the way governance</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:32.960" style="s2">works even as dysfunctional as it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:36.159" style="s2">this is a new level of dysfunction</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.960" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">so how is a question and on</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.159" end="01:17:43.679" style="s2">one level the answer is so obvious</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">and i think those of us if you see</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.679" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">as i alluded to before each</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">candidate has an iron-clad argument</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">for their election and that is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">unacceptability of the other</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">and they are both right and for</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">anybody if you see only one of their</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:02.880" style="s2">arguments and the other one is in your</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:05.120" style="s2">blind spot</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.880" end="01:18:07.040" style="s2">then you will say oh well the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.120" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">what we have to do is simply clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.040" end="01:18:13.199" style="s2">right you will say either we can&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">biden to drag this woke insanity</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.199" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">into the white house because that will</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.560" end="01:18:20.159" style="s2">destroy america and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:22.560" style="s2">true on the other hand we cannot allow</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.760" end="01:18:34.239" style="s2">too dangerous to even contemplate so</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.040" end="01:18:36.159" style="s2">at the point that you see both sides</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.239" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">and not just the one you understand that</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.159" end="01:18:39.120" style="s2">each one is unacceptable and the answer</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:42.480" style="s2">is well</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.120" end="01:18:44.000" style="s2">what would we have to do in order to not</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.480" end="01:18:45.440" style="s2">elect either of them and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">all you have to do is believe that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.440" end="01:18:48.400" style="s2">possible and what makes it possible is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">lot of people believing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.400" end="01:18:51.520" style="s2">possible so</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">how about we have that conversation of</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.520" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">belief now</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:58.880" style="s2">we learn that as we&#39;ve been taught by</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.320" style="s2">2020 so many times already and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.880" end="01:19:03.040" style="s2">only halfway through</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.320" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">the impossible is just around the corner</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.040" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">if we can just simply talk ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:09.920" style="s2">into saying well</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:10.560" style="s2">the two major parties forced us into</p>

<p begin="01:19:10.560" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">they gave us non-viable options which</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.120" end="01:19:16.880" style="s2">requires us to ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">what else can we do we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.880" end="01:19:21.440" style="s2">something else and</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">it is simply it is ours</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.440" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">to take back the white house and from</p>

<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">and there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.199" end="01:19:42.880" style="s2">uh there is an urgency i mean i talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">about the tyranny of the urgent</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.880" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">that um you know i think about the</p>

<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">and really a very tiny fringe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.360" end="01:22:17.840" style="s2">bossing around</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">giant corporations um individuals that</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.320" end="01:22:30.080" style="s2">people are solving their own problems</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.000" end="01:22:32.960" style="s2">and that looks like</p>

<p begin="01:22:32.960" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">of cowardice</p>

<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:39.600" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.360" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">taking a risk to say what you do believe</p>

<p begin="01:22:45.440" end="01:22:48.639" style="s2">and i think you know this is a small</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:52.560" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.639" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">but you and i both believe that the</p>

<p begin="01:22:55.840" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">we have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:01.520" style="s2">uh consider things like the unity 2020</p>

<p begin="01:23:01.520" end="01:23:07.600" style="s2">and we actually take a risk in so saying</p>

<p begin="01:23:07.600" end="01:23:11.360" style="s2">looking foolish we are risking being</p>

<p begin="01:23:11.360" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">either of which will be terrible and i</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.679" end="01:23:18.320" style="s2">think the point is well</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:18.880" style="s2">people who have preceded us have given</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.320" end="01:23:22.239" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:24.080" style="s2">far more to protect the nation this is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.239" end="01:23:26.800" style="s2">small price to pay</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.080" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">and it can be distributed if more people</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.800" end="01:23:29.280" style="s2">join</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:31.199" style="s2">the clearer it will be that actually we</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.280" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">do have an opportunity to do something</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.199" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">outside of the script</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:39.840" style="s2">and really at some level if you get it</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t have much of a choice we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.840" end="01:23:45.679" style="s2">been delivered unacceptable options</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:48.159" style="s2">the cost will fall heaviest on</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.679" end="01:23:48.800" style="s2">the young who have longer to live in its</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.159" end="01:23:51.120" style="s2">shadow</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.800" end="01:23:52.639" style="s2">it will fall heaviest on those who are</p>

<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:04.560" style="s2">so uh everything</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.880" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">that we hold dear</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.560" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">and just a simple fact of compassion for</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:11.920" style="s2">those who are vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:13.760" style="s2">seems to require us to demand something</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.920" end="01:24:17.199" style="s2">different and it&#39;s time for people to</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.760" end="01:24:20.400" style="s2">stand up i agree</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.199" end="01:24:23.920" style="s2">and i hope more more and more people</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.400" end="01:24:27.040" style="s2">uh find their voice and their clarity</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.920" end="01:24:29.280" style="s2">and join together and um</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.040" end="01:24:30.880" style="s2">you know and and aren&#39;t too afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.280" end="01:24:33.440" style="s2">being told</p>

<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:38.239" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to elect this person</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:41.600" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.239" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">um get behind this person because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.600" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">the only</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">well one of the beautiful things about</p>

<p begin="01:24:55.280" end="01:24:58.800" style="s2">happened in england with brexit</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.199" end="01:25:01.679" style="s2">and i think we saw a large portion of</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.960" end="01:26:40.960" style="s2">trying to find a way to rally his troops</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.880" end="01:26:43.120" style="s2">and strategize how we would win this</p>

<p begin="01:28:41.760" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">there&#39;s no guarantee but in a moment</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.360" end="01:28:49.040" style="s2">where it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.480" style="s2">obvious it could be obvious to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.040" end="01:28:52.080" style="s2">that the country is on the verge of</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.480" end="01:28:54.560" style="s2">tearing itself apart</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.080" end="01:28:55.760" style="s2">it seems to me that our patriotic</p>

<p begin="01:28:55.760" end="01:28:59.840" style="s2">is unity and that the only position that</p>

<p begin="01:28:59.840" end="01:29:05.120" style="s2">matter what comes succeed or fail</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.000" end="01:29:06.800" style="s2">is to have tried anybody who didn&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.120" end="01:29:08.719" style="s2">in this moment who couldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.719" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">different possibility</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:14.159" style="s2">despite the fact that the major parties</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">announced that they were unwilling to</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.159" end="01:29:17.840" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">anybody who can&#39;t figure it out now wow</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.840" end="01:29:21.120" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.880" end="01:29:22.719" style="s2">i just i have a hopeless feeling about</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.120" end="01:29:23.440" style="s2">what that must be like and i would say</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.719" end="01:29:26.080" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.440" end="01:29:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s time to to wake up and get to work</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.080" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">yeah i agree and i think that answers</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.520" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">the why</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:32.480" style="s2">question and he who has a why can bear</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:34.480" style="s2">anyhow</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.480" end="01:29:36.480" style="s2">so the how gets answered after the the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.480" end="01:29:39.600" style="s2">why i think that was roomy</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.480" end="01:29:42.719" style="s2">so you know answer the why um</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.600" end="01:29:43.520" style="s2">do not question the why just answer the</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.719" end="01:29:46.880" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.520" end="01:29:47.760" style="s2">for why is the answer and if we can find</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.880" end="01:29:51.440" style="s2">a way</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.760" end="01:29:54.880" style="s2">to come together and um</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.440" end="01:29:56.639" style="s2">really galvanize uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.880" end="01:29:59.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing just even the word</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.639" end="01:29:59.920" style="s2">unity i mean come on</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.120" end="01:30:04.800" style="s2">don&#39;t we all want a little more unity</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:07.040" style="s2">and unification</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.800" end="01:30:08.639" style="s2">it just feels good to even think in that</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.040" end="01:30:09.840" style="s2">framework at this moment it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.639" end="01:30:12.239" style="s2">liberating to do it</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.840" end="01:30:14.000" style="s2">and i must say i i like your formulation</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.239" end="01:30:15.679" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.000" end="01:30:18.840" style="s2">that you should answer the why and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.679" end="01:30:20.320" style="s2">how will follow that&#39;s really how things</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.840" end="01:30:23.040" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.320" end="01:30:24.880" style="s2">the why motivates the how if you start</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.040" end="01:30:28.960" style="s2">with the how</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.880" end="01:30:30.880" style="s2">uh you may well spin your wheels</p>

<p begin="01:30:37.520" end="01:30:41.679" style="s2">how how the why needs to be answered i</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.560" end="01:30:43.199" style="s2">think it was before</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.679" end="01:30:44.639" style="s2">the how and the rest of it and many</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.199" end="01:30:46.080" style="s2">companies start from the out the</p>
