<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">Gotama and we began by looking at his</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">we began by taking a look at his early</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.549" end="00:03:11.099" style="s2">life within the palace we stepped aside</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">and examined the palace as a</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">particular existential mode we talked</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.609" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">are needs that are met by becoming</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:01.799" style="s2">then talked about the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">modal confusion being locked in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.799" end="00:04:06.630" style="s2">having mode in trying to meet your being</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:11.220" style="s2">needs within the having mode so trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.630" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">to meet your need for maturity by having</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.220" end="00:04:17.789" style="s2">a car or meeting your need for being in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:20.910" style="s2">love by having lots of sex and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.789" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">about the fact that you can get in gate</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.910" end="00:04:25.710" style="s2">you can become a meshed in modal</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:27.539" style="s2">confusion and how that becomes a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.710" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">cycle because as your being needs are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.539" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">frustrated you pursue evermore the miss</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:37.610" style="s2">framed projects that the modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:39.979" style="s2">is giving you you try</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.610" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">more to have things as opposed to more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.979" end="00:04:45.259" style="s2">and more become what you need to become</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:49.060" style="s2">and then I suggested to you that being</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.259" end="00:04:51.050" style="s2">in the palace is a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.060" end="00:04:53.240" style="s2">representation of this kind of modal</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.050" end="00:04:55.669" style="s2">confusion in which we are stuck in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.240" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">having mode and of course this also had</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.669" end="00:04:59.689" style="s2">one important cultural point and I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">say at the beginning that we would talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.689" end="00:05:03.379" style="s2">about that we would develop a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:05.449" style="s2">talking about the connections between</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.379" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">the meaning crisis and other crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.449" end="00:05:10.819" style="s2">are facing so issues about a market</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">economy and a commodification of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.819" end="00:05:16.520" style="s2">everything and everyone by inducing</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">modal confusion it is possible to sell</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:24.289" style="s2">you more and as your identity becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:27.500" style="s2">more and more a political and economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.289" end="00:05:30.289" style="s2">thing and commodity that should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.500" end="00:05:32.449" style="s2">categorically understood and manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:34.669" style="s2">the more and more I can sell you things</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.449" end="00:05:37.460" style="s2">and sell you ideas and manipulate you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.669" end="00:05:40.550" style="s2">accordingly so this has important</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.460" end="00:05:44.300" style="s2">ramifications for us now that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.550" end="00:05:49.009" style="s2">a myth because it has important</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.300" end="00:05:52.069" style="s2">ramifications for us right now but as I</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.009" end="00:05:55.940" style="s2">mentioned Siddhartha does not stay in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.069" end="00:05:57.379" style="s2">the palace he is his curiosity becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.940" end="00:06:01.069" style="s2">too great and there are all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.379" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">variations on this story and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.069" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">think there is an absolute canonical way</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">of saying it but he decides to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">policy goes out in his chariot with his</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:15.259" style="s2">charioteer Chandra and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:22.879" style="s2">travelling around and he sees a sick</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.259" end="00:06:26.599" style="s2">person and he&#39;s distressed what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.879" end="00:06:29.770" style="s2">with that person what he&#39;s and Chandra</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.599" end="00:06:33.379" style="s2">says My lordy he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s sick and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.770" end="00:06:36.349" style="s2">said Arsenal what did he do to cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.379" end="00:06:38.060" style="s2">that and it&#39;s like nothing that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.349" end="00:06:40.219" style="s2">it it happens to everybody everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.060" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">gets sick at some point it&#39;s just part</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.219" end="00:06:44.900" style="s2">of the way of things you can see this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.459" style="s2">like this is the axial Awakening right</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.900" end="00:06:49.159" style="s2">remember the axial revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.459" end="00:06:50.009" style="s2">awakening about what&#39;s actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.159" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">in the soft</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.009" end="00:06:58.680" style="s2">in the world and so siddharta is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:07:01.080" style="s2">very distressed it&#39;s like what but you I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.680" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">could get sick too and Chandra said well</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.080" end="00:07:04.830" style="s2">of course of course I mean part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.330" end="00:07:07.050" style="s2">conceit of the myth is that Chandra is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.830" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">sort of oblivious to sit hard his whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.050" end="00:07:13.259" style="s2">history which is of course unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s that&#39;s the point of a myth to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.259" end="00:07:17.779" style="s2">get you to realize things not to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:20.189" style="s2">convince you about historical truths so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.779" end="00:07:21.149" style="s2">sit artists distressed and he says take</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.189" end="00:07:22.979" style="s2">me away from here I don&#39;t want I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.149" end="00:07:26.909" style="s2">want to see this anymore and so they dry</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.979" end="00:07:31.559" style="s2">they drive along and right they meet an</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:32.529" style="s2">talk about this why is it after people</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.300" end="00:12:34.839" style="s2">have these kinds of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.529" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">experiences they feel that they need to</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.180" end="00:12:43.720" style="s2">irreversible about it this is something</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:46.149" style="s2">we&#39;re going to directly talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.720" end="00:12:49.240" style="s2">fact can we get a cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.149" end="00:12:53.940" style="s2">purchase on that but he can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.240" end="00:12:53.940" style="s2">the disillusionment is too real</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.380" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">so he decides to leave and this this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:06.200" style="s2">not an easy choice he has a wife he has</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:07.850" style="s2">a child and we may in fact even</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.200" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">ethically criticize him</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.850" end="00:13:15.650" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s abandoning his son he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:19.220" style="s2">abandoning his wife but there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.650" end="00:13:22.130" style="s2">here that and and of course we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.220" end="00:13:27.020" style="s2">make moral reflection we should make</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.130" end="00:13:29.870" style="s2">moral arguments but what the myth is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.020" end="00:13:34.250" style="s2">saying is the moral life sits upon</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.870" end="00:13:36.550" style="s2">something deeper they&#39;re carrying out</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.250" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">your moral responsibilities well</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.550" end="00:13:47.380" style="s2">important of course can ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:52.790" style="s2">rendered meaningless if you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.380" end="00:13:57.050" style="s2">meaning morality sits on depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.790" end="00:13:58.190" style="s2">your life being meaningful and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.050" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">going to talk about this a lot later</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.190" end="00:14:02.150" style="s2">when we talk about the work of Susan</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:05.720" style="s2">wolf and others the meaning in life and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.150" end="00:14:07.580" style="s2">then within the psychological work about</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.720" end="00:14:09.650" style="s2">this right now meaning in life is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.580" end="00:14:12.860" style="s2">different from and I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.650" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">this myth says is deeper than simply</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.860" end="00:14:19.250" style="s2">leading a moral existence they see</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:25.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something more to wisdom than</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.250" end="00:14:30.170" style="s2">just morality see virtue is also about</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.870" end="00:14:34.940" style="s2">right that that that meaningfulness that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.170" end="00:14:36.970" style="s2">meta meaning it&#39;s ultimately about being</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.940" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">plugged into the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.970" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">not just doing what is morally correct</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.080" end="00:14:51.080" style="s2">so Siddhartha leaves the pile he cuts</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.100" end="00:14:55.820" style="s2">his hair leaves the palace goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.080" end="00:15:00.760" style="s2">forest and he decides to follow the path</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.820" end="00:15:06.470" style="s2">of the renouncers and try to cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.760" end="00:15:09.500" style="s2">solution to the fear and the turmoil Ida</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.470" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">still reverberating within him so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.500" end="00:15:15.770" style="s2">he pursues various he meets up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:20.540" style="s2">various teachers and he pursues various</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.770" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">things but he gets into he gets into</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.540" end="00:15:25.370" style="s2">another troubled spot because although</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:27.160" style="s2">he leaves the palace there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.370" end="00:15:29.750" style="s2">important sense of which he hasn&#39;t left</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.160" end="00:15:31.870" style="s2">they&#39;re having mode because he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.750" end="00:15:33.770" style="s2">he&#39;s still carrying that confusion</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.870" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">because what he&#39;s pursuing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.770" end="00:15:41.690" style="s2">pursuing asceticism he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">subject to the body to tremendous trial</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.690" end="00:15:49.130" style="s2">and pain trying to bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:52.280" style="s2">complete submission so he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.130" end="00:15:53.660" style="s2">practicing self-denial I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.280" end="00:15:55.730" style="s2">see why this would make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.660" end="00:16:00.730" style="s2">the palace was all about self-indulgence</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.730" end="00:16:03.140" style="s2">so surely the solution is self-denial I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:07.540" style="s2">mean that seems reasonable think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.140" end="00:16:12.200" style="s2">how often we do these swings between</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.540" end="00:16:15.770" style="s2">self-indulgence and self-denial so he</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.200" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">starves himself to the point where you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.770" end="00:16:21.980" style="s2">can see his spine from the front of his</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.419" end="00:19:37.070" style="s2">girl saves him which is I mean in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.509" end="00:19:39.799" style="s2">culture of the time that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.070" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">demeaning for a man who was once a</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.510" end="00:19:55.419" style="s2">it points to the radicalness of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.230" end="00:20:09.389" style="s2">fact so he realizes he must pursue the</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.389" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">optimizing his cognition that allows him</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.669" end="00:20:20.200" style="s2">to transcend and rediscover this missing</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.200" end="00:20:27.100" style="s2">the mendicant now this is important</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.649" end="00:20:31.269" style="s2">because this is the word for that kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.100" end="00:20:33.639" style="s2">of remembering sati it means to remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.269" end="00:20:36.639" style="s2">to remind not just like a fact it means</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.639" end="00:20:39.370" style="s2">to be it means to bring it to mind so</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.639" end="00:20:41.740" style="s2">this is um this is a modal memory this</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.370" end="00:20:43.750" style="s2">is remembering a lost mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.740" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">there&#39;s not remembering some a fact or</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.750" end="00:20:48.669" style="s2">event this was remembering what it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:52.440" style="s2">like to be in the being mode it is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.669" end="00:20:55.210" style="s2">recover a mode it is a deep kind of</p>

<p begin="00:20:55.210" end="00:21:02.710" style="s2">mean just simply remembering or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.919" end="00:21:05.769" style="s2">reminding yourself it&#39;s like when you go</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.710" end="00:21:09.940" style="s2">back to a place that you haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.769" end="00:21:11.980" style="s2">for a while and you start to recover and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:16.750" style="s2">remember an identity you used to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.980" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">there you go well you are away from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.750" end="00:21:21.399" style="s2">place you will remember the facts in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:23.860" style="s2">event but when you go there ah right</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.399" end="00:21:28.360" style="s2">this is what it was like to be me at</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.860" end="00:21:31.330" style="s2">this time it&#39;s that kind of remembering</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.360" end="00:21:32.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a modal memory right it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.330" end="00:21:37.389" style="s2">has to do with that participatory</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.860" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">knowing we were talking about Satara is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.389" end="00:21:46.950" style="s2">trying to remember the being mode it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:54.389" style="s2">this word up and go on about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.109" end="00:21:58.549" style="s2">because this is the word that is</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.549" end="00:22:10.109" style="s2">mindfulness but I bet you when I say</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.580" end="00:22:11.519" style="s2">mindfulness especially if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.109" end="00:22:15.239" style="s2">touch with this revolution that is</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.239" end="00:22:21.599" style="s2">think of remembering the being mode now</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.879" end="00:22:22.259" style="s2">there&#39;s some astute authors who describe</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.320" end="00:22:49.979" style="s2">transform them because he precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.289" end="00:22:53.190" style="s2">wants to remember he wants to recover</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.979" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a better word I would think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.190" end="00:23:01.409" style="s2">being mode not as an intellectual idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:23:03.509" style="s2">but as his very agency and the very way</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.409" end="00:23:06.239" style="s2">in which the world is realized in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.509" end="00:23:14.369" style="s2">conjunction and Co identification with</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.369" end="00:23:26.700" style="s2">what Siddhartha does in order to bring</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.549" end="00:23:28.709" style="s2">about this recovery but I&#39;m gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.700" end="00:23:31.979" style="s2">you one way of thinking about it that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.709" end="00:23:34.529" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna build towards another way in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.979" end="00:23:41.309" style="s2">which you remember in this sense of sati</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.529" end="00:23:43.829" style="s2">is when you wake up remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.309" end="00:23:45.839" style="s2">about this as one of the metaphors the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.829" end="00:23:47.759" style="s2">myths that people use for talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.839" end="00:23:49.739" style="s2">self transcendence there&#39;s enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.759" end="00:23:51.239" style="s2">there&#39;s waking up there&#39;s going from</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.030" end="00:25:00.330" style="s2">awakened one but we need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.590" end="00:25:03.480" style="s2">the cognitive science of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.330" end="00:25:05.190" style="s2">because we are here looking at siddharta</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.480" end="00:25:07.530" style="s2">precisely because of the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.190" end="00:25:11.130" style="s2">revolution that&#39;s happening here and now</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.530" end="00:25:14.190" style="s2">today and the mindfulness revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.130" end="00:25:16.950" style="s2">a response to the meaning crisis and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.190" end="00:25:20.750" style="s2">can see why it is even better if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.950" end="00:25:23.340" style="s2">reset it within Siddhartha&#39;s myth</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.750" end="00:25:25.050" style="s2">because we see that he&#39;s cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.340" end="00:25:27.870" style="s2">mindfulness to cultivate awakening</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.050" end="00:25:30.300" style="s2">because awakening is a way of responding</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.870" end="00:25:33.330" style="s2">to the meaning crisis hence the title of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.300" end="00:25:40.560" style="s2">this series awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.330" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">crisis but as a cognitive scientist I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.560" end="00:25:45.690" style="s2">critical and both are both appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:48.120" style="s2">of all of the scientific work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.690" end="00:25:50.250" style="s2">being done on mindfulness but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.120" end="00:25:54.030" style="s2">critical of it as a good scientist</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.250" end="00:25:56.610" style="s2">should be so I want to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.030" end="00:26:00.090" style="s2">about how we can understand and better</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.610" end="00:26:02.190" style="s2">formulate what it meet what mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.090" end="00:26:05.430" style="s2">means and this is based on work that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.190" end="00:26:08.180" style="s2">published in 2016 with Leo Ferraro on</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.430" end="00:26:08.180" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:16.110" style="s2">so again why am I doing this if we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.830" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">to awaken from the meaning crisis if we</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:21.540" style="s2">want to understand what sitar does</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:24.210" style="s2">awakening was we&#39;ve got to understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.540" end="00:26:27.060" style="s2">what mindfulness meant to him and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.210" end="00:26:29.370" style="s2">it meant to him is precisely the set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.060" end="00:26:31.320" style="s2">psycho technologies that brings about</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.370" end="00:26:33.750" style="s2">awakening and part of what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.320" end="00:26:36.690" style="s2">show is how can we get back to an</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.750" end="00:26:38.730" style="s2">understanding of mindfulness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.690" end="00:26:47.880" style="s2">constitutive psycho technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.730" end="00:26:49.680" style="s2">will afford precisely that how can we</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.880" end="00:26:52.470" style="s2">get a deeper understanding of the cause</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.680" end="00:26:55.250" style="s2">of the cognitive processes at work in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.470" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">mindfulness and how they can afford such</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.250" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">important existential transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:09.230" style="s2">if you ask people who are pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:11.940" style="s2">mindfulness practices meditation</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.230" end="00:27:13.350" style="s2">contemplative practices also try and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.940" end="00:27:15.720" style="s2">argue later why those shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.350" end="00:27:19.410" style="s2">treated as synonyms for example even</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.720" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">though they often are they&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.410" end="00:27:23.910" style="s2">sort of standard understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">mindfulness is and what I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.910" end="00:27:28.620" style="s2">first note is how much it is not picking</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:31.080" style="s2">up on what we&#39;ve already said about sati</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.620" end="00:27:33.540" style="s2">so people will tell you that to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.080" end="00:27:35.310" style="s2">mindful what you&#39;re trying to do is pay</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.540" end="00:27:38.760" style="s2">attention to the present moment in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.310" end="00:27:40.740" style="s2">non-judgmental fashion trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.760" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">how to notice there&#39;s that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.740" end="00:27:43.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a hint</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:45.810" style="s2">look there&#39;s this there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.680" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">this hint of the being mode remembering</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.810" end="00:27:49.020" style="s2">the being mode still there because I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.860" end="00:27:51.960" style="s2">say it&#39;s about being present there</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.020" end="00:27:54.900" style="s2">invoking right the being mode but</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.960" end="00:27:57.930" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it in a way that well</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.900" end="00:28:00.390" style="s2">helpful is maybe misleading</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.930" end="00:28:02.790" style="s2">now I want it I want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.390" end="00:28:05.010" style="s2">you&#39;re understanding what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.790" end="00:28:06.750" style="s2">criticizing what I&#39;m not criticizing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.010" end="00:28:10.160" style="s2">order to do that let me tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.750" end="00:28:12.500" style="s2">little bit more I both study mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.160" end="00:28:14.490" style="s2">scientifically and do work on it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.500" end="00:28:18.660" style="s2">experiments and published theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.490" end="00:28:22.290" style="s2">work on it I also teach I teach it as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.660" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">mentioned I teach meditative practices</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.290" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">contemplative practices and I teach</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.940" style="s2">extracurricular Tai Chi Chuan which is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:33.480" style="s2">form of moving mindfulness so I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.940" end="00:28:36.680" style="s2">familiar with both the academic attempt</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.480" end="00:28:44.490" style="s2">to explain mindfulness and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.680" end="00:28:46.560" style="s2">pedagogical attempt to teach it and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.490" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to have a foot in</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.560" end="00:28:51.630" style="s2">both of those worlds to realize a way in</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:55.380" style="s2">which you can become confused in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.630" end="00:28:57.900" style="s2">attempts to understand mindfulness we</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.380" end="00:28:59.940" style="s2">need to avoid confusion by making a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.900" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">distinction we avoid mortal confusion by</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.940" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">recovering the distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:06.870" style="s2">having mode and the being mode we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:08.790" style="s2">get deeply confused about mindfulness if</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.870" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">we do not remember the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.790" end="00:29:16.340" style="s2">between the language of training and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.340" style="s2">language of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.310" end="00:29:34.700" style="s2">this is the language I use when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">teaching people meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.700" end="00:29:42.110" style="s2">contemplation of Tai Chi I use language</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">that helps them acquire the skills in</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.110" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">this is language of imitation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:50.030" style="s2">involvement and I can depend on our</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:52.400" style="s2">presence together I can depend on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.030" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">pragmatics of the situation I can depend</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.400" end="00:29:57.860" style="s2">on the fact that their goal is that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">want to acquire the skill and so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.860" end="00:30:04.010" style="s2">use language there that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">for that but if I was simply to use that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.010" end="00:30:08.990" style="s2">language unquestioningly here I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.060" style="s2">make a mistake let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.990" end="00:30:13.880" style="s2">example and I&#39;m going to use an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.060" end="00:30:15.770" style="s2">from memory because of the connections</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.880" end="00:30:20.900" style="s2">I&#39;m making between mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.770" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">memory one of the most powerful ways you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.900" end="00:30:26.300" style="s2">can train your memory is to use what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:27.620" style="s2">known as the method of location or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.300" end="00:30:32.210" style="s2">method of Llosa if you want to sound</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.620" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">more pretentious okay so some of you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.210" end="00:30:36.680" style="s2">might have watched the Sherlock series</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">Sherlock does this with his mind palace</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.680" end="00:30:43.310" style="s2">right so what you do is you memorize the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:44.840" style="s2">space you memorize the rooms right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.310" end="00:30:47.480" style="s2">you can visualize them in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.840" end="00:30:48.740" style="s2">and that what if I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.480" end="00:30:50.060" style="s2">remember a bunch of things let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.740" end="00:30:51.950" style="s2">want to remember stuff associated with</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.060" end="00:30:54.440" style="s2">Socrates then I have a figure of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.950" end="00:30:56.510" style="s2">Socrates here and then I put a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.440" end="00:30:59.030" style="s2">other images there in that location and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.510" end="00:31:01.640" style="s2">then I now I want to remember some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.030" end="00:31:03.470" style="s2">about Plato and I have some other things</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.640" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">here some other images and I put a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.470" end="00:31:10.490" style="s2">of images sorted with Plato and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:13.010" style="s2">and then what I do in order to remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.490" end="00:31:14.600" style="s2">what I need to remember I call this up I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.010" end="00:31:15.650" style="s2">go into this room and I have all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.600" end="00:31:17.450" style="s2">images and they&#39;re all tightly</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.650" end="00:31:18.980" style="s2">associated together and I get all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.450" end="00:31:21.920" style="s2">information I need from Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.980" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">then I go and then I move in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.920" end="00:31:26.360" style="s2">Palace to where played it there the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:28.820" style="s2">Plato room is and I unfolded and this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.360" end="00:31:30.650" style="s2">powerful the orders that the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.820" end="00:31:33.470" style="s2">world could use the method of locations</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.650" end="00:31:36.590" style="s2">right - in order to memorize speeches</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.470" end="00:31:37.820" style="s2">that would last up to six hours and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.590" end="00:31:39.410" style="s2">know that this is a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.820" end="00:31:41.540" style="s2">mnemonic you should if you&#39;re a student</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.410" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">in your studying learn how to use this</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.540" end="00:31:45.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not just how to become a</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.170" end="00:31:50.540" style="s2">a superhero detective it is a good way</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.900" end="00:31:53.930" style="s2">to become a student the method of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.540" end="00:31:56.060" style="s2">locations now notice this it is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.930" end="00:31:59.990" style="s2">language of training it trains your</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.060" end="00:32:02.840" style="s2">memory well now what you may do and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.990" end="00:32:05.180" style="s2">would be a mistake is you may think this</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.840" end="00:32:07.670" style="s2">is how memory is organized this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.180" end="00:32:10.370" style="s2">called the spatial metaphor of memory</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.670" end="00:32:13.280" style="s2">you may think oh well this is how memory</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.370" end="00:32:16.010" style="s2">is organized all that all my memories</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.280" end="00:32:18.260" style="s2">for one thing on are sort of stable</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.010" end="00:32:20.990" style="s2">things like my image of Socrates during</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.260" end="00:32:23.450" style="s2">a stable location and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.990" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">that right right that are associated in</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.930" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">and everything&#39;s organized there and he</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:43.130" style="s2">it out and then he passes it up to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.000" end="00:32:45.080" style="s2">consciousness huh and that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.130" end="00:32:46.600" style="s2">remember right and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.080" end="00:32:52.580" style="s2">searching through our memory and</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.620" end="00:32:58.700" style="s2">out this a long time ago the spatial</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.660" end="00:33:04.030" style="s2">metaphor for memory is almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.700" end="00:33:04.030" style="s2">wrong your memory does not work this way</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.850" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work this way that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.540" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">so red is close to blue and shoe is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.960" end="00:33:42.050" style="s2">close to blue yes that means what else</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:46.700" style="s2">is close shoe and red so when I say shoe</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.050" end="00:33:49.090" style="s2">you should think of red do you of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.700" end="00:33:52.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.090" end="00:33:57.680" style="s2">here&#39;s another way in which your memory</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:56.179" style="s2">okay memory is a lot more mysterious and</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.259" end="00:37:45.640" style="s2">to have because do you remember what</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.230" end="00:38:43.930" style="s2">what does it mean it&#39;s somehow supposed</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.560" end="00:38:53.830" style="s2">on a continuum with awakening I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.630" end="00:38:58.570" style="s2">you what well explain what that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.830" end="00:39:02.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s supposed to reduce your</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.150" style="s2">insight obviously not just an</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.950" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">that by tying them to independently</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.900" end="00:40:23.630" style="s2">write independently constructed theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:26.570" style="s2">or theoretical claims within psychology</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.030" end="00:40:53.120" style="s2">operate so one of the things you do to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.300" end="00:40:54.770" style="s2">turn to turn a feature list into a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.120" end="00:40:56.090" style="s2">feature schema is you make some</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.770" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">distinctions between the types of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.090" end="00:40:59.330" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:03.530" style="s2">so here&#39;s of these core four that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.330" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">keep seeing a lot being present not</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.530" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">judging or non judging insight right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.720" end="00:41:21.470" style="s2">reduced reactivity I flip them up like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.140" end="00:41:24.440" style="s2">this because there&#39;s a distinction here</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.470" end="00:41:26.630" style="s2">these are states that I can get into</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.440" end="00:41:30.050" style="s2">right these are things I these are</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.630" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">things I can do so being present is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.050" end="00:41:35.660" style="s2">something I can do I can start it I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:37.850" style="s2">stop it we&#39;re gonna have to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.660" end="00:41:40.190" style="s2">what it means but we know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.850" end="00:41:41.810" style="s2">activity you&#39;re engaging in because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.190" end="00:41:43.640" style="s2">constantly being disrupted while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.810" end="00:41:46.490" style="s2">meditating and you&#39;re constantly having</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.640" end="00:41:48.740" style="s2">to engage in it and again and the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.490" end="00:41:51.320" style="s2">thing with not judging not judging is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.740" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">something you&#39;re doing it&#39;s a weird kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.320" end="00:41:56.990" style="s2">of paradoxical not doing but again you</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:42:03.410" style="s2">can start it it can stop you can restart</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.990" end="00:42:06.620" style="s2">it again but these these are not things</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.410" end="00:42:08.090" style="s2">you&#39;re doing these are results so to use</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.620" end="00:42:11.180" style="s2">the language of psychology these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.090" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">states you can get into but these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.180" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">traits that you cultivate you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:16.250" style="s2">become more insightful you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:22.310" style="s2">become less</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.250" end="00:42:25.700" style="s2">reactive so immediately we understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.310" end="00:42:27.080" style="s2">away so these are things I do and these</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.700" end="00:42:28.910" style="s2">are traits that I&#39;m supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.080" end="00:42:30.680" style="s2">realized when I&#39;m cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.910" end="00:42:34.790" style="s2">mindfulness now questions immediately</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.680" end="00:42:36.890" style="s2">emerge by making this distinction I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.790" end="00:42:39.170" style="s2">ask this question how does being present</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.890" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">cause insight or how does being present</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.170" end="00:42:45.970" style="s2">reduce reactivity why do does not</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:49.160" style="s2">judging cause insight does not judging</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.970" end="00:42:53.300" style="s2">cause reduce reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.160" end="00:42:55.130" style="s2">what&#39;s the causal relation notice that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.300" end="00:42:57.050" style="s2">the feature list doesn&#39;t talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.130" end="00:42:59.180" style="s2">at all it doesn&#39;t talk about how the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.050" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">features are causally related it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.180" end="00:43:09.370" style="s2">talk about how the states can cause the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:11.390" style="s2">traits but it also doesn&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.370" end="00:43:13.210" style="s2">constitutive questions constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.390" end="00:43:16.460" style="s2">questions are part whole relationships</p>

<p begin="00:43:18.260" end="00:43:23.120" style="s2">both part of some whole what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.470" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">what&#39;s the structural relationship here</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.120" end="00:43:27.260" style="s2">what about these is this part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:32.330" style="s2">this part of this are they both part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.260" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">some whole see the feature list does not</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">dass or not looking for the I&#39;d us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.940" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">not asking any of these questions these</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.990" style="s2">causal and constitutive questions now as</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:50.120" style="s2">we start to answer these questions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.990" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">as we start to answer them with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.120" end="00:43:54.980" style="s2">language of explaining rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">language of explaining we will turn a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.980" end="00:43:59.240" style="s2">feature list into a feature schema we</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:02.540" style="s2">will start to get at the structural</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.240" end="00:44:03.860" style="s2">functional organization of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.540" end="00:44:06.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ll start to get a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.860" end="00:44:09.320" style="s2">understanding of it and that will that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.320" end="00:44:10.940" style="s2">will help us to see how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.320" end="00:44:12.830" style="s2">mindfulness can bring about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:17.830" style="s2">radical transformations that were</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.830" end="00:44:17.830" style="s2">promised by Sid heart as realization</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.690" end="00:44:28.920" style="s2">all right so I&#39;m going to focus on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.230" end="00:44:28.920" style="s2">one right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.320" end="00:44:40.890" style="s2">and again we&#39;ll start by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.120" end="00:44:43.350" style="s2">specific insights but obviously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.890" end="00:44:44.670" style="s2">not talking about this insider that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.350" end="00:44:47.460" style="s2">insight we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.670" end="00:44:51.720" style="s2">fundamental existential modal kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.460" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">transformation okay I&#39;ve already said</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.720" end="00:44:58.260" style="s2">this language is useless people say okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:04.440" style="s2">well what I meant was something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.260" end="00:45:05.510" style="s2">concentration that&#39;s that that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.440" end="00:45:08.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.510" end="00:45:10.680" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not good enough because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.760" end="00:45:12.090" style="s2">you take a look at sitar does attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.680" end="00:45:13.800" style="s2">explain it he talks about right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.090" end="00:45:17.930" style="s2">concentration that&#39;s why I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.800" end="00:45:20.520" style="s2">concentration here right</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.930" end="00:45:22.350" style="s2">it&#39;s Satara is telling you that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.520" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">right concentration what does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.350" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">strongly mean that there is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:31.260" style="s2">concentration mindfulness isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:35.340" style="s2">concentration is about getting the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.260" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">kind of concentration what does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.340" end="00:45:47.580" style="s2">mean well all it means paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:52.470" style="s2">okay right again you&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.580" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">particular model for attention let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.470" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">talk about these two things a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:46:01.380" style="s2">and let&#39;s talk about right let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.410" end="00:46:03.870" style="s2">about what sit hearta and when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.380" end="00:46:06.530" style="s2">hearing not too tight not too loose for</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.640" end="00:46:16.320" style="s2">ways of concentrating this is based on</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.350" end="00:46:18.150" style="s2">work done by Ellen Langer who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.320" end="00:46:21.330" style="s2">probably the first book on mindfulness</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.960" end="00:48:40.799" style="s2">what kind of attention are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:42.670" style="s2">about and right we don&#39;t want too hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.799" end="00:48:44.019" style="s2">those are the strings too hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.670" end="00:48:47.289" style="s2">concentrate concentrate concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.019" end="00:48:51.309" style="s2">strings are too hard too tight oh just</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.180" end="00:49:05.950" style="s2">it&#39;s almost got this musicality of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.769" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">intelligibility to it well now you need</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.720" end="00:49:12.190" style="s2">attention because what I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.309" end="00:49:15.069" style="s2">you is attention isn&#39;t a spotlight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.190" end="00:49:18.369" style="s2">it&#39;s a very complex optimization process</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.069" end="00:49:20.259" style="s2">it&#39;s really about tuning and getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.369" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">between too tight and too loose and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.259" end="00:49:26.430" style="s2">allow you to becoming intimately</p>

<p begin="00:49:29.259" end="00:49:38.680" style="s2">paying attention to okay so why do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.859" end="00:49:40.329" style="s2">like the spotlight metaphor it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.680" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">insect and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll find it in</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.329" end="00:49:46.779" style="s2">psychology textbook attention is like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:48.609" style="s2">spotlight hahahaha well because one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.779" end="00:49:51.099" style="s2">the things that attention does is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.609" end="00:49:53.829" style="s2">captured very well by the spotlight</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.099" end="00:49:57.430" style="s2">metaphor look when I shine a light on</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.829" end="00:49:59.759" style="s2">something it makes that stand out it</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.430" end="00:50:01.690" style="s2">makes it stand out because it&#39;s brighter</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.759" end="00:50:03.670" style="s2">remember when things stand out that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.690" end="00:50:05.799" style="s2">salience it makes things more salient</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.670" end="00:50:08.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what attention does it makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.799" end="00:50:10.420" style="s2">things more salient attention is about</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.410" end="00:50:12.549" style="s2">right now we&#39;re getting something and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.420" end="00:50:15.220" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was doing here I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.549" end="00:50:21.519" style="s2">making things salient to you features of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.220" end="00:50:23.289" style="s2">my finger more salient to you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.519" end="00:50:24.789" style="s2">wrong with the spotlight well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.289" end="00:50:26.799" style="s2">wrong what&#39;s wrong with the spotlight</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.789" end="00:50:32.009" style="s2">metaphors well it picks up on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.799" end="00:50:35.710" style="s2">attention is about optimizing salience</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.009" end="00:50:39.009" style="s2">it&#39;s missing so much of what that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.710" end="00:50:42.329" style="s2">optimization actually is and how it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.009" end="00:50:42.329" style="s2">be connected to insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.150" end="00:50:47.569" style="s2">so some excellent work done by</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.740" end="00:50:49.039" style="s2">Christopher mall again very complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.569" end="00:50:52.579" style="s2">argument and I&#39;m not going to try and go</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.039" end="00:50:54.380" style="s2">through the whole thing but so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.579" end="00:50:57.619" style="s2">get into an understanding that attention</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.380" end="00:51:00.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t something you directly do let me</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.619" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">let me try and give you a comparison</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.680" end="00:51:13.849" style="s2">here walk and practice see walking is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:18.589" style="s2">something I can ask you to directly do I</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.849" end="00:51:22.359" style="s2">can say walk when you walk start walking</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.589" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">stop walking start walking again great</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.359" end="00:51:28.849" style="s2">but if I say to you practice God</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:32.740" style="s2">practice you should say to me practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.849" end="00:51:34.789" style="s2">what so you practice something by</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.740" end="00:51:37.640" style="s2">optimizing how you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.789" end="00:51:39.980" style="s2">else if I&#39;m practicing chess I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.640" end="00:51:43.009" style="s2">playing chess and doing some other thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.980" end="00:51:46.730" style="s2">practicing to practice chess is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.009" end="00:51:48.589" style="s2">optimize how I play chess to practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.730" end="00:51:52.999" style="s2">tennis is not to do tennis and some</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.589" end="00:51:54.619" style="s2">additional secret action practicing what</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.999" end="00:51:58.210" style="s2">I&#39;m doing when I&#39;m practicing tennis is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.619" end="00:51:58.210" style="s2">optimizing how I play tennis</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:05.809" style="s2">now Mol&#39;s point is you don&#39;t directly</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.450" end="00:52:07.369" style="s2">pay attention but it&#39;s not obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.809" end="00:52:09.140" style="s2">you that that&#39;s the case because of both</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.369" end="00:52:12.920" style="s2">the prevalence of the metaphor and have</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.140" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">skilled you are at paying attention but</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.920" end="00:52:19.940" style="s2">this is how you pay attention you pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:22.460" style="s2">attention by optimizing some other</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.940" end="00:52:24.589" style="s2">process that&#39;s why when I ask you to pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.460" end="00:52:26.269" style="s2">attention I can be asking you to do many</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.589" end="00:52:28.489" style="s2">different things I can ask you to pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.269" end="00:52:30.589" style="s2">attention and it means optimize your</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.489" end="00:52:33.589" style="s2">seeing so that it becomes looking and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.589" end="00:52:36.529" style="s2">watching I can ask you to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.589" end="00:52:39.650" style="s2">and it means optimize your hearing so</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.529" end="00:52:41.509" style="s2">that it becomes listening I can ask you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.650" end="00:52:44.450" style="s2">to pay attention and that means doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.509" end="00:52:47.170" style="s2">the two together optimizing your looking</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.450" end="00:52:49.609" style="s2">and your listening and so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.170" end="00:52:50.900" style="s2">coordinated well together but notice if</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.609" end="00:52:53.289" style="s2">I say to you I want you to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.900" end="00:52:55.400" style="s2">but I don&#39;t want you to do that by</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.289" end="00:52:56.579" style="s2">optimizing or improving anything else</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.400" end="00:52:58.109" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.579" end="00:53:00.239" style="s2">and I want you to pay attention by</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.109" end="00:53:01.799" style="s2">improving your looking or your listening</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.239" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">or your remembering I just want you to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.799" end="00:53:07.289" style="s2">directly pay attention come on do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.059" style="s2">right now pay attention you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.289" end="00:53:12.529" style="s2">what to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.059" end="00:53:16.380" style="s2">see you pay attention by optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.529" end="00:53:19.170" style="s2">other things you&#39;re doing now mole talks</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.380" end="00:53:20.549" style="s2">about this as cognitive unison what when</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.170" end="00:53:23.130" style="s2">we&#39;re optimizing what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.549" end="00:53:24.569" style="s2">is coordinate various processes so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.130" end="00:53:26.279" style="s2">they&#39;re sharing the same goal and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.569" end="00:53:27.689" style="s2">working well together think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.279" end="00:53:29.189" style="s2">Plato&#39;s idea about getting various</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.689" end="00:53:35.130" style="s2">different systems to work well together</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.189" end="00:53:37.829" style="s2">so what we need to understand is what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.130" end="00:53:40.309" style="s2">attention what&#39;s how is it optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.829" end="00:53:44.910" style="s2">how is it integrating things together</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.309" end="00:53:46.769" style="s2">how does that get improved in</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.910" end="00:53:48.959" style="s2">mindfulness practice and how does it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.769" end="00:53:51.209" style="s2">bring about insight not just an insight</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.959" end="00:53:54.689" style="s2">into this problem or this problem but</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.209" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">the insight the systemic insight that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.689" end="00:54:00.059" style="s2">awakening that motivates and empowers</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:02.519" style="s2">people to radically transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.059" end="00:54:05.039" style="s2">so that they can escape from modal</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.519" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2">confusion and other existential dilemmas</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.039" end="00:54:08.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll take a look at that next time</p>
