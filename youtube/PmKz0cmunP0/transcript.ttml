<p begin="00:00:04.160" end="00:00:08.320" style="s2">this is a film with aisha akanbi</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.640" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">who is a stylist and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.320" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">commentator probably best known for her</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">film</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">the problem with wokeness that went</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">viral a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">i think wokeness has robbed many a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:20.240" style="s2">people of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">compassion and replaced it with moral</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.240" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">superiority compassion and empathy</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">is paramount to any social movement and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">to any form of progress</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">once you have compassion and empathy you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:31.760" style="s2">can often see that</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">you have a lot more in common with</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.760" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">people than you do apart and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">system under which we live in</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">that forcefully tries to group us on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">what is radical is kindness what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">radical is understanding that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">thing they don&#39;t want us to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">understand each other arguing with each</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">other isn&#39;t actually radical at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">very conformist actually i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">wokeness does run the risk sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">in reducing very complex issues wokeness</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">tends to be quite reactionary instead of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">responsive</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">and so when you react you go off of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">motion and you go off of anger</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">resentment humiliation</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t necessarily leave much</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">space for nuance and nuance is important</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.879" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">in order to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">interconnectedness of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s fair to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">issues that she talked about in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">film</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">have become even more relevant in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">time since</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">so i caught up with her in london to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">talk about many things including how her</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">life has changed</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">since that film came out that was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">first thing i&#39;d ever done that went</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">viral and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">that was really scary actually um i</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">really didn&#39;t expect it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2">at all and maybe something i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:36.159" style="s2">fully appreciate at the time was</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.280" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">i think right now it&#39;s very rare to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.159" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">with my identity essentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">who is willing to say those things in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:46.640" style="s2">public um</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">i didn&#39;t actually know at the time that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.640" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">they were controversial</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">i just really thought this was common</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">sense and i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:55.600" style="s2">to many people which is why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">maddening that we&#39;re in this position</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.600" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">that we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">and the paradox of her talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">we needed to get beyond the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">but her words being taken more seriously</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">and having more resonance</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">because of her identity i&#39;m being honest</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m speaking from my heart</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">and i&#39;m glad that it resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">people but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">that it should only resonate with people</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">because i am black is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">um to swallow and digest because</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i just think we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">allowing ourselves to um</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">we&#39;re creating the ground to be easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">if we&#39;re only going to take someone at</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">their word because of their identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">um because yeah it&#39;s not actually that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">important to me if i&#39;m honest like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">being black being a woman my sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">these are probably the least interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">things about me</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">um and i do</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">think that we&#39;ll be in a good place when</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">they&#39;re the most the least interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">things about</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:58.879" style="s2">us all and how her criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.879" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">came from a really deep spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">transformation that she&#39;d gone through</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">although what i&#39;m doing can be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">political and i understand that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s very much not that as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">it&#39;s very much a a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">kind of journey that i&#39;m just sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">out loud with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">and i see the spiritual journey as</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">trying to um trying to get towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">truth you know and allowing oneself to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">be curious and i find a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">movements to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">anti-curious and that&#39;s very troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">for me because</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re not curious we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">understand things and as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">don&#39;t understand things</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">those things can control us for me what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">i find</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">so powerful about your that film and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">your work more generally is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">coming from a very empathetic place</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">i think there are lots of people now</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">saying controversial things or pushing</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">back on wokeness</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">but it often feels like it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">a quite a reactionary place</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a huge market for</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">that as well but what i love about your</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">the way you framed is that you framed it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">in a very empathetic way and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s like that the floor with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">wokeness as an ideology is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">a performative empathy but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">actually particularly empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">how do you how do you frame that how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">you how do you kind of keep that empathy</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">talking about these things well i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s always important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">your own sort of humble you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">beginnings in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">your own thoughts and ideas and i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">very much someone at one point who was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">quite susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">to some woke ideas what i think a large</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">section of the left i think they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">fixated on being socially aware that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">what it is to be workers to be socially</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">and what i really think it would really</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">is if the mission statement was to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">be as self-aware as it is socially aware</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">to prioritize um self-reflection</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t often think it does that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">because it positions itself as you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">being on the right side of history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">one of the good guys and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">when you consider yourself</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">that they are looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">form of awakening you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">problem with the word woke is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">finished it&#39;s not awakening it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">is maybe like a degree of um</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">a sort of like humanistic or spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">type of you know framework uh it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">i think it lacks a lot of humility</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">there&#39;s the paradox that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">saying that you&#39;d like identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">characteristics to be much less</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">but there is you are being listened to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">partly because of your identity</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">you&#39;re able to say certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">if i was to say for example they would</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">they would not be taken as seriously</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">because people would assume that i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">privilege or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">how do you kind of square that paradox</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat bittersweet um because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">very aware that a lot of what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">can only be said by someone who looks</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">like me and i wonder how long i can even</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">say it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">you know i mean i haven&#39;t uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">been no sort of campaign to cancel me</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">uh but i won&#39;t hold my breath on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">because you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">it it comes for everyone eventually</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">um but what i</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">what i say to a lot of people when they</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">um they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">uh responsive to the things i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re taking something positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">from it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">you know i let them know that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">there is no difference from me saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">and some you know a white man you know a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">white straight man like</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">i could have all types of intentions</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">that you know you wouldn&#39;t be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">you can&#39;t just subject you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">because i am black you know that that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">a um i don&#39;t know that sort of purifies</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">you know this message i mean i&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">honest and i&#39;m speaking from my heart</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m glad that it resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">people but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">that it should only resonate with people</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">because i am black is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">um to swallow and digest because</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i just think we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">allowing ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">um we&#39;re creating the ground to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">easily manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">if we&#39;re only going to take someone at</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">their word because of their identity</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">um because yeah it&#39;s not actually that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">important to me if i&#39;m honest like being</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">black</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">uh being a woman my sexuality these are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">probably the least interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">about me</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">um and i do think that we&#39;ll be in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">good place when they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">the least interesting things about us</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">all you know and that doesn&#39;t mean again</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">that i&#39;m saying that we should</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">um deny where we&#39;re from and deny that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">we have cultures that are different and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">and we can learn and borrow and and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">mix</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">uh from that place um</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">fundamental um</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that david i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">knowing that i can only say this because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">my identity but at the same time i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">it needs to be said</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">you know it very much needs to be said</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">um it needs to be said by i guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t easily read some sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">of ill intention from</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">um but yeah i don&#39;t know at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">time i</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">i would encourage people uh in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">to know that you know your identity is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">not synonymous with virtue</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">you know like anyone can be unintended</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">or well intended</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">watching some of the the interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">you before doing this i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">really struck by how much you&#39;ve gone on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">a personal spiritual journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">do you think that influences your</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">understanding of the sort of ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">yes completely you know i often think</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">a bad word because i&#39;m not a bad word</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s an unhelpful word because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">has so many connotations the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">um but i perceive the word spiritual to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">um an uncovering of yourself you know an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">uncovering of yourself and through that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">uncovering</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">uh the discovery or redefinition of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">those people that are around you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">and and that&#39;s the frame through which i</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">most things if not all things um so</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">although what i&#39;m doing can be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">political and i understand that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">um it&#39;s very much not that as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very much a um a spiritual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">journey that i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">sharing out loud with people um and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">see the spiritual journey as</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">trying to um trying to get towards truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">you know and allowing oneself to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">curious and i find a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">movements to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">anti-curious and that&#39;s very troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">for me because</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re not curious we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">understand things and as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">don&#39;t understand things</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">those things can control us because i</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">i do believe a lot of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">on a search</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">um what they may be searching for they</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">may not know</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">but it&#39;s a search and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">you know when i realized that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">that i was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really be found externally you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">know i tried to find a tribe i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">find a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">and i recognized there was too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">compromise</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">of principles sometimes values</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">things that are honest to you in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">to get this group membership</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">um you couldn&#39;t truly be yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">know and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">and it felt to me that part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">journey was about</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">truly getting to to know yourself um so</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">it just wasn&#39;t compatible but</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">you know i think when we have a more of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">a holistic understanding of ourselves i</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">do think it really shifts the way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">we see other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">you know i think is there&#39;s that saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t really see people</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">how they are we see them how we are um</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.760" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s within my interest and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">what i encourage</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:38.399" style="s2">for people to truly get to know</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">themselves in the most expansive way</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.399" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">because then we um extend that to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">i remember before this journey happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">it felt like a dark night of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">because before this um</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">kick started i remember being in bed and</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">sort of it was a journey that was full</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">of a lot of anguish and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">and full of a lot of pain but it was all</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">very necessary to go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">yeah and i really am grateful you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">if there&#39;s anything i call a privilege</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where i am but it feels</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s quite a solitary place still</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">yeah yeah i was struck i i&#39;m struck by</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">just how much parallels there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">your journey and the journey of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">journey and rebel wisdom and just this</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">i feel like we all have to kind of cross</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">this this this valley in some way i</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to define it but just in</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">the process of individuation and then we</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">spoke just before</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">recording and i mentioned i was familiar</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">with carl jung and you&#39;re like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">i&#39;m really familiar with carl jung but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">don&#39;t normally talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">um what what maps or what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">thinkers do you find</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">most useful to understand or to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">the journey that you&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">definitely uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">carl jung for sure um you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">what what jung says about</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">the shadow self you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">integration uh that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">in my world</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">and i think a lot of my work</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">is is trying to get people to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">more is to acknowledge it and to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s there first</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know if everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s there and and to not judge it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">you know because as long as we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">judging these uh undesirable aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">ourselves we&#39;re going to be defensive</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">about them and we&#39;re going to avoid them</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">but if we can learn to just see them</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">as is as opposed to this is bad</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">you know um that for me is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">um and also it&#39;s it&#39;s once you know your</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">shadow or you can see it you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">dialogue with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s much harder to be demeaning to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">you know for the same type of shadow um</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">so yeah i find carl jung to be uh very</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">i remember when i came across that and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">lot of might know it&#39;s quite a simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">book and it&#39;s very small</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">and loads of people like i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">understand this it makes no sense and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">was like this is the first thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">ever made sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">you know um so that was really</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">in in me coming across um and i would</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">say it&#39;s very much like a bible to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">it&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">often go back to um so yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">anyone who has like an element of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">within them somewhere even if they they</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">never use such words like</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">but some people have a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">energy i don&#39;t know you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">people that you&#39;ve even had on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">channel yeah i&#39;ve this is a channel</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">actually you know genuinely i don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">in very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">actually i&#39;m not just saying this</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">because i&#39;m on it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">um this is a channel that i have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">found deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">helpful because you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">the other side of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">conversation which doesn&#39;t get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">as he was saying something about jung</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">that struck me because i&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">conversation recently about</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">that awareness of the shadow and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">the necessity of kind of sitting with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">when we react to something out there</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and not immediately kind of going that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">but what is it bringing up in me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about curiosity as this</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">really important value</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">but that seems essential i mean for woke</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">in particular or at least sort of cancel</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">culture the sort of woke culture of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong we need to change it to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">able to realize well no actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">bringing up something in me that i need</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">to look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">seems like an essential piece and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just limit it to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">because we see that on the right just as</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">much as the left and we see cancel</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">culture on</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">on all sides of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">like there are certain taboo topics</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">wherever you come from</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">i would probably agree that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">more prevalent on the left because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">the head cultural hegemony at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">is more on the left and the right but</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">that awareness and that self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">seems so crucial and i think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">also really recognize in the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">perspective that you&#39;re bringing because</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">you you really understand that i feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">yes are i often think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">whatever is most aggravating to us and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">anything that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">elicits this sort of visceral response</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">or reaction that you can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">i think is an unchecked part of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">and so i know the moments when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">someone that i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">for no reason i sort of instinctively</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">dislike which is rare</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">but when that does happen i&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">your body&#39;s telling you something</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">oh here&#39;s something you haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">with um and so i&#39;m much more even when</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">uh wokeness you know it&#39;s a question i</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">have to ask myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">what is this bringing up you know why is</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">it that you don&#39;t like this or</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">what&#39;s so incompatible and of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">there are all of the um</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">legit concerns about you know i i see it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">as an anti-curious movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">i see it as selling self-sabotage under</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">the banner of empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">you know i i see it doing i see it as</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">aggravating</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">racial tension um all of that is true</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">however there might be this other</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">element that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">well you used to be like this a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">you know you used to be like this and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">and have you have you forgiven yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">you know and so what i see in</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">a lot of the council culture it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">me and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">this need and desperation to point out</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">who&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">you know and and make people accountable</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">this is something i hear people say a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">lot these days you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">he needs to be accountable um and i find</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">it very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">just even that thinking that it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">job to make other people accountable</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">it seems to me that people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">witnessing in other people who they used</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">you know and they&#39;re overcompensating</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">for that so when they see someone doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">something they don&#39;t like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">less about what that person is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">more about advertising well look at who</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">i am look at who i am no longer</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s more about i guess or even</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">sometimes disowned parts of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">exactly that um so yeah i see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">what it is i you know i i think i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">it down the other day somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">it feels like a war with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">yeah and i think that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">really i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way out</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">culture war dynamic that just seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">be accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">without that that acceptance or that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">dropping into a much deeper perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">that involves psychology that involves</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">uh mythology that involves the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">mythopoetic dimension</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">and certainly the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">dimension but i would argue like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">the personal growth or the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">dimension as well i don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">a way out from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">from just the sort of the surface level</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">yeah no i don&#39;t think so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">a lot of what people of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">there needs to be um</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">um aspects of political reform and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">governmental change and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">um you know systemic things happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">um however i often do see a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">are looking for externally is is first</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">going to come by</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">often can exacerbate them and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">when we are speaking about entire</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">just sort of completely erupt out if</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just um it just seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">the most corrosive way to try and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">understand one another um and even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">idea that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">be hyper aware now of other people&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">race and stuff like that whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">know it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">you know before that it wasn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">of an issue you know i could my my</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">friends who are not black could speak to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">me about anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">and i wouldn&#39;t feel the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">treading on eggshells whereas now i can</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">see the treading on eggshells i can see</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">people not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">offend me and maybe some might say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">you know people are just becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">thoughtful but</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we&#39;re becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">thoughtful i think we&#39;re becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">fearful</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s something about making</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">these categories primary</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">seems incredibly dangerous because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">brings you into kind of zero-sum game</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">like just acknowledging that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">primary way that we need to meet each</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">other i think is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">that feels incredibly regressive to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">but also there&#39;s an angle there which</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">coleman hughes was talking to john</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">mcwater recently and he said</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">what he found powerful about martin</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">luther king was that martin luther king</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">had this</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">kind of spiritual like he was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">christian pastor and he was able to sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">of say</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">we&#39;re all one in the eyes of god and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">had this possibility of holding up this</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">other value system that wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">uh identity politics and coleman asked</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">the question and i know you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">to him fairly soon so maybe i think this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">would be a really interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">talk to him about</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">is it possible and he he questioned</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">actually whether it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">to have a kind of or whether you needed</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">that kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">or spiritual perspective to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">kind of and i think you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">i think you do need some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">religious or transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">value to be able to unify beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s like we do need to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">of like there are racial disparities in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">some areas there are different</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">experiences of the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">kind of for me just basic empathy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">not it doesn&#39;t need to be formalized as</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">kind of intersectionality or this kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">of elaborate value system</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">but we have to have this sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">of what are we beyond</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">what are we beyond that our identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:07.039" style="s2">i think that feels like a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">important distinction like we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">aware of it we can&#39;t hold it as primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">yes you know you&#39;re completely right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">i think what the thing is is because a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have this um transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">for many people i think their identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">is the extent of who they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">so you know i meet lots of people now</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">who are more likely to say well</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">you know i&#39;m a feminist before human you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">know or i&#39;m a black</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">person before anything else um</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">and while i&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">anyone should have to negate you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">aspects of their identity but</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">we should be aware because we deserve to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">in our very one short life and the only</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">provable life that we know</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">um that we are so much more than this</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">you know and i often think the fixation</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">with your identity you know limits your</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">identity in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">um because whilst you&#39;re thinking let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">say well i&#39;m a man and i&#39;m from here so</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">that means i can&#39;t do this i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">listen to this i can&#39;t wear or</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">go here you know it&#39;s it&#39;s similar you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">know we often think that well</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">i&#39;m black and you know maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">white so you can&#39;t understand my</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t know anything about what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">been through we can&#39;t find a point of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s just not true um and i think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">um because whether it&#39;s discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">you may have experienced because of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">skin color maybe not but you could have</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">faced discriminations of other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">you know that can feel um just as</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">as powerful you know or just as hurtful</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">and we can relate there and even if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t i just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">i would like to assume uh that the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">pigmentation of your skin means that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">lack empathy and you lack compassion</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">because the other side of that is then</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">uh you know me having this identity</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">means that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">could lack this and like they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">saying it&#39;s true for one then</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">you know there has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">undesirable that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">on my side as well um so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">yeah it just for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">fundamentally uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">why i think a lot of racial discussions</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">that we&#39;re having in public now</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">feel again quite corrosive is that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">feels dishonest to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">our everyday interactions yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something just very profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">unhuman about the idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">impossible for me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">understand someone&#39;s experience like it</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">may be very difficult for me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">understand someone&#39;s experience but</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">by engaging in conversation by engaging</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">empathy by engaging in our human</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">capacities we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">empathize maybe i won&#39;t know fully what</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">it was like to live your life but i</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">but the idea that i cannot know possibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">there was a slogan during the recent</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">black lives matter uh protest which was</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">i i understand i will never understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">nevertheless i stand as a kind of ally</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">and on the face of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">it was like yeah solidarity but but</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">within that felt like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">i i was kind of very ambivalent about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">i understand i will never understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like that for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">is the death of empathy it&#39;s the death</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">art it&#39;s the death of so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">common human experience i think it just</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">it ends up siloing us off in a place</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">where we can never</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">get past like how how can we get if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">can&#39;t get past that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">we can&#39;t have a like we&#39;re dooming</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">ourselves to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">isolation from each other yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">exactly and there&#39;s this assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">you know every black person can</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">understand you know the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">another which is also not true</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">you know like that&#39;s and we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">not true and so i don&#39;t know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">we&#39;re saying things because you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">you know they&#39;re pithy and they sound</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">nice</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">and and so because they sound nice they</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">they should make sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">um but that&#39;s just yeah again</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s always what i just come</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">back to it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">not true there are plenty of black</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">people whose experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">i haven&#39;t had you know because it sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">works from this uh presumption that all</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">black people are experiencing the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">you know and that we all feel that our</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">lives have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">minimized and reduced because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">other people perceive us</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s not true no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">type of person you are you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">going to have people project things onto</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">you know you&#39;re always going to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">maybe people uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">perceive you as something you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we can get away from</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">this in the human experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">um but to say that all of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">projections that other people have had</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">especially the negative ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">have to color my entire experience and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">the entire way that i see myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s profoundly damaging to me i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s just not true yeah i want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">talk a little bit about because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">like so much of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">conversation is being influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">american conversation we seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">imported a lot of the categories</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">wholesale</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">and i think there are very different</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">dynamics there that are that are very</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">that are completely different like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">legacy of slavery and the legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">kind of redlining and long-term</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">are very different and i i guess you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">nigerian originally so you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">the same background in slavery i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">really interested in sort of those</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">i often don&#39;t feel like i see</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">enough of a meaningful difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">again i think you said it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.440" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">does seem like we import</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">the conversation wholesale and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">apply it to the uk and i&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">wise i mean it&#39;s not even that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">sure i don&#39;t think that&#39;s wise to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">because they are different there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">different legacies and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">and different present day um issues</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">um and i guess this is the uh the issue</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">with the internet i guess is that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">leave much space for for difference and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">nuance and complication</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">um but no i don&#39;t personally think i</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">see much of a difference you said you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">have no one&#39;s tried to cancel you yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">what are the criticisms that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m again i&#39;ve been fairly</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">lucky</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">and maybe the next time i come back and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">speak to you or be a completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">different story</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t actually get much</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">pushback and i don&#39;t actually get much</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">um at least i&#39;ve seen and i don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">looking through comments</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">but it is a very big privilege</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">onto the self when we do um</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">see this and it makes our navigation</p>

<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">and you can really have some truly</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">beautiful connections when you do open</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">happening at the moment because for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">certainly i feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">there&#39;s an amazing podcast recently with</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">they certainly had very different views</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">some were</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">kind of pro reparations some were not</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">but they were all</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">grappling with this sort of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">how much of the underachievement of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">black community in america for example</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">is to do with</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">structural racism how much is it to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">with ongoing discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">how much is it to do with historical</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">factors how much to do with cultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">factors</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">and it feels like for me the big problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">is that we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">we&#39;re in a world view that seems to only</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">the only acceptable explanation seems to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">be ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">discrimination right now and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">like a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">perspective because i feel like we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">to bring in all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">frames to be able to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">what are the what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">you feel are not being the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">are not being had</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">yeah i would say as far as racial</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">discourse goes</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">i i think we need to be able to give</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">equal weight to all of those things so</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">whether they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">cultural factors we can look at systemic</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">issues i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">is predominantly what we do right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t really give much space</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">to anything else something that i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">um is the self-esteem of uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">minority people so whether that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">whether this is someone who feels</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">marginalized by their sexuality someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">who feels marginalized by their race</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">um self-esteem i think um plays a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">big factor in how you see the world and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">how you see yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">irrespective of what barriers may exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">may or may not exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">um and so that is something that i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">is crucial and is something that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">i hope to encourage to raise</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">throughout my work because then</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s much easier to to live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">where you know because</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">we can&#39;t control other people people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">will always um</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">be fearful if they want to be fearful</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">discriminatory if they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">discriminatory</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">and so on and so forth but you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">change how you see yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">you can change how you deal with such</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">um and when we recognize for me when it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">comes to a lot of let&#39;s say actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">racist people which i i meet less and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">uh which is good but like you know i</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">racism to be a um</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">sort of like a reflection of one&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">ignorance um lack of understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">their own selves like inferiority</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">you know and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">threatening to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s something i pity you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s not something that can</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know necessarily outrage me in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">such a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">and i think we need to spend more time</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">philosophically maybe trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">understand and emotionally what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">racism you know underneath it all like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">actual racism</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">uh not just the way that we throw around</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">the way that we throw around the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">white supremacist or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">you know i think we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">think about how do people</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">you know harbour these views and and not</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">just white people because again you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">i think everybody can be racist or be</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">racially discriminatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s just semantics uh if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">want to use the term racism because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">don&#39;t think black people can be racist</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">racist whatever but we can still be</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">racially discriminatory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">prejudice um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">we need to be able to um</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">we need to be able to contend with</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">without necessarily saying that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.960" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">means their whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">entire character is utterly flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">you know we should put them in the bin</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be harder for</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">acknowledge that they have some biases</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">and maybe some negative racial</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">if we are also saying well this means</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">that you are a hideous you know morally</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">and pure person it&#39;s irredeemable</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">no one is going to want to self-reflect</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">under such an environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">um so for one i think we should stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">necessarily treating</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">racist attitudes as like the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">moral sin</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">if i&#39;m honest um because it&#39;s ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s foolish but it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">not something that makes you an</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">irredeemable person who should be cast</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">out of public life</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">i i think we need to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">each other more</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">um sorry this was a really long way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">doing this your question actually was</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">um what are we not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">um so in terms of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.839" style="s2">agree with a lot of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">that happened on brett weinstein&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.839" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">podcast i do think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">pay attention to the things outside of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2">discrimination because</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">in one&#39;s own life it&#39;s rare that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">that are making your life difficult are</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">solely about this external factor</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very very very rare you know even</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">if we think about a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">this romantic relationship breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">very rare that it&#39;s solely the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">person you know who&#39;s making this</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">relationship break down</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">you know even if they have the more</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">hostile aggressive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">the question will soon return why am i</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">still in this you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">and so i do think we um</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">yeah we need to be able to look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">reasons beyond discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">without without um without being</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">defensive you know without</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">suggesting that people who want to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">that conversation are ill-intended</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">anybody who really cares about</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">marginalized people black people and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">really wants to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">um the black race you know get to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">get to a point that is a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">progressive or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">um you are going to want to think about</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">it from all angles you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">you know otherwise you are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">shooting your own aims in the foot</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">so yeah i think we have to that is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">it means to care</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">is to look at all aspects and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">what i&#39;ve really loved just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">some of your podcasts and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">exchanged a few messages</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">is in rebel wisdom we&#39;ve got kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">few different frameworks that we talk</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">about and we&#39;ve talked about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">polyvagal theory and the value of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">curiosity we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">integral theory and the value of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">and you are you&#39;re talking about all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">all of the same stuff you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">he sent me a message saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">how valuable curiosity was and i was</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">like oh you&#39;ve heard of polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re like no it&#39;s like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">heard of integral theory no</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like so so refreshing um</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">that because i speak to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:42.000" style="s2">who are kind of saying a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">uh things but i&#39;ve often got a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.000" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">theoretical background in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">in this world or they&#39;re using a map</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">that they&#39;ve got from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">somewhere or other but you&#39;re you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">directly kind of made your way there</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">under your own steam</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">which in some ways kind of reassures me</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">that those maps are actually pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">something real because you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:02.800" style="s2">know about them to be able to see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">um but i&#39;m interested in asking you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">about that especially curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">because you said something beautiful in</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">one of the messages that it takes you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">the value of it is that it takes you</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">somewhere new or that it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">it by definition it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">individual journey i think or something</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">can you talk a bit about curiosity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">um curiosity is probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">um something i value um</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">higher than most things i think when</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">we&#39;re curious about each other for one</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">i i think it allows us to see this</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">commonality that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">um it makes us less</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">reactive and i think when you&#39;re i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">you&#39;re curious</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t think you have the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">rush to uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">to condemn i don&#39;t think you have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">same rush to criticize</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s the foundation of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">and and i really just think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just so crucial you know i i i</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s many sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">material things that i i value highly</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">but you know i&#39;m very hyper aware that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">very impermanent existence uh too hyper</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">and so it seems to me that the best way</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">to honor that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">uh that fact is to is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">be curious and is to um really get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">know ourselves while we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">um so yeah i don&#39;t know i mean it just</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">it seems to be the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">of everything uh of everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">transformative</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i think curiosity is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">something we can&#39;t afford to lose</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">and especially right now when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">living in this um attention</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">economy it&#39;s harder to be curious you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">have to fight for your curiosity now</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">because you know we&#39;re told what to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">believe and we&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">what we should be thinking about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">also something about vulnerability that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">that i think is really important like</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">that you you&#39;re prepared to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">kind of your doubts and your</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">your personal background as well in</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">public which i think is really important</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">as well and there seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">about that that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">again to get out of this situation that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">we&#39;re in like just showing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">all human just showing that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">these yes of course like you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">far from a yogi</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">you know and i i very much have my own</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">battles and struggles and issues with</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">self-doubt</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">um but you know i often think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">the mental sort of textures that we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.359" end="00:44:30.720" style="s2">that are not very delightful</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">you know i really think they&#39;re there to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.720" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">teach us something you know so even if</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">anxiety i think anxiety is often a clue</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">as to to that maybe you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">anxious around a certain someone or in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">certain space it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">tapping at you and saying like okay what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">is it about this place or this person</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">that you know is not okay with me you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">know it&#39;s asking you to do some work</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">and so yeah equally maybe even things</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">like depression like i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">if we&#39;re looking we can find um</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">use for these things doesn&#39;t mean i</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">think we have to we don&#39;t have to live</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">in these situations</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">but we can find use for them um and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">for me to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">to try and present someone that&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know not human i</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to do that very well um</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s something you said in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">um your talk about conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">conformist</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">which i think is really that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">thought especially now because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">being pushed towards polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">division by</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">the big tech platforms because that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">generates more interest the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">wired we are the more likely we are to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">keep kind of checking twitter</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">seeing if anyone&#39;s replied to our kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">of comment on facebook like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:44.079" style="s2">they are we are being pushed more and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">more towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">what we have tristan harris on our</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">podcast recently talked about the battle</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">to the bottom of the brain stem</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">like we&#39;re triggering for outrage we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">triggering for the more kind of primal</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">so i love that idea like conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">actually conformist it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">yeah i thought about doing putting on a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">t-shirt i know but i should do thank you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:06.079" style="s2">um but it is i do believe conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">conformist because it&#39;s knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.079" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">reactionary and it&#39;s just what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">always done</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve always had conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">each other but it&#39;s very rare that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">been able to understand each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">very rare that we can sit with something</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">deeply uncomfortable or deeply</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">disagreeable to our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">and rather than condemn someone for them</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">but ask</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.280" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">why do you have these ideas you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">takes uh that to me is a radical act</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to do we&#39;re not encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">to do it there&#39;s less applause for doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">you know someone might say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">humanizing the oppressor or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">like that or an abuser</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">um but if it&#39;s happening within humans</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">then it is human we know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">humanize it we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">you know humanizing it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">necessarily mean condoning such behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">it just means that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">you are prepared to explore it um</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">so uh sorry what was the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">conflict so um how did i get back into</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">and so these are the reasons as to why i</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">think conflict is conformist because</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s unthinking you just do it but to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">to be more understanding is a considered</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">you know response</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s practice it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">trying to overcome your compulsions how</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">do we do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">how do we do it david it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">we do it i think one of the principal</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">ways that we do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">is um by</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">recognizing and fully contending with</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">our own</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">capacity for destruction you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">really holding the the ugly</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">parts of what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">recognizing that they are in</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">us um and then maybe thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">what prevents us from maybe acting</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">within those ways you know maybe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">had a great family</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve had shelter support you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">education um and then recognizing where</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">those things may be missing for other</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know you just start to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">you just start to see people more</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">clearly yeah and and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">that is how we become more</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">more responsive and that&#39;s maybe how we</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">increase empathy</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">is by uh recognizing that maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">are no good people</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">there are only you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">people who are flawed trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">better that&#39;s it we&#39;re all at different</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">stages of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">yeah and i mean i have done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">as i&#39;ve talked about on the channel i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">done kind of a lot of kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">work personal growth work</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">group work and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">the energy that comes in when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">really honest with someone like</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of talking about your life</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">you&#39;re sharing kind of personal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">and you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">realize that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a space</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">that comes in there&#39;s a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">actual togetherness that kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">could criticize as being like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a very middle-class affectation</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">it&#39;s something that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s something that some people can</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">do but a lot of people can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">and i an experience not that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:19.760" style="s2">where i volunteered for a group called</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">band of brothers</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">and they match people up with mentors</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">they go through a kind of rite of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">passage</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">and i volunteered with them in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">hackney and it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">by far the most racially mixed group</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">not just racially mixed but also mixed</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">in terms of class there was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of kind of working-class</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">jamaican guys working-class kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">different africa caribbean communities</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">what was astonishing is that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">had the background of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">having gone through this rite of passage</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">talking about themselves talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">their struggles</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">their hopes their fears their weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">and it it was kind of it was magical</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">what happened like that was genuine</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">and i feel like a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">especially kind of guilty white liberal</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">kind of want to be like oh no we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">we&#39;re all together i&#39;m i&#39;m not racist</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a kind of efforting in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">that sort of sense of multiculturalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">where you&#39;re not really sharing these</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going to come in and out of their</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">communities you actually struggle to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">your events looking anything like other</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">than just your</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">kind of white community there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">if we&#39;re able to go into that space of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">with each other that everyone no matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">where you&#39;re from no matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">what your class background is you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">struggles in your life you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">difficulties you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">beliefs about yourself that you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">about something</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">magical happens when we&#39;re able to go</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">into a space we&#39;re actually able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">express that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">and that that for me seems to be just</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">such an important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">of the puzzle for like genuine humanity</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">genuine connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">and i feel like the problem is we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">an environment especially with social</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">media that militates against any of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">like we don&#39;t share anything personal we</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">don&#39;t feel we&#39;re in a safe space to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">that because we&#39;re not a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">it might be taken against us it might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">taken out of context all of these sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">of things but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">like that for me is the humanity somehow</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">needs to come back in i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know how we do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">but it just feels like that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">important yeah no i agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">i i think um honesty is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">thing that you know allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">transcend</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">all these shallow superficial</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">um and we&#39;re so yeah you&#39;re right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">not encouraged to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">we&#39;re encouraged to be right you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">lot of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">we&#39;re encouraged to you know have a take</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">make a point you know maybe safe spaces</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">at their most effective would be good</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">if they actually brought people who are</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">unlikely to talk together</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">you know so uh interracial</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">intergenerational you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">left and right you know and and and hash</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">out things</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">i think that&#39;s probably i mean because</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re insulating yourself</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">around other people who are just like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">you i mean that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">quite easily in life anyway without a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">safe space you know it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">the area that you&#39;ve grown up in in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">friendship groups</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">um but yeah i think safe spaces</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">um if there are to be any use for them i</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s in bringing</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.800" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">different types of people together um</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">because we do</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:43.359" style="s2">you know one of the issues i i think for</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">uh with this self-censorship that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">all going through right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">mental consequence to this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">mental consequence and an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">consequence</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">to having to swallow everything to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">being paranoid you know and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">that your friends are going to dislike</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t know maybe they find</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">out that you listen to jordan pearson</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">you know or whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">you know thinking that um you know all</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">paranoid thoughts that we have now you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">know we kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">maybe sensibly have to have um</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">i think there is a real consequence to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">that that is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">um useful or conducive</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">to the to the individual and to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">because we&#39;re sort of inviting everybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">to lie to us for</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">the sake of our own comfort you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">i would rather</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">know about the world that i live in you</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">parts of humanity we might be equipped</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.680" style="s2">to overcome some of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">did you listen to jordan peterson oh i</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">definitely did</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">you can make your life you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very very persuasive and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">very encouraging for people</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m cool with it yeah</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">feeling that you needed community or</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">looking for community do you still feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">that way or do you feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">finding more of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">i think i&#39;m finding more of it i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve accepted that i&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:27.760" style="s2">a solitary person um i think i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.760" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">i think it allows me to make sure i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">being honest with myself because i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">once i start feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">i want a political side or a home</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">beyond myself that&#39;s when i might start</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">you know not saying certain things</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:45.830" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know how these people</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">are going to take it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.830" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">so no i still don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">word is community</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">but i have a lot of loving um supportive</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">people in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">on the internet and and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">always saying the kindest things</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">considering we know we often think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">the internet and social media in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">is like a hell hole my experience there</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">is genuinely quite good</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">yeah people are really kind to me and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">and often very encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">and i meet people of all types of all</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">across the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">like you know i have genuine maga</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">followers</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">and you know i&#39;ve got some hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">marxists and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s nice to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">dialogue you know with both and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">just come in peace</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;s nice and are you concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">how you could be potentially used or how</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">your words could be used</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">because it does there is such a thing at</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">the moment of kind of um guilt by</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">association of appearing on certain</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">podcasts that you may be seeing as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">certain a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:54.319" style="s2">or do you do are you concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">that do you worry about</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.319" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">i mean like because i i personally i</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">think that what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.359" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">what you really offer as i&#39;ve said is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:03.599" style="s2">this sort of this real level of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">but there is a market for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.599" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">anti-woke stuff and there is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">temptation to be sort of maybe dragged a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">little bit further and further into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">more reactive</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">space and i&#39;ve seen that happen to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">people over the last</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">few years there are some there are some</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">shows that become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">just let&#39;s bash the left let&#39;s bash the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">left left is going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:25.839" style="s2">and for me that&#39;s just adding to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">division rather than trying to hold up a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.839" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">beyond it which is what i feel that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;re doing um</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.680" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">so i feel a little almost like a sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">is it protection protection almost a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">sense of protection is like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">yeah i would hate for that to happen i</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think would happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">but i am a little bit worried that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">might be sort of seen in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">if you are sort of seen as being aligned</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">with certain people</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">yes um i wish it wasn&#39;t something that i</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">had to consider but i do</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">consider it maybe not maybe not as</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">heavily as some people would like</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">because i feel if i&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:08.319" style="s2">hyper aware of who could use me</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">or who might misinterpret my message</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna say what i think and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">for me is is worse that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">that feels like a self-imposed prison um</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">so i don&#39;t want to do that but i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">i&#39;m very aware of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">you know i&#39;m under no illusion about</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.839" style="s2">why even you know i am in this in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.839" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">of certain conversations you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">aware that it&#39;s my identity i&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">that i am saying things that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">who don&#39;t look like me can&#39;t get away</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">with saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">um and so because i&#39;m very hyper aware</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">i it&#39;s quite easy to see and i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">don&#39;t blame them</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t blame them i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">them even necessarily being ill-intended</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.839" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">we&#39;re all sort of possessed at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">moment with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.119" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">cultural stuff and this uh need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">prove that we are right</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">um i think i can feel it i think i can</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:08.319" style="s2">spot it quite easily</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">um and yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.319" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">that sort of that tells me and directs</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">me where i should go and where i</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">um but the problem is or at least i i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">like there to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">enough scope on you know maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">mainstream left channels</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">um for discussion because</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the consequence you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">if you&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.400" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">accepting of different viewpoints then</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">the only people who are going to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">you know nuanced viewpoints or anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">like that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">people in the center or people on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">right people that you might</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">you know have some preconceived notion</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">so this is doubly why you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">to be able to open up conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">on all sides so you&#39;re not slowly</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">pushing people</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">um to one place but no in an ideal world</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:01.280" style="s2">i speak to everybody because you know i</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">i am genuinely interested in in everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.280" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">and especially people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">do not see the world in the way that i</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">do um</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">but yeah no i&#39;m i i think i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
