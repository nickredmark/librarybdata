<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.020" style="s2">so this video is about my disabilities</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.650" end="00:00:10.290" style="s2">my health challenges and how they</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.020" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">intersect the intersectionality of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:17.730" style="s2">disabilities I I feel that almost every</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">one of the traits that I have is rather</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.730" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">low on the spectrum of that trait I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">single-sided deafness but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:26.730" style="s2">tinnitus with it I don&#39;t have I still</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">have rather perfect hearing in my other</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">ear which is both a blessing and a curse</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">if your single sided deaf you can you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">can understand but there&#39;s the statistic</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">that I read was 30% of people become</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">single sided deaf in their adult life go</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:47.300" style="s2">on to not be able to work and I get that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">because it is very difficult to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.300" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">binary hearing world when you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">when you&#39;re single sighted because you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.250" style="s2">can&#39;t cancel it background noise and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">it&#39;s just exhausting to live in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.250" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">regular world so the world is exhausting</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">for me and I have chronic fatigue and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">what chronic fatigue is for some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s devastating they cannot get</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">out of bed they cannot do absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:11.900" style="s2">anything like a walk to the washroom is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">all they can do in a day</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.900" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">some can&#39;t even do that mine is less</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">than that as long as I don&#39;t do cardio</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">as long as my heart rate doesn&#39;t get up</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">I seem to do okay but my body doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">recover from which it was just a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">chronic fatigue that your body doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">restore itself with sleep so I restore</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">myself a little bit with sleep but</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">nowhere near what someone without</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">chronic fatigue does and yet not</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">anywhere near as bad as what somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">with very devastating chronic fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">has I have myalgia which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">chronic pain it&#39;s kind of unexplained</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">all throughout my body but there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">things that I can do that cause no pain</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:53.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t walk like I&#39;m in pain because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help to walk any differently</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.540" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">it&#39;s just different if I like hurt my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:00.299" style="s2">ankle or hurt my knee then I need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:02.630" style="s2">walk on it more softly I have arthritis</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.299" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">which is when you get in a pain cycle</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.630" end="00:02:07.220" style="s2">your body starts creating more pain so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hard to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.220" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">neurological mental part of fibromyalgia</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.439" style="s2">I also have arthritis but</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">figured it out and I&#39;m dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.439" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">I have sensory processing disorder which</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:22.829" style="s2">I have been diagnosed with which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.930" style="s2">subset of autism like it&#39;s bar under the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.829" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">autism umbrella but not when I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.930" end="00:02:30.599" style="s2">diagnosed with it so sounds can trigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">me some lights can trigger me smells can</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.599" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">trigger me and it puts me into fight</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">flight or freeze mode generally freeze</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">generally but sometimes fight or flight</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:45.269" style="s2">and like I need to get away from it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:46.799" style="s2">actually flight is is one so I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.269" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely missing more of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.799" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">diagnosis ease anxiety which is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">kind of a lot of people who end up</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">figuring out they have autism anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">their whole lives probably because you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">feel like you don&#39;t fit in and you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:00.810" style="s2">to figure out how to fit in so you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">some amount of social interaction cuz</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.810" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">you still I still how&#39;d that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">the single-sided deafness makes me tired</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.720" style="s2">the chronic fatigue means that I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">can&#39;t recuperate as well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.720" end="00:03:15.359" style="s2">fibromyalgia and arthritis students my</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">body&#39;s in pain which uses more energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.359" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">and so as long as I deal with my spoons</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:25.769" style="s2">which is a metric for energy then that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:28.949" style="s2">has has developed it in the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.769" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">disability community that as long as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.949" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">can budget my spoons I do okay but as</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:37.019" style="s2">soon as I&#39;ve had one bad day can it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:39.359" style="s2">lead into the next and lead into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.019" end="00:03:41.669" style="s2">next and it&#39;s really hard to recover</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.359" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">them so I have to make sure that I keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.669" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">myself warm so that I&#39;m not using extra</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">energy to do things like that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:51.569" style="s2">make sure and there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:54.510" style="s2">that are like it&#39;s finding the balance</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.569" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">if my house is clean my anxiety is doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.510" end="00:03:58.500" style="s2">better my everything is better right</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to move around takes less</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.500" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">energy to move around a clean house but</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">cleaning my house takes energy so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">almost always gonna get messy eventually</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:06.599" style="s2">because I&#39;m gonna have a bad day and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;m not gonna have students and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.599" end="00:04:12.629" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna end and I have a TD like and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:15.389" style="s2">I think so I do I have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.629" end="00:04:17.269" style="s2">keeping my house clean and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.389" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">opposite affects me I if I was to eat</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.269" end="00:04:22.830" style="s2">very healthy it would probably lessen a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">lot of my symptoms but I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.830" end="00:04:25.730" style="s2">energy to eat healthy or the executive</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:28.430" style="s2">functioning to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.730" end="00:04:30.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t and that was actually the one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.430" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">the biggest jumps in my health was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.620" end="00:04:37.850" style="s2">letting go of this rigid what is healthy</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:40.520" style="s2">and what&#39;s not now I&#39;ve got to go back</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.850" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">the other way and figure out how to how</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.520" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">to eat healthy within my capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:48.920" style="s2">spoons and executive functioning I feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">like I&#39;m gonna get off of this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.920" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">totally remember something that is oh my</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:57.920" style="s2">neurological stuff so since my radiation</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.130" end="00:05:01.430" style="s2">my brain is just weird like it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.920" end="00:05:03.050" style="s2">hold on to sensations for a really long</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.430" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">time like if I&#39;m nauseous</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.050" end="00:05:07.610" style="s2">it will continually be nauseous for</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">weeks or but then sometimes it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.610" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have a coffee now and when</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.220" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a coffee in the past it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">it becomes Tourette&#39;s like I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">Tourette&#39;s but it becomes like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">neurological pathway that it will just</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">keep following until it lets it go and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">also just have weird neurological</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:24.860" style="s2">sensations I&#39;ll smell things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:27.620" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.860" end="00:05:28.670" style="s2">or I will feel things on my body that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.620" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">know aren&#39;t there but since I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.670" end="00:05:30.920" style="s2">they&#39;re not there I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:32.390" style="s2">everyone smell like I&#39;ll feel something</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.920" end="00:05:34.310" style="s2">probably on me and I&#39;ll go to leg it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.390" end="00:05:35.630" style="s2">should or get it off it&#39;ll be like an</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.310" end="00:05:37.190" style="s2">actual thing and that will be you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.630" end="00:05:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;ll definitely freaked me out</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.190" end="00:05:42.530" style="s2">because I&#39;m so used to it not being</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.480" end="00:05:48.050" style="s2">something so I have a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">conditions I have changed the story from</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.050" end="00:05:52.520" style="s2">oh woe is me</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:55.340" style="s2">c&#39;mon why do I have all these things -</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.520" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">well one I don&#39;t have them all none of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.340" end="00:05:59.000" style="s2">them are terrible by themselves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:00.680" style="s2">only the intersectionality of them that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.000" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">makes it so I can&#39;t work it makes it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:06.260" style="s2">that my life is reduced and that they</p>
