<p begin="00:00:05.410" end="00:00:11.360" style="s2">Jonah Jordan really great to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.120" end="00:00:13.639" style="s2">connected with you remotely and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:17.630" style="s2">done films with each of you on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.639" end="00:00:19.160" style="s2">channel and where I know from talking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.630" end="00:00:21.500" style="s2">you individually that you were both very</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.160" end="00:00:22.820" style="s2">interested in each other&#39;s thought and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.500" end="00:00:24.830" style="s2">so this is the first time that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.820" end="00:00:27.499" style="s2">done something like this brought people</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.830" end="00:00:29.060" style="s2">together to explore kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.499" end="00:00:30.710" style="s2">independently I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.060" end="00:00:32.689" style="s2">be kind of almost redundant in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.710" end="00:00:34.879" style="s2">conversation but I&#39;m really excited to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.689" end="00:00:37.039" style="s2">see what you guys want to explore</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.879" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">together and I&#39;d love to start by just</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.039" end="00:00:42.320" style="s2">asking you what it is that you find</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:44.120" style="s2">interesting about each other&#39;s thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.320" end="00:00:46.039" style="s2">and that maybe will sort of give us</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.120" end="00:00:48.710" style="s2">something to spark off for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.039" end="00:00:51.320" style="s2">the conversation I&#39;m very interested and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.710" end="00:00:54.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a delightful conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.320" end="00:00:57.530" style="s2">Jordan last week I&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.980" end="00:01:00.140" style="s2">a couple of connections one that comes</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.530" end="00:01:02.059" style="s2">first to mind is I&#39;ve been exploring</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.140" end="00:01:04.610" style="s2">what I use this metaphor of the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.059" end="00:01:07.250" style="s2">the the cultural cognitive grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.610" end="00:01:11.480" style="s2">the West and how it&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.250" end="00:01:16.880" style="s2">projects of wisdom and meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.480" end="00:01:18.500" style="s2">and I see that Jordan seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.880" end="00:01:21.560" style="s2">talking in a way that&#39;s resonant with</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.500" end="00:01:24.500" style="s2">that he talks about a code and about</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.560" end="00:01:28.520" style="s2">trying to get beyond the code and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:32.360" style="s2">ascends towards this state that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.520" end="00:01:34.790" style="s2">refers to by the term coherence and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.360" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">very intrigued by that and how that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.790" end="00:01:39.590" style="s2">relates to some of the discussions I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:42.460" style="s2">had with others and some of the work I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.590" end="00:01:45.970" style="s2">do on self transcendence and insight and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.460" end="00:01:50.150" style="s2">I&#39;m also interested in how that process</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.970" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">and how coherence it&#39;s clear to me that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.150" end="00:01:54.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not identical to but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:57.110" style="s2">very I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.890" end="00:01:59.060" style="s2">again convergent with the work I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.110" end="00:02:00.740" style="s2">on relevance realization and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.060" end="00:02:05.320" style="s2">discussion about perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:07.250" style="s2">participatory knowing and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.320" end="00:02:09.649" style="s2">and I want this to be taken very</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.250" end="00:02:11.420" style="s2">seriously very seriously what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.649" end="00:02:13.880" style="s2">intriguing me about Jordan is he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.420" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">just talking about this I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.880" end="00:02:21.410" style="s2">see him you know exemplifying it and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:25.400" style="s2">way he interacts with each other and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.410" end="00:02:28.910" style="s2">find that also deeply thought-provoking</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.400" end="00:02:35.240" style="s2">and interesting yeah I was contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.910" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">the question and what came up sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.240" end="00:02:41.420" style="s2">I&#39;m in the mountains of BC right now and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:44.380" style="s2">apparently a bear just approached the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.420" end="00:02:46.490" style="s2">dogs decided that wasn&#39;t a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">what came up for me and it made me laugh</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.490" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">was the the feeling of it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:02:58.610" style="s2">John is is seeing or probably feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:03:01.160" style="s2">the same elephant since the blind men</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.610" end="00:03:03.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent a decent amount of the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:06.710" style="s2">couple of years becoming blind so that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.740" end="00:03:07.970" style="s2">am more able to reach out and I use a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.710" end="00:03:08.990" style="s2">different set of senses to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.970" end="00:03:12.590" style="s2">perceive what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.990" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">and those senses indicate to me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.590" end="00:03:21.080" style="s2">John is doing something that is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.450" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">real and the part of me that is still</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.080" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">very much operating in I see called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:29.090" style="s2">domain of semantic cognition is able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">connect the story that is telling with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.090" end="00:03:35.300" style="s2">things that I also understand to be true</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really nice combination there</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.300" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">between a way of holding the story as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:44.450" style="s2">weaving of a narrative that has the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2">characteristic of being what I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.450" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">call the semantically true or</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.620" end="00:03:50.270" style="s2">scientifically true mm-hm and also is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:56.770" style="s2">doing something at a more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.270" end="00:04:00.200" style="s2">level that has that almost haptic</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.770" end="00:04:03.070" style="s2">feeling of well we have the word for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.200" end="00:04:06.470" style="s2">feeling of insight so there we go and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.070" end="00:04:08.030" style="s2">also what I interject that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.470" end="00:04:10.160" style="s2">sense that we have as well on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.030" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">channel that I think we both talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.160" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">about before or we talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:16.430" style="s2">each of you before that there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:18.020" style="s2">of evolving conversation may I also have</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.430" end="00:04:20.630" style="s2">this sense that both of you are holding</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.020" end="00:04:25.150" style="s2">quite important pieces of that evolving</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.630" end="00:04:28.099" style="s2">conversation I think so too</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.150" end="00:04:29.539" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s and I keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.099" end="00:04:32.150" style="s2">saying this but it&#39;s because it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.539" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">impressing itself upon me one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.150" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">things that has been a great gift of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:41.599" style="s2">video series is precisely my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:43.190" style="s2">connecting with groups of people that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.599" end="00:04:48.849" style="s2">think are putting real real time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.190" end="00:04:52.819" style="s2">talent into trying to craft viable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.849" end="00:04:54.379" style="s2">you know long-standing wait like ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.819" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">that we&#39;ll have long-standing in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.379" end="00:05:00.440" style="s2">life responses to what I term the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">meaning crisis and trying to and trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.440" end="00:05:06.590" style="s2">to do the word sort of inadequate but</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to create something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.590" end="00:05:11.509" style="s2">the IC is simultaneously salvaging from</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:12.919" style="s2">the past but having some genuine novelty</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.509" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">and creativity and if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.919" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">in it that people are working towards in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">others and it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense there&#39;s a simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:22.699" style="s2">for me a sense of play and what people</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.379" style="s2">are doing because it and I mean that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.699" end="00:05:26.780" style="s2">serious play the way children really</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.379" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">play when they&#39;re really learning but</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">there&#39;s also it&#39;s mixed with a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:32.870" style="s2">urgency precisely because of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:35.169" style="s2">the situations we face in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.870" end="00:05:37.789" style="s2">so I used to be sort of more pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.169" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">about things but as I started meeting</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.789" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">people when people like Jordan for</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.330" style="s2">example and in communities it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:50.750" style="s2">shifting in my mind to a more hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.330" end="00:05:55.130" style="s2">stance so that&#39;s been a great a great</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:06:00.830" style="s2">gift for me would you say you&#39;re hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.130" end="00:06:05.479" style="s2">Jordan hmm I would say I&#39;m full of hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.830" end="00:06:09.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if anybody else noticed but</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.479" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">if you really reflect on the last bit of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.740" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">time when John was speaking there were a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">number of notes that came up that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:17.870" style="s2">very much to the center of the what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:19.789" style="s2">would call me being the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.870" end="00:06:20.810" style="s2">conversation I don&#39;t know for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.789" end="00:06:22.159" style="s2">there was a point where he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.810" end="00:06:25.340" style="s2">endeavoring to say something that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.159" end="00:06:27.400" style="s2">difficult and he even specifically spoke</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:30.590" style="s2">to the fact that the words were hard and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.400" end="00:06:33.139" style="s2">I actually was able to feel the energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.590" end="00:06:35.810" style="s2">of playfulness and the energy of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.139" end="00:06:36.979" style="s2">in the way he was bringing himself to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.810" end="00:06:38.449" style="s2">the thing he was trying to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.979" end="00:06:42.949" style="s2">think that&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.449" end="00:06:46.939" style="s2">the heart of the matter of the being</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.949" end="00:06:51.139" style="s2">there and the being out there feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.939" end="00:06:52.490" style="s2">really being fully exposed and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.139" end="00:06:54.559" style="s2">the metaphor we used in our last call</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.490" end="00:06:57.979" style="s2">was playing jazz but it&#39;s almost yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.559" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">yeah weaving jazz it&#39;s discovering jazz</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.979" end="00:07:03.469" style="s2">in this in a moment if also playing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.050" end="00:07:07.939" style="s2">and recognizing that you&#39;re playing jazz</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.469" end="00:07:10.129" style="s2">for all the marbles and so it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.939" end="00:07:12.050" style="s2">even than hope than it is I would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.129" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">courage and the courage that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.050" end="00:07:16.009" style="s2">actually noticing that as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:17.990" style="s2">standing there there are other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.009" end="00:07:20.120" style="s2">who are also standing there with courage</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.990" end="00:07:22.509" style="s2">maybe a better way of framing it playing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.120" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">jazz on the wall walking on a tightrope</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.509" end="00:07:28.099" style="s2">something like that Jordan had a well</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:32.330" style="s2">there&#39;s two things I want to say about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.099" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">that the first is it reminds me of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.330" end="00:07:37.580" style="s2">notion ancient Israelite notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:40.550" style="s2">off of sensing that you&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.580" end="00:07:43.279" style="s2">in a course and right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.550" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">involved in that and so and that was an</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.279" end="00:07:46.669" style="s2">older meaning of faith as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:48.589" style="s2">more modern meaning of sort of willful</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.669" end="00:07:51.469" style="s2">assertion without rational evidence or</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.589" end="00:07:53.899" style="s2">some such thing but the this older</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.469" end="00:07:56.449" style="s2">meaning was the sense of you know this</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.899" end="00:07:58.370" style="s2">participatory knowing of something right</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.449" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re deeply involved in but has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.370" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">greater life than you and it has some</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:04.370" style="s2">course and yet and you both sensing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.930" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">course but you&#39;re also being surprised</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.370" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">by it as it&#39;s unfolding and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">much become more more more salient to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:14.330" style="s2">and the other thing I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">relates to this because Jordan had this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.330" end="00:08:19.099" style="s2">wonderful metaphor last time that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">believe he got from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.099" end="00:08:24.229" style="s2">communication science about the way you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:26.749" style="s2">can sort of load lots of messages into</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.229" end="00:08:29.180" style="s2">one signal and I found that particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.749" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">perspicacious about trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.180" end="00:08:33.349" style="s2">this sense of sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">multi-dimensional kind of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.349" end="00:08:37.909" style="s2">communication that was going on and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">wondered Jordan if you could bring that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.909" end="00:08:43.729" style="s2">up again because I found that very sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:46.010" style="s2">of hopeful last time yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.729" end="00:08:49.640" style="s2">I guess suppose since we&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.010" end="00:08:52.310" style="s2">metaphor of tightrope AcroYoga</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:08:54.410" style="s2">I feel called to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.310" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">in real-time so the thing that came to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.410" end="00:08:57.829" style="s2">me as you were saying that was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:59.720" style="s2">phrase for those with ears to hear very</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.829" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">happiness there&#39;s a way of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.720" end="00:09:04.999" style="s2">pluck the string of communication that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">recognizes the way that all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.999" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">different modes of communication are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.370" end="00:09:17.029" style="s2">collected in a moment so just then for</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:18.649" style="s2">example that was clearly saying a set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.029" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">words that have a very simple semantic</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.649" end="00:09:24.559" style="s2">meaning but if you happen to have some</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:26.360" style="s2">connection to the history or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.559" end="00:09:29.300" style="s2">mythology that those words happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.360" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">associated with I&#39;m invoking a frame and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.300" end="00:09:34.819" style="s2">maybe even a disposition that allows a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:37.999" style="s2">way of communication that is deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.819" end="00:09:40.189" style="s2">richer that&#39;s just one example and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.999" end="00:09:42.139" style="s2">point is they do that in many many</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.189" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">different modes simultaneously so tone</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.139" end="00:09:47.240" style="s2">of voice</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:49.399" style="s2">and pace of speech and the jumping back</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.240" end="00:09:52.300" style="s2">and forth between different frames to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.399" end="00:09:55.029" style="s2">able to create a very high order</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.300" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">communications fabric through which</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.029" end="00:10:00.230" style="s2">larger and larger and deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:02.089" style="s2">and therefore at least in principle more</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.230" end="00:10:04.100" style="s2">meaningful communication and can happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.089" end="00:10:08.779" style="s2">in what is a stencil with the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.100" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">amount of objective time mm-hmm so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.779" end="00:10:13.759" style="s2">find that very interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:15.970" style="s2">find this idea of if you&#39;ll allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.759" end="00:10:18.439" style="s2">metaphor right if we think of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.970" end="00:10:20.209" style="s2">typical models of communication like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.439" end="00:10:21.769" style="s2">channel and sort of horizontal between</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.209" end="00:10:23.990" style="s2">us you&#39;re talking about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.769" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">more vertical aspect right we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.990" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2">to bring in all these layers if I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.670" end="00:10:32.329" style="s2">use that metaphor and you know and for</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:34.850" style="s2">me that bespeaks something that I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.329" end="00:10:36.769" style="s2">is very very important because when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.850" end="00:10:38.870" style="s2">talk about meaning and meaning in life I</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.769" end="00:10:40.519" style="s2">repeatedly acknowledge this is a city</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">where I&#39;m using a semantic metaphor to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.519" end="00:10:44.059" style="s2">try and convey something like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">ultimately there are deeper than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.059" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">semantic communication I talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:50.360" style="s2">respectable knowing and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.829" style="s2">participatory knowing and it&#39;s so one</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.360" end="00:10:55.189" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been trying to think about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.829" end="00:10:57.769" style="s2">we talked about last time is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.189" end="00:10:59.389" style="s2">trying to bring right a kind of sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.769" end="00:11:00.559" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want misuse your</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.389" end="00:11:02.569" style="s2">word here but the word for the game to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.559" end="00:11:04.370" style="s2">my mind was a kind of coherence a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.569" end="00:11:07.130" style="s2">vertical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.370" end="00:11:10.850" style="s2">between these different modes of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.130" end="00:11:13.190" style="s2">these different levels so that rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.850" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">than than being orthogonal or disjointed</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.190" end="00:11:16.820" style="s2">or disconnected they are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:18.440" style="s2">informing and transforming each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.820" end="00:11:22.010" style="s2">and then that&#39;s what&#39;s being conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:24.500" style="s2">not to the other person I apologize I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.010" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">just noticed that it&#39;s cold in Canada I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.500" end="00:11:28.100" style="s2">need to go inside one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:30.740" style="s2">time of the series is the different ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.100" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">in which people read text for example as</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.740" end="00:11:33.589" style="s2">an example just try to start deepening</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:35.960" style="s2">the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.589" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">so I compare how we read texts we read</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.960" end="00:11:39.890" style="s2">we tend to read text right in a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:41.210" style="s2">Tori fashion we&#39;re taking in two</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.890" end="00:11:43.250" style="s2">propositions we&#39;re looking for the in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.210" end="00:11:45.230" style="s2">sort of the logical coherence between</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.250" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">the propositions in our head and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.230" end="00:11:49.910" style="s2">sort of living inside of our head in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:52.190" style="s2">that way and then before that typified</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.910" end="00:11:54.740" style="s2">you know people doing lectio divina</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.190" end="00:11:56.960" style="s2">right was this this were reading that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.740" end="00:11:59.390" style="s2">was recitation it was done communally</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.960" end="00:12:01.490" style="s2">and right and it&#39;s meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.390" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">participatory they like the way you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.490" end="00:12:06.470" style="s2">a poem or the way you you sort of set</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:08.390" style="s2">yourself to appreciate music and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">then the whole point of that was not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.390" end="00:12:14.300" style="s2">just to take in the information and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.200" end="00:12:16.910" style="s2">consume it but the idea was that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.300" end="00:12:19.520" style="s2">could actually only approach the reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.910" end="00:12:21.800" style="s2">that the words were referring to if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.520" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">were allowed something other than just</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.800" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">the semantic content to engage you a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:30.440" style="s2">transformative process right so it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:32.150" style="s2">very much this idea that you can&#39;t these</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.440" end="00:12:34.130" style="s2">deeper realities require a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.150" end="00:12:37.130" style="s2">transformation before we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.130" end="00:12:38.660" style="s2">appropriately grasp you know the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.130" end="00:12:42.980" style="s2">of the words that are being uttered and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.660" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">so the the the and so crayons and others</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:46.610" style="s2">talk about you know the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:48.589" style="s2">self was a much more extensive notion it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.610" end="00:12:50.630" style="s2">was involved with others and with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.589" end="00:12:53.029" style="s2">text rather than being sort of locked</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.630" end="00:12:55.459" style="s2">inside the head and locked inside the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.029" end="00:12:57.290" style="s2">propositions now why all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.459" end="00:13:00.440" style="s2">relevant to me and I think to our</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.290" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">conversation is because right one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.440" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">core aspects of what people reliably</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">seem to be pointing towards when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:10.550" style="s2">seeking meaning is this sense of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">connectedness connectedness to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.550" end="00:13:15.589" style="s2">themselves to each other and to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:18.110" style="s2">reality that in some sense is is greater</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.589" end="00:13:20.930" style="s2">than them and it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.110" end="00:13:21.800" style="s2">I think this is what it seems to me I</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.930" end="00:13:24.649" style="s2">think you&#39;re doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.800" end="00:13:26.390" style="s2">analogous with spoken discourse as what</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.649" end="00:13:28.430" style="s2">people were trying were doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.390" end="00:13:31.010" style="s2">reading which was also being spoken by</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.430" end="00:13:33.310" style="s2">the way what I mean by that is you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.170" end="00:14:05.200" style="s2">right where we&#39;re mutually transforming</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.180" end="00:14:26.709" style="s2">was a a no we were doing the thing what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:28.850" style="s2">one thing that was coming up almost like</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.709" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">what is it the angel in the shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.850" end="00:14:34.850" style="s2">during is the the feeling I remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:38.029" style="s2">when I was younger I I noticed that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.850" end="00:14:39.260" style="s2">had a really hard time with music II and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.029" end="00:14:40.940" style="s2">I was wondering why that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.260" end="00:14:44.060" style="s2">case and then I realized that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.940" end="00:14:48.820" style="s2">because most music that we encounter in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.060" end="00:14:48.820" style="s2">our lives these days is irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.630" end="00:14:56.390" style="s2">music has a very strong capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.019" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">modify the emotions and in fact to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.390" end="00:14:59.630" style="s2">modify the body and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.100" end="00:15:02.029" style="s2">listening to music you cannot help but</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.630" end="00:15:07.459" style="s2">have some meaningful change in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.029" end="00:15:10.430" style="s2">physical state and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.459" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">powerful thing and needs to be held with</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:14.120" style="s2">a very high degree of ethics I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:18.949" style="s2">even say to be at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.120" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">sacred and I was feeling that because as</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.949" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">you were talking about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">connectedness and the notion of to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:31.579" style="s2">transformed in the act of communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:32.779" style="s2">yes there is there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.579" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">that happens in any form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.779" end="00:15:36.499" style="s2">communication that has the ability at</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.670" end="00:15:40.600" style="s2">least in principle to take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.499" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">this wholeness of possibility and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.600" end="00:15:45.290" style="s2">participate in that wholeness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:48.439" style="s2">possibility to to be speaking in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.290" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">that is simultaneously poetry and prose</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.439" end="00:15:56.180" style="s2">and music and dance and allow all those</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:59.779" style="s2">different modalities of expression to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.180" end="00:16:02.449" style="s2">convey something that is I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.779" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">deeper and as you say this starts to</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.449" end="00:16:05.149" style="s2">move much more in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:08.620" style="s2">meaningfulness like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.149" end="00:16:10.670" style="s2">connecting meaningfulness and wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">in fact know that I&#39;m thinking about you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.670" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">spoke to the fact that I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:21.259" style="s2">episode 18 or 17 of the Platonists and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">then later Augustinian weaving together</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.259" end="00:16:25.699" style="s2">of three distinct threads yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:28.670" style="s2">think that&#39;s very much to the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.699" end="00:16:30.589" style="s2">there&#39;s a when we are interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.670" end="00:16:33.110" style="s2">each other to be able to heal each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.589" end="00:16:34.939" style="s2">in the moment and to be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.110" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">each other more fully present to what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.939" end="00:16:38.149" style="s2">happening in the moment and then to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">able to do something that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.149" end="00:16:42.679" style="s2">something that is greater than the sum</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:44.929" style="s2">of its parts to have a thing in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.679" end="00:16:46.429" style="s2">and I your invocation both Augustine</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.929" end="00:16:48.559" style="s2">Platonists I think is very apropos</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.429" end="00:16:50.809" style="s2">because I mean that&#39;s the idea dust goes</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.559" end="00:16:52.879" style="s2">back to the core platonic insight right</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.809" end="00:16:55.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s for me one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.879" end="00:16:57.379" style="s2">crucial decisions we made in the West we</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.160" end="00:16:59.269" style="s2">stopped the platonic dialogue and went</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.379" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">into the Aristotelian treatise right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.269" end="00:17:03.620" style="s2">the platonic dialogue I mean at times</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.029" style="s2">they&#39;re very ham-fisted I get that but</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.620" end="00:17:06.949" style="s2">there are also moments where you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.029" end="00:17:09.799" style="s2">where you can see Plato trying to catch</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.949" end="00:17:11.299" style="s2">what was happening right in this ER and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.799" end="00:17:12.890" style="s2">the Socratic length goes in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.299" end="00:17:15.020" style="s2">dialogue like what you just said that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.890" end="00:17:18.949" style="s2">the two of us together can co-create</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.020" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">something that transcends both of us but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.949" end="00:17:22.490" style="s2">I wanted to and I wanted to pick up on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">platonic metaphor that you also</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.490" end="00:17:25.819" style="s2">mentioned and I didn&#39;t want to lose what</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.770" style="s2">we were talking about because it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.819" end="00:17:28.909" style="s2">only the idea that you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.770" end="00:17:31.100" style="s2">are engaging in this mutual</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.909" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">transformation it&#39;s the idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.100" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">transformation is required for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:39.380" style="s2">enter into right a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:41.870" style="s2">aspects and dimensions of reality see</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.380" end="00:17:42.530" style="s2">when when we when we did the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.870" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">Devore</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.530" end="00:17:46.850" style="s2">that you know I don&#39;t have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">transformation in order to get access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.850" end="00:17:51.410" style="s2">deeper aspects of reality I just think</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:55.510" style="s2">clearly about it I think that was also</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.410" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve lost the so I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.510" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to articulate now it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s resonant with what</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:03.650" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to articulate it is no no</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:06.190" style="s2">no right not only do do we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.650" end="00:18:08.690" style="s2">into a particular mode of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.190" end="00:18:11.900" style="s2">transformational you know connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.690" end="00:18:13.580" style="s2">in order to you know reach each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.900" end="00:18:16.250" style="s2">and resonate with each other there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.580" end="00:18:19.070" style="s2">aspects of reality that are also only</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.250" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">accessible if we are willing to you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.070" end="00:18:24.410" style="s2">undergo transformation in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:26.120" style="s2">connect to them as well and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.410" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">think that needs to be kept in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.120" end="00:18:32.270" style="s2">conversation as well if there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:34.780" style="s2">have like a laser strobe lights just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.270" end="00:18:39.400" style="s2">few seconds ago I would push that button</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.780" end="00:18:39.400" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to convey how</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.290" end="00:18:46.180" style="s2">how powerful it is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.570" end="00:18:51.640" style="s2">perceive the meaningfulness of what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.180" end="00:19:08.380" style="s2">just pointed to mmm trying its words are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.640" end="00:19:13.330" style="s2">very very not capable woodsy oh god it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.380" end="00:19:15.970" style="s2">incredible so maybe is a very terrible</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.330" end="00:19:19.060" style="s2">metaphor you can begin by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.970" end="00:19:22.150" style="s2">the capacity to achieve a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.060" end="00:19:27.090" style="s2">of coherence using continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.150" end="00:19:29.290" style="s2">communication through propositions as</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.090" end="00:19:32.050" style="s2">having a flatness to it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:33.550" style="s2">two-dimensional thing mm-hmm well it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.050" end="00:19:35.590" style="s2">ain&#39;t nothing and we can make a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.550" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">big piece of paper and it can go on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.590" end="00:19:40.360" style="s2">can be infinite in all directions but</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">it&#39;s two-dimensional and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.360" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">another move that has this deepening</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:47.890" style="s2">which adds a third dimension which for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:50.560" style="s2">second I kind of felt like was the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.890" end="00:19:54.370" style="s2">but then I realized that as I really</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.560" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">felt this proposition mm-hmm this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.370" end="00:20:05.410" style="s2">invitation to take transformation itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:07.930" style="s2">as being so there it is got it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.410" end="00:20:09.820" style="s2">the whole point got it neat it is in</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.930" end="00:20:12.670" style="s2">through it is through being transformed</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.820" end="00:20:17.190" style="s2">that we are no longer merely perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.670" end="00:20:20.710" style="s2">reality but are actually one with it mmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.190" end="00:20:23.020" style="s2">this is the key to the whole move if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.710" end="00:20:25.510" style="s2">think about there being a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.020" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">distinction between assertive analytic</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.510" style="s2">and over again over the last two</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.660" end="00:20:55.190" style="s2">to the degree to which you are by</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.450" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">mm-hmm but if you actually proceed by a</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.170" end="00:21:24.680" style="s2">very different way of knowing it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.150" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">of knowing that has the capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.080" end="00:21:38.570" style="s2">I would say that I often try to point</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:40.070" style="s2">towards that kind of knowing when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.570" end="00:21:43.790" style="s2">about the participatory knowing they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">that deep sense of oneness I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to articulate right it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.170" end="00:22:26.090" style="s2">that&#39;s part of how I&#39;m knowing myself</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.410" end="00:22:28.370" style="s2">differently right here right now and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.090" end="00:22:31.400" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s giving me an insight</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.400" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">right you are here right now and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.970" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">what that&#39;s what I typically try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">point to when I point to participatory</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:43.930" style="s2">knowing and and the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:46.040" style="s2">pushed I mean this is not an idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.930" end="00:22:48.140" style="s2">original to me by any means I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.040" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">think a lot of important people Marla</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.140" end="00:22:53.990" style="s2">Ponte and others were trying to remind</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.820" style="s2">us how foundational this kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.990" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">is and that all the other knowings</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.820" end="00:23:00.200" style="s2">depend on it but we have tended for</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:02.630" style="s2">various historical and cultural reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.200" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">to neglect it and seriously background</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:08.490" style="s2">and and and I want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:09.900" style="s2">morning and and this isn&#39;t this is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.490" end="00:23:12.540" style="s2">too many TV flattery it&#39;s meant to be a</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.540" end="00:23:15.570" style="s2">important to you and this is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.190" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">when I say to people don&#39;t tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.570" end="00:23:19.560" style="s2">you believe tell me what you practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.570" style="s2">right you you have to practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.560" end="00:23:23.190" style="s2">participatory and that&#39;s what I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.570" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see you doing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:27.660" style="s2">what I see you constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">articulate with people it&#39;s like no no</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.660" end="00:23:31.800" style="s2">we can&#39;t just talk about this you ha</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:33.270" style="s2">like it&#39;s like it&#39;s like an</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.270" end="00:23:37.350" style="s2">to go and do participant observation in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.400" end="00:23:39.480" style="s2">the culture or you&#39;ll never get the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.350" end="00:23:41.370" style="s2">culture you&#39;ll never get it you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.480" end="00:23:42.630" style="s2">about it you can reflect on it but you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.370" end="00:23:44.670" style="s2">got to go there you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.630" end="00:23:46.560" style="s2">transformed by the culture and know</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.670" end="00:23:48.630" style="s2">yourself differently and that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.560" end="00:23:51.090" style="s2">come to know the culture and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.630" end="00:23:54.060" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s so important that right that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.090" end="00:23:56.220" style="s2">there is this I don&#39;t want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.060" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">sound like you&#39;re you&#39;re stubborn</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.220" end="00:23:59.130" style="s2">because that&#39;s not what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:00.900" style="s2">convey that that would be to mislead</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.130" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say is there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.900" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">there is this way in which you keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:09.090" style="s2">gently trying to being people back right</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:10.800" style="s2">to this communication is something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.090" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">has to be practiced right it is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.800" end="00:24:15.660" style="s2">practice it is it is not just a set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:20.160" style="s2">statements or a claim or a theory and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.660" end="00:24:23.400" style="s2">and I and I find that so so central and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.160" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">important it&#39;s easy to say but it giving</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.400" end="00:24:31.680" style="s2">it the priority is just really really</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:36.390" style="s2">important yeah I think maybe now might</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.680" end="00:24:41.880" style="s2">be a window or an opening to maybe why</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.390" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">he why that would be the case and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.880" end="00:24:49.050" style="s2">your in your series you you refer to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:51.210" style="s2">meaning crisis and I imagine given who</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.050" end="00:24:55.290" style="s2">you are and not using the word crisis</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.210" end="00:24:57.990" style="s2">lately no yeah you&#39;re not saying the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.290" end="00:24:59.310" style="s2">sort of somewhat disturbing meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.990" end="00:25:04.770" style="s2">thing no no you&#39;re saying the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.310" end="00:25:07.530" style="s2">crisis yes and I I think of course feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.770" end="00:25:10.290" style="s2">very much the same thing so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.530" end="00:25:14.760" style="s2">say is that in my particular journey to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.290" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">come here which gives rise to what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.760" end="00:25:17.909" style="s2">would say is the commitment that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:23.090" style="s2">that you&#39;re perceiving in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.909" end="00:25:23.090" style="s2">stubbornness that&#39;s the word I want I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.720" end="00:25:29.129" style="s2">endeavored to explore every possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.129" end="00:25:31.379" style="s2">route that was not at this route to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.129" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">address that crisis mm-hmm I perceived</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.379" end="00:25:38.669" style="s2">the crisis too clearly every time that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">looked at any aspect of life and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.669" end="00:25:43.740" style="s2">very much in the objective domain and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:45.779" style="s2">whether I looked at financial markets or</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.740" end="00:25:50.730" style="s2">I looked at nuclear proliferation or I</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.779" end="00:25:52.309" style="s2">looked at concentration of hormones in</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.730" end="00:25:55.889" style="s2">the water supply or fill in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.309" end="00:25:57.769" style="s2">what I noticed was that the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.889" end="00:26:00.299" style="s2">that we are participating in the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.769" end="00:26:04.049" style="s2">civilization the mode of doing that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.299" end="00:26:05.759" style="s2">actively engage in together seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.049" end="00:26:10.409" style="s2">accelerating towards some point of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.759" end="00:26:17.159" style="s2">criticality a crisis a true crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.409" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">the Bronze Age sense yes and my life</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.159" end="00:26:23.429" style="s2">left me with a certain capacity to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:25.350" style="s2">clearly meaning to take things slowly</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.429" end="00:26:27.330" style="s2">and be able to notice when something was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.350" end="00:26:31.259" style="s2">logically sound and when the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.330" end="00:26:34.529" style="s2">was what it was and so as I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.259" end="00:26:35.909" style="s2">holding more and more and more examples</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.529" end="00:26:38.940" style="s2">of evidence of the fact that this was</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.909" end="00:26:41.129" style="s2">the case I found myself compelled to</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.940" end="00:26:42.600" style="s2">step in to trying to address it and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.129" end="00:26:47.009" style="s2">then led to the journey that leads us</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.600" end="00:26:49.259" style="s2">here which is to say that the approach</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.009" end="00:26:51.980" style="s2">of proposition they approached it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.259" end="00:26:57.240" style="s2">apparently started in the West around</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.980" end="00:26:57.990" style="s2">1050 or address the problem and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.240" end="00:27:01.379" style="s2">really as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.990" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">mm-hmm and you can&#39;t get there from here</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.379" end="00:27:05.429" style="s2">we can spend some time talking about why</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">we can spend time I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.429" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">how it fails for those who&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">trying it&#39;s be useful to notice why</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:15.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the case but the the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.740" end="00:27:19.830" style="s2">jumping at the end game won&#39;t work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.480" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">a not the right tool and so okay well</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:25.649" style="s2">then what and then that leads to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:27.990" style="s2">turning inward and it turning into all</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.649" end="00:27:30.570" style="s2">the stuff that you&#39;ve been hitting just</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.990" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">even in this conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.570" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">but I feel is almost a brilliance</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.040" end="00:27:42.540" style="s2">bringing to a very narrow path a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.570" end="00:27:45.980" style="s2">narrow window which is for us to make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.540" end="00:27:49.080" style="s2">as a species through the exterior</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.980" end="00:27:52.290" style="s2">aspects of the crisis that we find we</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.080" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">must as individuals first make it</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:01.110" style="s2">transformed and to be allowing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.590" end="00:28:03.330" style="s2">to be intimately and vulnerably</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.110" end="00:28:05.580" style="s2">transformed by the reality that is in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.330" end="00:28:06.870" style="s2">fact simply there and to be in</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.580" end="00:28:09.420" style="s2">relationship with them with nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.870" end="00:28:11.070" style="s2">between us and it so that we can at long</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.420" end="00:28:15.210" style="s2">last respond to what is really happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.070" end="00:28:16.800" style="s2">and discover in ourselves that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.210" end="00:28:18.870" style="s2">to be responsive to what is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.800" end="00:28:21.090" style="s2">happening which is such a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.870" end="00:28:23.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s literally right there right in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.090" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">front of us is that our at our hands</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.960" end="00:28:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s really a choice to be able to reach</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">out and grab the response to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.280" end="00:28:35.580" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">thank you I thought that was I was very</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.580" end="00:28:45.080" style="s2">very clear I got a professional sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:49.620" style="s2">like how you got here a glad that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.080" end="00:28:54.270" style="s2">articulate the seriousness of though the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.620" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">use of the term crisis because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.270" end="00:29:01.110" style="s2">trying to convey with that term what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:04.650" style="s2">said the deep need for deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.110" end="00:29:07.380" style="s2">transformation and and and your code</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.650" end="00:29:09.150" style="s2">your work your use of the word code my</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.380" end="00:29:11.700" style="s2">use of the word grammar are this is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.150" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">a transformation in what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.700" end="00:29:17.100" style="s2">but more how we&#39;re saying and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:20.940" style="s2">living what we&#39;re saying and and and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.100" end="00:29:22.590" style="s2">need to and that getting back to that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.940" end="00:29:24.140" style="s2">problematic for us precisely because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:27.300" style="s2">the way the code has unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.140" end="00:29:30.210" style="s2">historically mm-hmm and so that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.300" end="00:29:32.940" style="s2">of the crisis and then what I also am</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.210" end="00:29:34.470" style="s2">trying to convey is the the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.940" end="00:29:36.420" style="s2">threat which you&#39;ve already articulated</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.470" end="00:29:38.610" style="s2">so I won&#39;t repeat that I&#39;m also trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.420" end="00:29:40.230" style="s2">to articulate the pervasiveness of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.610" end="00:29:42.450" style="s2">suffering the loss of agency the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.230" end="00:29:43.920" style="s2">distress you know that people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.450" end="00:29:45.420" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.920" end="00:29:48.450" style="s2">you know suicide rates going off alone</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.420" end="00:29:49.890" style="s2">leanness all of these and you if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.450" end="00:29:51.300" style="s2">give you if you look into these</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.890" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">discourses that people are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.300" end="00:29:55.050" style="s2">it they&#39;re often implicitly and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:57.390" style="s2">sometimes explicitly converging on you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.050" end="00:29:59.790" style="s2">know it&#39;s the loss of connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.390" end="00:30:01.950" style="s2">is you know that&#39;s sort of the core</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.790" end="00:30:04.710" style="s2">thing and so I&#39;m trying to get also the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.950" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">pervasiveness of the suffering and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.710" end="00:30:11.400" style="s2">distress and then lastly and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:13.880" style="s2">were you were hinting towards this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.400" end="00:30:17.220" style="s2">degree to which the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.880" end="00:30:20.280" style="s2">causes a mental fog if I can put it that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:23.180" style="s2">way it makes us very incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.280" end="00:30:26.690" style="s2">responding to the other serious issues</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.180" end="00:30:29.280" style="s2">that are urgent and facing us right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.690" end="00:30:32.120" style="s2">and I think that has to go towards a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.280" end="00:30:35.160" style="s2">kind of a sort of a psychological model</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:37.500" style="s2">on that you know a scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.160" end="00:30:39.450" style="s2">when we the research shows that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.500" end="00:30:41.190" style="s2">people are in scarcity for time or food</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.450" end="00:30:43.650" style="s2">they become inflexible in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.190" end="00:30:47.240" style="s2">cognition their capacity for insight</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.650" end="00:30:50.580" style="s2">goes down they tend to become very</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.240" end="00:30:52.410" style="s2">conservative and also fiying of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.580" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2">worldview right there&#39;s all these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.410" end="00:30:56.520" style="s2">that come in with a scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:30:59.700" style="s2">and I think when people are facing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.520" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">scarcity of meaning mentality it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.700" end="00:31:05.900" style="s2">having this very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:08.280" style="s2">is so comprehensive in our cognition the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.900" end="00:31:11.160" style="s2">scarcity mentality is so becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.280" end="00:31:13.020" style="s2">pervasive in our cognition our our lack</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.160" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">of flexibility our incapacity for</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.020" end="00:31:21.300" style="s2">insight our our sense of the in that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:23.700" style="s2">transformation is not sensed as being</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.300" end="00:31:25.020" style="s2">viable for us it is this is also what</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:27.150" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate with the word</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.020" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">crisis that the meaning crisis causes</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.150" end="00:31:32.400" style="s2">this fog and there&#39;s ossification in our</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:34.620" style="s2">cognition that right prevents us from</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.400" end="00:31:37.170" style="s2">responding to the a lot of the threats</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.620" end="00:31:39.720" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to convey all four of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.170" end="00:31:42.180" style="s2">those dimensions with the word crisis</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.720" end="00:31:44.520" style="s2">and and that is exactly why I use that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.180" end="00:31:49.080" style="s2">term I do get some flack from it from</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.520" end="00:31:50.850" style="s2">people but that is exactly why I use the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.080" end="00:31:52.920" style="s2">term that way and I I&#39;m glad that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.850" end="00:31:55.170" style="s2">you have sort of picked up on that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.920" end="00:31:57.059" style="s2">just wanted to spend deepen that because</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.170" end="00:31:59.999" style="s2">it means that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.059" end="00:32:01.589" style="s2">the project that you know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.999" end="00:32:03.479" style="s2">engaged in and I&#39;m engaged in and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.589" end="00:32:06.839" style="s2">when were not engaged in it together is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.479" end="00:32:08.339" style="s2">really maybe I mean you have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.839" end="00:32:09.779" style="s2">about beating self-promotional right but</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.339" end="00:32:12.059" style="s2">I think it really it&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.779" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">project of our time right it is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.059" end="00:32:20.369" style="s2">thing we have to most do right now well</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:21.929" style="s2">I think it&#39;s something that we can&#39;t can</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.369" end="00:32:25.949" style="s2">say without having to worry about being</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.929" end="00:32:27.839" style="s2">self-promotional is that I for me at</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.949" end="00:32:31.489" style="s2">least I believe that to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.839" end="00:32:31.489" style="s2">enough that I am in fact fully committed</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.419" end="00:32:40.759" style="s2">what I mean in sort of the burning of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.459" end="00:32:40.759" style="s2">the boats metaphor we all in metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.199" end="00:32:48.929" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;ve left nothing in other</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.039" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">there&#39;s no portfolio Theory for me this</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.929" end="00:32:56.129" style="s2">is a very specific focused this is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:58.979" style="s2">this is what must happen and I will step</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.129" end="00:33:01.829" style="s2">into that foot and you know obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.979" end="00:33:08.039" style="s2">could be some variation between error</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.829" end="00:33:09.149" style="s2">and insane but at least I can say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.039" end="00:33:12.619" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.149" end="00:33:15.629" style="s2">and I think that there&#39;s a clarity</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.619" end="00:33:17.969" style="s2">anyone who is perceiving and I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.629" end="00:33:20.699" style="s2">this is also I&#39;ve been endearing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.969" end="00:33:23.149" style="s2">when one watches what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.699" end="00:33:25.799" style="s2">your series that this is also felt</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.149" end="00:33:27.689" style="s2">you&#39;re in mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.799" end="00:33:31.049" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it you are fully in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.689" end="00:33:34.409" style="s2">doing what you can with as much artistry</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.049" end="00:33:35.399" style="s2">and commitment in it as you can to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.409" end="00:33:40.319" style="s2">the thing that you find to be most</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.399" end="00:33:43.709" style="s2">meaningful I wanted to respond a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.319" end="00:33:47.189" style="s2">bit to this the weaving of crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.709" end="00:33:50.899" style="s2">maybe make it more partly maybe make it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.189" end="00:33:50.899" style="s2">a little bit more first-person or more</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.049" end="00:33:56.789" style="s2">personal sure because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.989" end="00:33:58.619" style="s2">something very fundamental about how a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.789" end="00:34:02.729" style="s2">crisis works particularly in humans</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.619" end="00:34:04.439" style="s2">where and the scarcity piece is</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.729" end="00:34:07.349" style="s2">important it&#39;s like scarcity begets</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.439" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">separateness mm-hmm in separateness</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.349" end="00:34:13.740" style="s2">begets</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:18.060" style="s2">carelessness as opposed to careful this</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.740" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">and carelessness begets scarcity we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.060" end="00:34:23.159" style="s2">right right as I feel a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:30.139" style="s2">what&#39;s begin with scarcity and myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.159" end="00:34:30.139" style="s2">perhaps I have a interior experience of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">hardening proud of reactivity where</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.950" end="00:34:45.629" style="s2">something happens you know driving and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:46.859" style="s2">somebody cuts me off it&#39;s as simple as</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a movement between externalizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.130" end="00:35:13.589" style="s2">noise externalizing separateness</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">externalizing that which is entropy to</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:21.990" style="s2">on the interior which then creates a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.589" end="00:35:24.660" style="s2">movement in the directionality of how</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.990" end="00:35:26.220" style="s2">does one respond to a feeling of lack a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.660" end="00:35:28.380" style="s2">feeling of separateness of feeling of</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.350" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">distinction between real thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">think you said and simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:17.250" style="s2">but that really that really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:20.460" style="s2">resonated with me as you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.070" end="00:38:29.940" style="s2">is between something like simulated</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.840" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">thinking and you know bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.940" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">yourself things like that and and could</p>
