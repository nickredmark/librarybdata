<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">yeah I I think that I mean I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.129" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">to talk to anybody that will come they</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">can disagree with me but Paul Van der</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">clay Jonathan Perot often disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">me but I have a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:06.229" style="s2">affection and respect for them because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">trust them because they come into</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.229" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">difficult dialogue with with you know in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">good faith we&#39;ve lost with that mess</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">right but they come in and in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">they come in with no no I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">open to self correction and to inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna disagree but I&#39;m also going</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">to come in with sort of a reverence for</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">the real possibility that I will learn</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">something from you and you will</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">transform me in ways that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">foresee or anticipate or do on my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">and which people come in with that sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">of orientation then I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">them I want to talk to them when they</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">come in when they have an axe to grind</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">then they want to prove their point and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have a place where I do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">and that&#39;s let&#39;s go into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">Academy and we can argue you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">particular theories there there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">of doing that and though I try to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">know that other than that I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk to people but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">thankfully thankfully I find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">people in both domains that I can talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">to effectively and I think productively</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">well I actually like to talk with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">people from they have very who you say</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">our bad faith but to do it in an empathy</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.350" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:17.600" style="s2">with the empathic listening structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.350" end="00:02:19.970" style="s2">and we bring together people at</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.600" end="00:02:22.370" style="s2">political left political right talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">about topics like abortion you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.370" end="00:02:27.110" style="s2">whatever but they have to follow a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:29.030" style="s2">structure where they have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.110" end="00:02:31.880" style="s2">empathic listening which you you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.030" end="00:02:35.420" style="s2">took part in so as long as there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.880" end="00:02:37.459" style="s2">rule it&#39;s like anybody I&#39;m glad to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.420" end="00:02:39.080" style="s2">with anybody you said it kind of makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.459" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">sure people actually listen to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.080" end="00:02:43.790" style="s2">other instead of just start throwing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:44.989" style="s2">another yeah but that&#39;s one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:46.190" style="s2">think we could slow down here because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.989" end="00:02:47.600" style="s2">want to I want to zero in on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.190" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">because there&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.600" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">interested right now to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:54.019" style="s2">about because I think the difference you</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:56.570" style="s2">pointed to it because I see Socrates as</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.019" end="00:02:58.700" style="s2">doing both what I said at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.570" end="00:03:00.110" style="s2">about that but Socrates also doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.700" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">something analogous to what you did</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.110" end="00:03:03.739" style="s2">that&#39;s the midwifery that he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">he says that he&#39;s like a midwife because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.739" end="00:03:08.390" style="s2">one of the things you I think if I miss</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:09.890" style="s2">if I guess it&#39;s wrong but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.390" end="00:03:11.480" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">that the MP circling do does is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.480" end="00:03:17.030" style="s2">transition people into good faith</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:21.079" style="s2">dialogue oh right and so and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.030" end="00:03:23.959" style="s2">that&#39;s a missing and I think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.079" end="00:03:26.090" style="s2">your critique or criticism and which way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.959" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">ever way you want to put it that I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.090" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">not sort of looked more at empathy or</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.930" end="00:03:35.269" style="s2">empathy circling and there&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:37.610" style="s2">missing piece i I want to acknowledge on</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.269" end="00:03:39.230" style="s2">you should know just so just to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.610" end="00:03:41.690" style="s2">explicit I&#39;m going to directly talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.230" end="00:03:44.209" style="s2">about empathy circling in the after</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.690" end="00:03:46.130" style="s2">Socrates series the first half of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.209" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">series is about the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.130" end="00:03:49.220" style="s2">historical development of dialectic but</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:51.290" style="s2">I want to put that if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.220" end="00:03:54.019" style="s2">the pun into dialogue with all these new</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.290" end="00:03:56.600" style="s2">emerging practices around trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.019" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">to authentic dialogue and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.600" end="00:04:02.180" style="s2">think I mean I think what you&#39;ve I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:03.859" style="s2">we just said is really important in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.180" end="00:04:05.690" style="s2">one of the things that when Peter Peter</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.859" end="00:04:07.850" style="s2">Lindbergh isn&#39;t also tonight and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.690" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">talked about after because we said like</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.850" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">because we&#39;re doing a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:13.489" style="s2">modalities right and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:16.459" style="s2">participant observation and what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.489" end="00:04:17.539" style="s2">talked about in Peter had this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.459" end="00:04:20.060" style="s2">for which I think is really good he said</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.539" end="00:04:22.159" style="s2">it felt like the empathy circling was</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:24.140" style="s2">sort of training a different muscle and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.159" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">some of the other and they sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.140" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">seeming to train different things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:29.449" style="s2">ice</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:30.850" style="s2">to him I said I wonder and if they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.449" end="00:04:33.710" style="s2">be put into sort of a programmatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.850" end="00:04:36.919" style="s2">relationship and I hope you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.710" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">this as as being diminutive trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.919" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">diminish the importance of empathy sir</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.840" end="00:04:43.100" style="s2">going I&#39;m trying to do the opposite in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">my mind which is that empathy circling</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.100" end="00:04:47.630" style="s2">is this great thing for transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">people into good faith dialog and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.630" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">maybe that could consider you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">perhaps need to get good training in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">empathy circling before you could go</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:04:57.590" style="s2">into sort of the kind of circling the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">guy sense doc talks about which is much</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.590" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">more when people are capable not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">willing or wanting but also capable of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:07.070" style="s2">entering into deep good-faith dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:10.789" style="s2">then you can sort of do this extra stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.070" end="00:05:12.199" style="s2">with it so that&#39;s how I see it is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.789" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">the empathy a circle is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.199" end="00:05:18.710" style="s2">gateway practice but it is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:20.389" style="s2">foundational gateway practice it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.710" end="00:05:23.599" style="s2">like anybody can do it with sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.389" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">minimal exactly exactly and then which</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.599" end="00:05:27.800" style="s2">means it can spread very widely which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:29.810" style="s2">sort of the thing I&#39;ve been focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.800" end="00:05:31.460" style="s2">is how do we sort of spread this</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.810" end="00:05:34.010" style="s2">practice you know throughout the culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.460" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">is it something anyone the culture can</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.010" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">do and just by observing it if we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">have like politicians if we could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:47.690" style="s2">you know like when when Trump Pelosi</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:49.400" style="s2">Schumer and pence were in this in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.690" end="00:05:50.780" style="s2">Oval Office they&#39;re having this you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.400" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">banter between each other aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.780" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">permanent if they would have done an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">embassy circle with each other it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">like the whole country would have seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:05:59.599" style="s2">it and they would have picked it up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:01.940" style="s2">it would be like that so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.599" end="00:06:03.370" style="s2">model it people can pick it up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.940" end="00:06:05.960" style="s2">this gateway to all those different</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.370" end="00:06:07.849" style="s2">practices that you&#39;re I think they got</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.960" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">talking about that whole constellation</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.849" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">of practices and it&#39;s like making it</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:14.300" style="s2">deeper but that&#39;s why I really focused</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">on on this and there actually are our</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.300" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">topic actually is like what is the role</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.580" end="00:06:21.229" style="s2">of empathy in your your work so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard it you know I mentioned I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.229" end="00:06:26.030" style="s2">don&#39;t we haven&#39;t talked about empathy</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s really a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.030" end="00:06:30.110" style="s2">practice and and you had sent the you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:31.880" style="s2">know just said well maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.110" end="00:06:33.889" style="s2">start off by like what are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.880" end="00:06:36.469" style="s2">about when real good including empathy</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.889" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">rights like what is it definitions that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.469" end="00:06:42.870" style="s2">we&#39;re talking abit of a mess out there</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:45.270" style="s2">in terms of what people are calling</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.870" end="00:06:48.180" style="s2">empathy there and I sent you that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.270" end="00:06:50.460" style="s2">article that paper buddy Dan Batson he</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.180" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">lays it out pretty well you know just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.460" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">basic framework for it so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:07:00.210" style="s2">starting point I think it is so two</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:03.540" style="s2">points on that the first the many I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.210" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">this is a this is a prevalent problem in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.540" end="00:07:07.949" style="s2">psychology where the same term is used</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:09.690" style="s2">in multiple different ways and so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.949" end="00:07:11.160" style="s2">really that really makes the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.690" end="00:07:13.380" style="s2">equivocation a neat problem in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.160" end="00:07:16.320" style="s2">psychology and so I have avoided the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.380" end="00:07:19.080" style="s2">term empathy perhaps I was mistaken but</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.320" end="00:07:21.389" style="s2">maybe not it looks to me from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.080" end="00:07:22.830" style="s2">outside and the article you sent me sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.389" end="00:07:25.470" style="s2">of assignments to support this that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.830" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">there are many different meanings and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.470" end="00:07:29.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t or they are of this term and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:32.340" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I hesitated in using it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.880" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s and some particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.340" end="00:07:36.750" style="s2">meanings have come unto a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.340" style="s2">criticism like the criticism that bloom</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.750" end="00:07:40.500" style="s2">is made I know you have responses to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.340" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">that just try to explain why I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.500" end="00:07:45.090" style="s2">held off in using the term because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:46.650" style="s2">was funny like what people like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.090" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">what am I saying when I invoke this term</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.650" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">either I spend a lot of time like trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:55.710" style="s2">to stipulate it or I just think I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:57.660" style="s2">put it aside now here&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.710" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">to actually give it the foregrounding</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:02.760" style="s2">that it needs but the second thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">like to bring into that defining is I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.760" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">want a definition that makes focal and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:08.970" style="s2">central the very thing you just put your</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:11.220" style="s2">finger on a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.970" end="00:08:14.460" style="s2">I want a definition of empathy that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.220" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">helps me explain the transition from bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.460" end="00:08:20.039" style="s2">faith to good faith dialogue so I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:21.780" style="s2">to reverse-engineer empathy from that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.039" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">important and I think you agree that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.780" end="00:08:26.039" style="s2">central function that we as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.810" style="s2">needed today or so I&#39;m gonna be a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.039" end="00:08:29.849" style="s2">bit bold here Edwin if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.810" end="00:08:31.830" style="s2">definition of IDI there&#39;s a definition</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.849" end="00:08:35.700" style="s2">coming from Edwin that doesn&#39;t tell me</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.830" end="00:08:37.080" style="s2">you know explain how empathy gets people</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.700" end="00:08:39.479" style="s2">from bad faith to good faith dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.080" end="00:08:41.459" style="s2">I&#39;m not that interested in it because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.479" end="00:08:43.080" style="s2">think we have the shared idea that no</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.459" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">this is really really needed right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.080" end="00:08:47.190" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s really central to as</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:49.890" style="s2">you also seem to agree with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.190" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">important projects so let&#39;s open up what</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.890" end="00:08:55.460" style="s2">it means but I want to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">function the central thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.460" end="00:08:59.779" style="s2">understand what is empathy and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:02.029" style="s2">explanation is such that it explains to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.779" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">me this function of taking people from</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">bad faith to good faith dialog is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:08.270" style="s2">is that fair yeah yeah that&#39;s great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:11.210" style="s2">visit your said there&#39;s a practicality</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.270" end="00:09:14.330" style="s2">to that yes yeah this is a practical</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.210" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">definition it&#39;s not just you know looks</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.330" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">like this is something we can use and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what I really appreciate about</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">the value of empathy is the practicality</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:25.520" style="s2">of it and because I see it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:29.330" style="s2">like you know I do empathic listening</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.520" end="00:09:30.680" style="s2">with people I do mediation and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.330" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">empathy that&#39;s sort of the key</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.680" end="00:09:35.300" style="s2">ingredient for you know bridging that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:35.960" style="s2">meaning crisis I would say yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.300" end="00:09:38.270" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.960" end="00:09:41.450" style="s2">and so the work I do is pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.270" end="00:09:43.610" style="s2">based on work of Carl Rogers so he had</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.450" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">definitions I&#39;d sent you that definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.610" end="00:09:49.460" style="s2">yes I saw the of empathy you know he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">a I think really a paper and he gave it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.460" end="00:09:54.710" style="s2">he presented the paper you know he gave</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.100" end="00:09:56.690" style="s2">his definitions he laid it out he spent</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.710" end="00:09:58.520" style="s2">like 40 years doing it Pat you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.690" end="00:10:01.730" style="s2">developing empathic listening</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.520" end="00:10:05.690" style="s2">in a therapeutic context and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.730" end="00:10:07.220" style="s2">promoted it so it&#39;s his work and at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.690" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">core it kind of the most simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.220" end="00:10:13.490" style="s2">definition or is a metaphor of going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">someone else&#39;s journey with them yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.490" end="00:10:18.020" style="s2">I&#39;m going I&#39;m sitting here I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of going I&#39;m speaking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.020" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">following my journey right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">you&#39;re present with me I can feel you</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:26.660" style="s2">being present</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.900" style="s2">you know sensing into what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:31.459" style="s2">and you know and you&#39;re you&#39;re going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.900" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">my journey you&#39;re not saying no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.459" end="00:10:35.330" style="s2">wrong you&#39;re this you might be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.370" style="s2">some things but you&#39;re still have that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.330" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">presence and so you&#39;re going on my</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.370" end="00:10:40.790" style="s2">journey and then also the other part I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:43.459" style="s2">would say is the emphasis I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.790" end="00:10:46.910" style="s2">define empathy within the context of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.459" end="00:10:49.490" style="s2">empathy circle too so we have something</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.910" end="00:10:52.730" style="s2">tangible that we&#39;re defining it with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.490" end="00:10:54.589" style="s2">though so here it is you&#39;ve been you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.730" end="00:10:56.540" style="s2">been following me and then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.589" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">okay now I&#39;m gonna follow you right</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.540" end="00:11:00.740" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna switch I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">empathize with you and follow you on</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.740" end="00:11:06.140" style="s2">your journey and and hear you yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s just the sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.140" end="00:11:08.570" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:11.210" style="s2">just the starting point no but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.570" end="00:11:13.130" style="s2">great okay so that that thank you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.210" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">that brings up a couple of points I want</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.130" end="00:11:17.420" style="s2">to first of all I like this idea of sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:19.610" style="s2">of you know participating in somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.420" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">other sort of sort of what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.610" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">respect I will knowing like and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:27.980" style="s2">leads to a point that I think I want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:30.830" style="s2">explicate and draw from your work that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.980" end="00:11:32.090" style="s2">you are thinking of empathy as just an</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.830" end="00:11:34.670" style="s2">affective state</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.090" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking of if I&#39;m following your</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.670" end="00:11:38.450" style="s2">journey the way you&#39;re talking about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.680" end="00:11:40.580" style="s2">not just having sort of the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.450" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">affective state I&#39;m also trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.580" end="00:11:44.270" style="s2">how you&#39;re making sense of things if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:47.210" style="s2">following your journey there&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.270" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">cognitive aspect to this project it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.210" end="00:11:51.860" style="s2">not just an effective response and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:53.750" style="s2">think that&#39;s important because many of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.860" end="00:11:55.640" style="s2">the definitions are you know this many</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.750" end="00:11:58.280" style="s2">of the definitions of empathy reduce it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.640" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">to a kind of effective response or an</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.280" end="00:12:03.350" style="s2">effective resonance between two people</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:05.780" style="s2">and and and then it&#39;s like okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.350" end="00:12:08.270" style="s2">that for me that carries no moral</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.780" end="00:12:09.830" style="s2">implications if I just share your pain I</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.270" end="00:12:12.380" style="s2">might just run away from you because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.830" end="00:12:14.360" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be in pain and but your</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.380" end="00:12:16.940" style="s2">notion of you know following somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.360" end="00:12:19.490" style="s2">else&#39;s journey is oh no no I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.940" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">sort of in in you know sharing an</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.490" end="00:12:23.630" style="s2">affective state with you that affective</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:26.930" style="s2">state is bound up with its facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.630" end="00:12:28.610" style="s2">and affording trying to get deeply get</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.930" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">this is what I mean about perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.610" end="00:12:32.540" style="s2">knowing how you&#39;re making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:34.670" style="s2">things that&#39;s why in the empathy</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.540" end="00:12:37.280" style="s2">circling I like the part where you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.670" end="00:12:39.620" style="s2">to sort of say back to the person I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.280" end="00:12:41.330" style="s2">understood you right it&#39;s about have you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.620" end="00:12:43.280" style="s2">understood me yeah you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.330" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">getting a check you&#39;re getting a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.280" end="00:12:49.700" style="s2">a yeah message sent message received</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:51.020" style="s2">accurately sort of yeah so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.700" end="00:12:53.270" style="s2">is one point we should emphasize right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.020" end="00:12:55.310" style="s2">away and I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.270" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">connections to some of my constructs I</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.310" end="00:13:00.620" style="s2">hope I hope you find that using a great</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.620" end="00:13:03.080" style="s2">answer I&#39;m looking forward to so I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.620" end="00:13:05.300" style="s2">this idea of thinking of it more as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.080" end="00:13:08.780" style="s2">whole person thing it&#39;s got serious</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.300" end="00:13:11.380" style="s2">cognitive aspects to it and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.780" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">think of it in terms of apart our</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.380" end="00:13:16.370" style="s2">participatory knowing and knowing by in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">some sense identifying with people so</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.370" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">that I can get right I can enact for</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.450" style="s2">myself too</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">degree there perspectival knowing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.450" end="00:13:28.520" style="s2">seeing how they&#39;re making sense of a</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.520" end="00:13:33.050" style="s2">how they&#39;re framing others sizing up</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.260" end="00:13:34.580" style="s2">also how they&#39;re identifying with that</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.950" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">right there&#39;s no landscape of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.290" end="00:13:50.900" style="s2">whole there&#39;s a landscape of their</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">that are happening in their being and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:13:57.170" style="s2">you&#39;re just sort of moving into their</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:58.820" style="s2">world into their landscape of all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.170" end="00:14:00.650" style="s2">different relationships or their self</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.820" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">relationships how they&#39;re putting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.650" end="00:14:05.390" style="s2">world together and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">exploring that and not bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.390" end="00:14:10.670" style="s2">you&#39;re just bringing in your presence to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:13.130" style="s2">follow them to get a sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.670" end="00:14:16.040" style="s2">landscape and it&#39;s the felt the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.130" end="00:14:18.830" style="s2">thing I would say is I know there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.040" end="00:14:21.380" style="s2">talk about you know the emotions and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.830" end="00:14:23.840" style="s2">cognitive but it&#39;s so intertwined yes or</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.380" end="00:14:25.790" style="s2">no you can even this whole thing of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.840" end="00:14:27.350" style="s2">affective and cognitive it&#39;s all so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.790" end="00:14:31.640" style="s2">intertwined I don&#39;t think you can even</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.350" end="00:14:34.430" style="s2">really clearly tease it apart I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.640" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">wanting to tease it alone in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.430" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">know I argue in my series for the deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">interpenetration of cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:44.089" style="s2">emotion and motivation and effect in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">general I think that I think what I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.089" end="00:14:48.350" style="s2">trying to do was I was trying to resist</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:50.330" style="s2">the reduction I think the overly</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.350" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">simplistic reduction of empathy to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.330" end="00:14:54.410" style="s2">purely affective right uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:56.420" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what yeah there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.410" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">mapping there&#39;s a map when you have map</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.420" end="00:15:00.500" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing things in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.330" style="s2">to each other so there is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.500" end="00:15:04.670" style="s2">just a felt experience but those felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.330" end="00:15:07.130" style="s2">experiences have relationships to each</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.670" end="00:15:09.550" style="s2">other yeah maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.130" end="00:15:11.750" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m pointing down right</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.550" end="00:15:13.430" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of trying to get the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.750" end="00:15:15.470" style="s2">person not with just the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.430" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">the mind or the machinery of the heart</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.470" end="00:15:19.160" style="s2">but if you&#39;ll allow me sort of with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:20.839" style="s2">machinery of yourself I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.160" end="00:15:22.310" style="s2">figure out how if you&#39;ll allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.839" end="00:15:23.570" style="s2">turn this into a verb I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.310" end="00:15:25.640" style="s2">figure out how you&#39;re sort of selfing</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:27.860" style="s2">right now how you&#39;re sort of configuring</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.640" end="00:15:29.690" style="s2">yourself and you know Co configuring the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.860" end="00:15:31.490" style="s2">world and trying to fit yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">world together that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.490" end="00:15:34.060" style="s2">get and here&#39;s why I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:37.210" style="s2">important Edwin</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.060" end="00:15:40.690" style="s2">I hope you you think this might be away</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.210" end="00:15:44.530" style="s2">I mean I know Paul and so okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.690" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">have an empathy circle with you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:48.250" style="s2">trying for five years to have an empathy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.740" style="s2">circle you won&#39;t talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.250" end="00:15:51.700" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know him well I&#39;ve only met</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.740" end="00:15:53.800" style="s2">him and I&#39;ve had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.700" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">conversations with him I might be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.800" end="00:15:59.560" style="s2">to get into a conversation with him I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:02.980" style="s2">know he likes my work a lot but so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.560" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">agree with him if please remember the if</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.980" end="00:16:08.530" style="s2">if empathy was just that shared effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:11.860" style="s2">then I like I think it&#39;s morally neutral</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.530" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">but if what we mean by empathy is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.860" end="00:16:17.050" style="s2">sort of like in acting for myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:19.540" style="s2">getting buy-in acting your selfing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.050" end="00:16:21.760" style="s2">here as his has huge moral implications</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.540" end="00:16:24.100" style="s2">in fact I can&#39;t enter into a proper</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.760" end="00:16:27.400" style="s2">moral relationship with you if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.100" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">in actively get yourself in knots so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.400" end="00:16:32.950" style="s2">think that&#39;s a deep way if we understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:34.960" style="s2">empathy of being able to respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.950" end="00:16:36.490" style="s2">kind of critique and say no no this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.960" end="00:16:38.740" style="s2">what we mean by empathy we don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.490" end="00:16:42.340" style="s2">mean the shared outfit yeah so there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.740" end="00:16:45.130" style="s2">it sorry there there is a feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.340" end="00:16:46.900" style="s2">like I&#39;m feeling your excitement really</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.130" end="00:16:49.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s like your excitement is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.900" end="00:16:51.730" style="s2">like overwhelmingly and I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.060" end="00:16:53.260" style="s2">overly you know what in your excitement</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.730" end="00:16:54.850" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what bloom is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.260" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">criticizing you say oh you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.850" end="00:16:59.080" style="s2">all excited I&#39;m gonna get all excited</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:00.970" style="s2">yes yes so that I have a sit I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.080" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">feeling into your being</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.970" end="00:17:04.630" style="s2">oh I&#39;m feeling you&#39;re excited you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:07.060" style="s2">what&#39;s beyond that excitement what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.630" end="00:17:10.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the bigger picture so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.060" end="00:17:13.060" style="s2">being concerned in fact if I got totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.680" end="00:17:15.660" style="s2">you can do that I can get totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.060" end="00:17:18.250" style="s2">excited and I lose my connection to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.660" end="00:17:20.710" style="s2">exactly I actually what Paul is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.250" end="00:17:23.020" style="s2">criticizing I actually agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.710" end="00:17:25.840" style="s2">estate that he is you know criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.020" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">is actually it&#39;s it&#39;s a block to empathy</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.840" end="00:17:31.510" style="s2">as I&#39;m sort of explaining it so in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:34.150" style="s2">sense I agree in that sense but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.510" end="00:17:36.100" style="s2">call that empathy he&#39;s like state</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.150" end="00:17:39.610" style="s2">matching orders could be any number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.100" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">reasons you get into that that matching</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.610" end="00:17:43.210" style="s2">state so yeah so I just want to throw</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">that in no no I think that&#39;s good I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.210" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">think what that is why I like this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.059" style="s2">of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.620" end="00:17:51.430" style="s2">because sense has both sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.059" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">cognitive meaning like making sense but</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.430" end="00:17:55.330" style="s2">it also has a sensorial meaning like</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:57.220" style="s2">actually sensing and feeling like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.330" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">said I&#39;m trying to pick up on that with</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.220" end="00:18:04.270" style="s2">that term and the reader the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:06.430" style="s2">I were circling no pun intended on this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.270" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">is you know one of the definitions in</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.430" end="00:18:10.059" style="s2">the paper was the idea of empathy as</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:12.700" style="s2">emotional contagion which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.059" end="00:18:14.230" style="s2">what you were right yeah just having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.700" end="00:18:16.360" style="s2">few minutes ago an emotional an</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.230" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">emotional contagion as you yourself say</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.360" end="00:18:21.010" style="s2">can actually be deeply disruptive it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:23.470" style="s2">disconnect people and it can motivate</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.010" end="00:18:27.790" style="s2">them to immoral behavior I think very</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.470" end="00:18:32.110" style="s2">clearly but it&#39;s mom kind of mob and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.790" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">lots of things yes so I think trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.110" end="00:18:39.160" style="s2">get this I&#39;m glad we have this forum you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:43.030" style="s2">know where we&#39;re trying to get very</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.160" end="00:18:44.500" style="s2">clear on you know a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.030" end="00:18:46.120" style="s2">reformulation of empathy that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.500" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">distinguish it from these other things I</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.120" end="00:18:52.110" style="s2">think would be tremendously helpful now</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:54.250" style="s2">so what can I like this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.110" end="00:18:55.390" style="s2">following somebody on a journey in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.250" end="00:18:57.580" style="s2">way we&#39;ve been talking about it this</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.390" end="00:18:59.380" style="s2">sort of you know a participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.580" end="00:19:01.900" style="s2">of other people&#39;s perspective on knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.380" end="00:19:04.809" style="s2">of getting into getting and feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.900" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">getting into see babies speak both sides</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.809" end="00:19:09.400" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling into it getting into how</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:12.550" style="s2">somebody is selfing and world Inge I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.400" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">that as really important and at that if</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.550" end="00:19:17.050" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also important for another</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">reason because this idea of getting into</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.050" end="00:19:21.610" style="s2">how somebody is selfing in world a might</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:23.980" style="s2">help to explain why empathy can move</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.610" end="00:19:28.600" style="s2">people from bad faith to good faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.980" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">dialogue do you see what yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.600" end="00:19:32.800" style="s2">talk about so somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:35.110" style="s2">talking and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.800" end="00:19:38.830" style="s2">manipulate you and you just listen to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.110" end="00:19:40.660" style="s2">the you listen to the to the to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.830" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">the all the different things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.660" end="00:19:44.650" style="s2">there&#39;s you know trying to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">there and then you just hear it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.650" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">like oh I hear you&#39;re really you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.360" end="00:19:50.950" style="s2">this is going on for you and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">like it just arms them it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.950" end="00:19:55.690" style="s2">you&#39;re actually listening to me they</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">might have anger I hear you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.690" end="00:19:59.950" style="s2">angry is is they&#39;re more like yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">then you go into it and it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.950" end="00:20:02.980" style="s2">if this arm</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.420" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and then they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.980" end="00:20:06.550" style="s2">this feels pretty good I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.420" end="00:20:09.730" style="s2">being heard and then they kind of open</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.550" end="00:20:12.670" style="s2">up and they said there&#39;s a deeper truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.730" end="00:20:17.470" style="s2">I find it kind of comes up over time if</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.670" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">you another question that might help</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.470" end="00:20:22.360" style="s2">give kiss give even more distinctive</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:23.590" style="s2">clarity so what&#39;s the difference because</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.360" end="00:20:28.030" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a difference in what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.590" end="00:20:30.670" style="s2">just said between listening to someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.030" end="00:20:32.560" style="s2">so they&#39;re heard and listening to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.670" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">someone and being convinced by them cuz</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.560" end="00:20:36.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be convinced by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.210" end="00:20:37.930" style="s2"> artist right I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.130" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">convinced because then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.930" end="00:20:40.840" style="s2">artist is that we&#39;re not gonna connect</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:42.610" style="s2">the artists that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.840" end="00:20:44.890" style="s2">manipulate me he&#39;s gonna treat her</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.610" end="00:20:46.870" style="s2">myself deceptive machinery my defensive</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.890" end="00:20:49.300" style="s2">machinery so what what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.870" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">what is empathy doing that is allowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.300" end="00:20:53.860" style="s2">you to listen so the person feels heard</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:55.480" style="s2">without you thereby being convinced or</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:20:57.040" style="s2">manipulated by them if they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.480" end="00:20:58.810" style="s2">something in bad faith because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.040" end="00:21:01.030" style="s2">what we&#39;re zeroing in now on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.810" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">how do we get from the bad faith to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.030" end="00:21:05.920" style="s2">good face so what&#39;s the difference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">I there&#39;s a guy named Sam Vaknin he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.920" end="00:21:11.920" style="s2">he&#39;s in the in Europe and he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:14.260" style="s2">book called malignant self-love and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.920" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of the go-to guy that you go</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.260" end="00:21:20.020" style="s2">through for a narcissistic psychopath</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:22.600" style="s2">right he&#39;s created a you know a media</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.020" end="00:21:24.970" style="s2">persona of being and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.600" end="00:21:26.860" style="s2">documentary about him that they traveled</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.970" end="00:21:29.020" style="s2">to these different research centers for</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">studying psychopathy and they tested him</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.020" end="00:21:33.370" style="s2">and he actually tested you know positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:36.430" style="s2">for for this and so I&#39;ve done a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.370" end="00:21:38.590" style="s2">interviews with him and I did we did an</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.430" end="00:21:42.220" style="s2">embassy we did a couple empathy circles</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.590" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of amazing that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.220" end="00:21:46.750" style="s2">he kind of started opening up by instead</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.440" end="00:21:49.630" style="s2">of trying to manipulate me to get what</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.750" end="00:21:52.870" style="s2">he sort of wanted you know it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.630" end="00:21:57.970" style="s2">was able to share hid what he who he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.870" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">and be heard by me and then likewise he</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.970" end="00:22:02.710" style="s2">I was able to be heard he was reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:07.810" style="s2">me he was following me on my journey and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.710" end="00:22:10.900" style="s2">her sort of a there&#39;s sort of a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.810" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">truth that comes through in overtime</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.900" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">with that in it I can share my truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">plus if it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">than just having two people the more</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:20.049" style="s2">people you get that&#39;s are like four</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:23.770" style="s2">people in the circle because you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.049" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">multiple points of so that creates a bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.770" end="00:22:27.910" style="s2">of a safety as well that if you just get</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.010" style="s2">with two people and they&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.910" end="00:22:31.809" style="s2">back and forth you can kind of get kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.010" end="00:22:34.750" style="s2">of bogged down the more points of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.809" end="00:22:36.670" style="s2">reference of reality you have there</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.750" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">creates it creates the sense of safety I</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.670" end="00:22:41.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s sort of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">part of it okay the last point you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.290" end="00:22:45.040" style="s2">it makes good sense to me using sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">distributed cognition and yeah Chuck</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.040" end="00:22:49.690" style="s2">okay so I think I think that&#39;s and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:53.460" style="s2">course that I think overlaps with sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.690" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">of Socratic dialectic in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.460" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">and I&#39;m getting I like this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">deeper truth so this is what this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.919" end="00:23:06.160" style="s2">what it&#39;s sounding like to me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:09.970" style="s2">well sometimes what people often what</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.160" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">people think they want in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.970" end="00:23:13.240" style="s2">especially they&#39;re coming in with bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:15.640" style="s2">faith is they want belief transmission I</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.240" end="00:23:16.990" style="s2">want to give you my beliefs that way</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.640" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">I&#39;ll be able to predict and you control</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.990" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">your behavior but it sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">the deeper truth is almost like the high</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:27.970" style="s2">daguerreian Alafaya what people often</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:29.650" style="s2">want and what they perhaps know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.970" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me what they really want is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.650" end="00:23:36.370" style="s2">connectedness yeah and a mutual opening</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:39.669" style="s2">but right rather than right rather than</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.370" end="00:23:42.700" style="s2">you know belief transmission and so is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.669" end="00:23:44.470" style="s2">is that the key that you listen in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.700" end="00:23:46.330" style="s2">in which you&#39;re not getting locked into</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.470" end="00:23:48.580" style="s2">sort of belief transmission you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.330" end="00:23:51.700" style="s2">trying to listen in a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.580" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to shift the person on to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.700" end="00:23:56.260" style="s2">paying attention to that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:58.179" style="s2">connectedness which they create yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.260" end="00:24:00.309" style="s2">that a good way yeah I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.179" end="00:24:02.820" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about demeaning crisis it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.309" end="00:24:05.890" style="s2">which is feeling disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.820" end="00:24:08.410" style="s2">disconnected from your own real felt</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.890" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">experience yeah you have disconnection</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.410" end="00:24:14.049" style="s2">from other people&#39;s felt experience so</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">the fantastic process of just fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.049" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">hearing somebody is sort of a connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:21.820" style="s2">building process and that connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:24.669" style="s2">when you start feeling connected it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.820" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">like your your fear goes down right</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.669" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">there and the fear itself is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:31.049" style="s2">disconnecting you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.200" end="00:24:33.239" style="s2">process so the more we can get away past</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.049" end="00:24:35.340" style="s2">fear the more we can sort of feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.239" end="00:24:38.730" style="s2">connected and the more we feel connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:42.059" style="s2">it creates a positive spiral towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.730" end="00:24:43.950" style="s2">deeper deeper connection over time so</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.059" end="00:24:47.509" style="s2">yeah a reciprocal opening as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.950" end="00:24:50.009" style="s2">participant of Ladera link yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.509" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">that seems to be implying and I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.009" end="00:24:55.109" style="s2">agree with this implication that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.909" style="s2">one of the core underlying motives of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.109" end="00:25:00.299" style="s2">bad faith dialog is a kind of fear</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.909" end="00:25:02.090" style="s2">motivation whereas when people if they</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.299" end="00:25:05.190" style="s2">can if you can sort of get them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.090" end="00:25:09.389" style="s2">connect you you you you shift them from</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.190" end="00:25:11.190" style="s2">avoiding fear to pursuing connection and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.389" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">that&#39;s how you can shift people from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.190" end="00:25:14.970" style="s2">bad faith dialogue which is fear driven</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.409" style="s2">to a good faith dialogue which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.970" end="00:25:19.470" style="s2">connection seeking or connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.409" end="00:25:24.779" style="s2">cultivating is that yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.470" end="00:25:27.090" style="s2">so yeah it it you do start over time I</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.779" end="00:25:30.629" style="s2">mean I you know we have like I said</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.090" end="00:25:36.259" style="s2">we&#39;ve done left-right dialogues so on</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.629" end="00:25:38.820" style="s2">you know gun control gun violence on on</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.259" end="00:25:39.929" style="s2">abortion you know people have really</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.820" end="00:25:41.879" style="s2">strong feelings</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.929" end="00:25:44.429" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s easy they share something</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.879" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t feel heard a wall goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.429" end="00:25:49.350" style="s2">up right it&#39;s like they get tense you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.970" style="s2">can just feel the tension and then but</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.350" end="00:25:52.889" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay what I&#39;m hearing is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.970" end="00:25:55.320" style="s2">this this you know you&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.889" end="00:25:58.919" style="s2">hear them and then the they get more</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.320" end="00:26:01.499" style="s2">relaxed right and then but then then if</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.919" end="00:26:02.970" style="s2">there&#39;s also the mutuality of it at</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.499" end="00:26:05.159" style="s2">least in the empathy circle where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.970" end="00:26:07.799" style="s2">just not the other person doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.159" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">talking it&#39;s a mutual so that act feels</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.799" end="00:26:11.580" style="s2">pretty good there&#39;s a sense of fairness</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:14.820" style="s2">within it so that fairness within the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.580" end="00:26:16.889" style="s2">empathy circle helps so right but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.820" end="00:26:18.419" style="s2">looking it so the real dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.889" end="00:26:21.029" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on here well</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.419" end="00:26:24.389" style="s2">that&#39;sthat&#39;s what I what yeah what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.029" end="00:26:25.769" style="s2">have you know I wanna and I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.389" end="00:26:27.480" style="s2">to you for being such a willing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.769" end="00:26:30.749" style="s2">participant in this I want to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.480" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">between the cognitive science and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.749" end="00:26:35.519" style="s2">practicality I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:36.929" style="s2">understand you know in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.519" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">cognitive science what are the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.929" end="00:26:42.090" style="s2">processes what are the dynamics going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:45.180" style="s2">because well I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.090" end="00:26:47.580" style="s2">it would serve your practice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.180" end="00:26:49.890" style="s2">happening here is a way of getting you</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.580" end="00:26:51.660" style="s2">know good responses to misunderstandings</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.890" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">and miss framing of empathy circling I</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.660" end="00:26:56.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s a clear potential benefit</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:27:00.150" style="s2">but also I think if if I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.850" end="00:27:01.980" style="s2">understand if you&#39;ll allow me this</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.150" end="00:27:05.580" style="s2">metaphor the machinery of the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.980" end="00:27:07.830" style="s2">yeah then I could relate it to other</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.580" end="00:27:09.870" style="s2">developmental processes I could see how</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:11.690" style="s2">empathy circling as a practice could</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.870" end="00:27:14.130" style="s2">more properly coordinate with other</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.690" end="00:27:15.240" style="s2">developmental processes and projects so</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.130" end="00:27:17.190" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.240" end="00:27:18.750" style="s2">to do here right now that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.190" end="00:27:20.790" style="s2">trying to do it yeah well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.750" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">another piece that&#39;s coming to me now is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:27.180" style="s2">that with there&#39;s I&#39;m irresponsible so</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:30.120" style="s2">many dimensions to this one is the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.180" end="00:27:32.370" style="s2">empathic listening was really articulate</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.120" end="00:27:34.800" style="s2">developed within the therapeutic context</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.370" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">right there&#39;s the the listener like Carl</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.800" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">Rogers he would listen to his you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:41.040" style="s2">clients and they would bring all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:43.980" style="s2">of I mean the amount of you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.040" end="00:27:45.330" style="s2">struggles people have the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.980" end="00:27:48.360" style="s2">that they&#39;re bringing their meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.330" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2">crisis is to him he&#39;s just like sitting</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.360" end="00:27:53.160" style="s2">and listening the other part that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:54.900" style="s2">looking at is a relational part that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.160" end="00:27:57.570" style="s2">within the therapeutic part you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.900" end="00:27:59.580" style="s2">your you do have a bit of a distance</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.570" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got the you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.580" end="00:28:05.460" style="s2">professional relationship the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:08.070" style="s2">is not equal in a sense they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.460" end="00:28:10.620" style="s2">sharing their story so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.070" end="00:28:12.570" style="s2">mutually empathic relationship so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.620" end="00:28:14.280" style="s2">another part of it is that that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.570" end="00:28:17.280" style="s2">call it a culture of empathy because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.280" end="00:28:19.320" style="s2">want that mutual the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.280" end="00:28:22.500" style="s2">relationship Parden how do we create and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.320" end="00:28:25.680" style="s2">so the the relationship part is you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">speak in past the CLE - right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.680" end="00:28:31.020" style="s2">just like listening empathically you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:35.130" style="s2">contribute to the empathic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.020" end="00:28:39.180" style="s2">by speaking more and this was the work</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.130" end="00:28:41.700" style="s2">of Jean gentleman yeah I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.180" end="00:28:44.670" style="s2">focusing is he like stable okay who is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.700" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">this who the clients you know who came</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.670" end="00:28:49.830" style="s2">who is moving forward in their growth</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:52.950" style="s2">right they&#39;re in stock they got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.830" end="00:28:55.110" style="s2">meaning crisis you know who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.950" end="00:28:55.559" style="s2">through this empathic listening and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.110" end="00:28:58.379" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.559" end="00:29:00.809" style="s2">some kind of forward motion and from his</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.379" end="00:29:04.379" style="s2">studies it was like the people who spoke</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.809" end="00:29:06.120" style="s2">from a felt present veldt experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.379" end="00:29:09.749" style="s2">like oh right now I&#39;m feeling excited</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.120" end="00:29:12.090" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling concentration you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.749" end="00:29:15.059" style="s2">the concentration is right here I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.090" end="00:29:17.249" style="s2">kind of a spaciousness here and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.059" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">doing that moment a moment - it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.249" end="00:29:21.419" style="s2">oh it&#39;s actually changing just by my</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:23.639" style="s2">sharing the felt experience kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.419" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">starts shifting and then you get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.639" end="00:29:28.230" style="s2">reflection on it that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:31.409" style="s2">contributes to the shifting and so his</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.230" end="00:29:34.230" style="s2">insight was it was the felt experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.409" end="00:29:36.929" style="s2">and identifying it you know sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.230" end="00:29:39.320" style="s2">getting the reflection on it versus kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.929" end="00:29:43.049" style="s2">of spinning and sort of an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.320" end="00:29:45.990" style="s2">writers attached mm-hmm way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.049" end="00:29:47.159" style="s2">in sort of a monotone continuous or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.990" end="00:29:49.169" style="s2">monotone Spacey</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.159" end="00:29:51.210" style="s2">you just don&#39;t move anywhere so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.169" end="00:29:55.049" style="s2">sort of his and he kind of developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:55.590" style="s2">that whole kind of a structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.049" end="00:30:00.950" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.590" end="00:30:03.749" style="s2">so the so now I&#39;m getting a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.950" end="00:30:05.879" style="s2">appropriate let&#39;s call it the empathy</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.749" end="00:30:08.220" style="s2">conducive kind of listening and now you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.879" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">said but it has to be properly conjoined</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.220" end="00:30:13.950" style="s2">with an empathy conducive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">speaking and getting them to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.950" end="00:30:18.419" style="s2">properly together is as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.369" style="s2">challenge I take it yeah and you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.419" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">deepen that&#39;s what it takes to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.369" end="00:30:26.700" style="s2">deepen the experience even at a super</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">you know at that sort of just more bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.700" end="00:30:31.139" style="s2">faith or whatever level you know right</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:34.049" style="s2">right it already it does a lot you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.139" end="00:30:35.909" style="s2">it over time you know we do like family</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.049" end="00:30:38.759" style="s2">empathy circles for hours so this</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.909" end="00:30:40.679" style="s2">together thing and you know it it kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.759" end="00:30:42.869" style="s2">of people are kind of disjointed and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.679" end="00:30:45.389" style="s2">after you know about two hours a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.869" end="00:30:47.909" style="s2">bit more something clicks and people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.389" end="00:30:51.299" style="s2">sort of you just gonna feel this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.909" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">connection that that happens yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.299" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">take it that what happens is you get so</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">sort of this self-organizing system that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:00.179" style="s2">takes shape I&#39;ve noticed that in other</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:03.169" style="s2">other circling practices you get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.179" end="00:31:06.990" style="s2">this people are people feel sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.169" end="00:31:08.970" style="s2">static or just you know this kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.990" end="00:31:10.289" style="s2">one-off connections</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.970" end="00:31:12.690" style="s2">and like you say it&#39;s sort of all</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.289" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">propositional and then it shifts into no</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.690" end="00:31:17.010" style="s2">no now we&#39;re all sort of belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.390" style="s2">this self-organizing system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.010" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">starting to take on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.390" end="00:31:24.270" style="s2">and people started I noticed that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:27.179" style="s2">metaphors shift from sort of pushing</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.270" end="00:31:29.309" style="s2">effort to being drawn people start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.179" end="00:31:30.539" style="s2">say I was you know they do I saying this</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.309" end="00:31:32.460" style="s2">and they sort of pushed their hand out</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.539" end="00:31:34.890" style="s2">they do all these pushing metaphors and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.460" end="00:31:37.470" style="s2">then when the different turns they do I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.890" end="00:31:40.190" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve been drawn in I&#39;m carried</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.470" end="00:31:42.360" style="s2">along and they started and so they they</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.190" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">view the Buddhist metaphor thay they</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:46.020" style="s2">feel that they&#39;ve entered the stream</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">right that they&#39;ve found a way to orient</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.020" end="00:31:50.250" style="s2">themselves into the process so that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.929" style="s2">may now state to get carried along so</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.250" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">I&#39;m very I&#39;m very interested in that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.929" end="00:31:58.650" style="s2">trying to see what are the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">that make make that gel in take shape um</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.650" end="00:32:05.700" style="s2">actually starting to do work with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:09.299" style="s2">student about trying to maybe come up</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.700" end="00:32:11.070" style="s2">with you know a way of operationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.299" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">this and measuring this so we can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.070" end="00:32:14.809" style="s2">where you get that transition where it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.450" style="s2">goes from sort of chaotic to then</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.809" end="00:32:22.110" style="s2">coherent self-organization yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.450" end="00:32:23.669" style="s2">a real felt experience in that yes like</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.110" end="00:32:26.190" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.669" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">pushing versus a feeling of being drawn</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.190" end="00:32:30.690" style="s2">into it and exactly and you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.710" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like being in sort of a flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.690" end="00:32:36.690" style="s2">and there&#39;s more about harm a harmony of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:38.190" style="s2">the whole that kind of happens that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.690" end="00:32:40.500" style="s2">how do you kind of create that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.190" end="00:32:43.500" style="s2">environment yeah so so part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.500" end="00:32:46.049" style="s2">theorizing that I&#39;m doing is is that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.500" end="00:32:49.140" style="s2">think that what seems to be happening is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.049" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">that within distributed cognition you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.140" end="00:32:52.650" style="s2">getting you&#39;re getting a shared flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.820" end="00:32:54.330" style="s2">state in the trick set - in other words</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.650" end="00:32:56.549" style="s2">you&#39;re actually getting the you getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.330" end="00:32:59.789" style="s2">people in sort of distributed mutually</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.549" end="00:33:01.530" style="s2">reinforcing flow and so I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.789" end="00:33:04.049" style="s2">you know the conditions that create</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.530" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">individual flow how did that map onto</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.049" end="00:33:09.150" style="s2">you know creating this collective flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.150" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">in some circling events and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:18.690" style="s2">reading about it that the people often</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:20.850" style="s2">they they they get to do this like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.690" end="00:33:22.590" style="s2">third factor that in addition to all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.850" end="00:33:25.499" style="s2">people there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.590" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">or the process or even even the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.499" end="00:33:30.120" style="s2">and they start to feel sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:32.340" style="s2">relationship to the process and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">spirit of the process above and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.340" end="00:33:36.779" style="s2">but not excluding of the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">participants in the process and I get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.779" end="00:33:39.779" style="s2">sense from what you&#39;re just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:41.580" style="s2">that&#39;s also happening when you get into</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.779" end="00:33:43.470" style="s2">the deeper levels of empathy circling it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.580" end="00:33:45.659" style="s2">do people start to talk that way as if</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.470" end="00:33:48.029" style="s2">they&#39;re being sort of carried along and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.659" end="00:33:50.490" style="s2">the conversation itself is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.029" end="00:33:52.200" style="s2">direct them or lead them yeah I found</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.490" end="00:33:53.879" style="s2">there said there&#39;s a state where you</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.200" end="00:33:55.320" style="s2">don&#39;t even do empathic listening and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.879" end="00:33:58.379" style="s2">don&#39;t do the reflection anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.320" end="00:33:59.730" style="s2">like it&#39;s already embodied sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.379" end="00:34:01.799" style="s2">yeah we already know that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.730" end="00:34:03.809" style="s2">listening to each other right we already</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.799" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">know there&#39;s taking each other in so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.809" end="00:34:08.849" style="s2">don&#39;t even do the reflective listening</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">anymore and I kind of like that at state</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.849" end="00:34:13.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a shift that happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:16.470" style="s2">then I kind of feel I feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.409" end="00:34:20.460" style="s2">in at ease because I&#39;m not having to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.470" end="00:34:22.770" style="s2">on guard on guard about what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.460" end="00:34:24.990" style="s2">said is there gonna be space for me and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.770" end="00:34:26.369" style="s2">then I&#39;ve heard that so it is sort like</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.990" end="00:34:28.200" style="s2">this I&#39;ve some people have mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.369" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">sort of a third space you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.200" end="00:34:34.819" style="s2">yeah you in this third service space the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:37.349" style="s2">third space exactly happens and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.819" end="00:34:41.069" style="s2">recreate that and how do we deepen it</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.349" end="00:34:42.089" style="s2">yeah yeah III think that&#39;s those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.069" end="00:34:46.649" style="s2">good questions and those are questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.089" end="00:34:48.780" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get a handle on and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.649" end="00:34:51.240" style="s2">also interested in that because when</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.780" end="00:34:53.639" style="s2">people I&#39;ve seen and I&#39;ve read about and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.240" end="00:34:54.929" style="s2">I&#39;ve experienced that when people start</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.639" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">to get a sense of that third space</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.929" end="00:34:59.250" style="s2">they&#39;re there some of their they start</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.589" style="s2">to shift right and I want to be really</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.250" end="00:35:04.099" style="s2">careful here and I don&#39;t want it be I</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.589" end="00:35:06.780" style="s2">don&#39;t want this to be over read I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.099" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">but people they start to use spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.780" end="00:35:11.099" style="s2">and religious language and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.180" style="s2">this this space and it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.099" end="00:35:14.250" style="s2">because you&#39;re sort of involving the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.180" end="00:35:15.780" style="s2">whole self and then the whole self is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.250" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">relation to other people&#39;s whole selves</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.780" end="00:35:19.980" style="s2">and then all these whole selves are sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:24.890" style="s2">of in relation to this third space and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.980" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">it&#39;s see and I&#39;m interested in I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.890" end="00:35:30.569" style="s2">for lack of a better word the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">aspects of these practices too because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.569" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">think that&#39;s also the way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:36.460" style="s2">address the mean crisis they give people</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:38.890" style="s2">away of not believing</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.460" end="00:35:42.040" style="s2">propositions about spirituality but</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.890" end="00:35:44.500" style="s2">actually enacting the self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.040" end="00:35:46.540" style="s2">and the deep connectedness that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.500" end="00:35:48.760" style="s2">core of I think a lot of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.540" end="00:35:50.830" style="s2">and the cultivation of wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.760" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">spirituality to put an umbrella term on</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.830" end="00:35:53.020" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">I wonder what do you think about that do</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.020" end="00:35:56.710" style="s2">you think it starts to because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:35:58.869" style="s2">another aspect of addressing the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.710" end="00:36:00.790" style="s2">crisis right giving people a place like</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.869" end="00:36:03.700" style="s2">a temple or a church if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.790" end="00:36:07.390" style="s2">the analogy where they can go so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.700" end="00:36:09.430" style="s2">they can expand enact self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.390" end="00:36:12.099" style="s2">they can enact deep connectedness they</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.430" end="00:36:14.050" style="s2">can enact transformation they can enact</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.099" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">and awareness something more</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.050" end="00:36:19.030" style="s2">comprehensively connective than just</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">their own ego itself yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.030" end="00:36:24.580" style="s2">heard one of your your dialogues that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:40.210" style="s2">you had of a evangelical fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.580" end="00:36:41.950" style="s2">background yeah so yeah so I so for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.210" end="00:36:44.500" style="s2">you know I grew up I thought I knew</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.950" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">understood everything you know I go to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.500" end="00:36:48.910" style="s2">heaven I had the kind of the answers</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:52.599" style="s2">then I spent 10 years traveling around</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.910" end="00:36:55.420" style="s2">the world right Muslim countries Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.599" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">you know animist and just wide variety</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.420" end="00:37:00.250" style="s2">and all that kind of just you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:01.780" style="s2">of passed away to where I kind of I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.250" end="00:37:03.790" style="s2">saw that what people are kind of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.780" end="00:37:06.760" style="s2">if I was born here I&#39;d kind of be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.790" end="00:37:08.530" style="s2">Muslim if I was born here I&#39;d be a Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.760" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">or whatever just as I would have taken</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.530" end="00:37:13.589" style="s2">on like the culture and then I just saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">that the dose or this common humanity</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.589" end="00:37:19.109" style="s2">you know people just they&#39;re kind</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.109" end="00:37:25.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not so caring you know so so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:28.650" style="s2">just see it more spirituality as more</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">just felt experience so if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.650" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">spirituality that there is a felt</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:35.490" style="s2">experience of you know if you say</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:40.060" style="s2">transcendence something you know moving</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.490" end="00:37:41.770" style="s2">be unstuck getting unstuck yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.060" end="00:37:44.920" style="s2">what I like that&#39;s what I mean by self</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.770" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">transcendence and I mean again again if</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.920" end="00:37:49.540" style="s2">we if like I think what&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:50.170" style="s2">people I felt experience of getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.540" end="00:37:51.640" style="s2">unstuck</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.170" end="00:37:54.280" style="s2">also a felt experience of making</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.640" end="00:37:55.930" style="s2">connections and making meaning and again</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.280" end="00:37:57.580" style="s2">not propositional meaning I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.930" end="00:37:59.260" style="s2">meaning in life kind of meaning the kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.580" end="00:38:01.810" style="s2">of where we sense that we&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.260" end="00:38:03.940" style="s2">very deeply to ourselves to other people</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.810" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">to reality in important ways the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.940" end="00:38:07.390" style="s2">you know that the research is showing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:09.130" style="s2">you know are really conducive to people</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.390" end="00:38:11.560" style="s2">feeling they have a lot of meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.130" end="00:38:14.890" style="s2">life and that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.560" end="00:38:17.230" style="s2">spirituality yeah so for me I just used</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.890" end="00:38:20.200" style="s2">the word felt experience to be as</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.230" end="00:38:22.420" style="s2">spirituality somehow has a sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.200" end="00:38:24.430" style="s2">being another world I mean yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.420" end="00:38:27.250" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not a part of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.430" end="00:38:29.110" style="s2">experience or something like God who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.250" end="00:38:33.640" style="s2">in a different dimension that&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.110" end="00:38:35.710" style="s2">of the this yeah I I understand your</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.640" end="00:38:38.980" style="s2">criticism and as you know I think we</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.710" end="00:38:40.780" style="s2">have to I I sometimes would use the word</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.980" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">Sapienza rather than spiritual meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.780" end="00:38:45.310" style="s2">nothing to do with wisdom in this broad</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:48.280" style="s2">sense of really understanding you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.310" end="00:38:49.540" style="s2">how to connect with other people with</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.280" end="00:38:52.870" style="s2">yourself and other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.540" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">and really cultivate a depth in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.870" end="00:38:58.150" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:59.830" style="s2">yeah something oh sorry go ahead I just</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.150" end="00:39:01.150" style="s2">want I just wanted to just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.830" end="00:39:02.740" style="s2">thank you for letting me finish I</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.150" end="00:39:05.650" style="s2">appreciate that I just wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.740" end="00:39:08.020" style="s2">that I guess part of the way I see the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.650" end="00:39:11.290" style="s2">project that I&#39;ve been engaging is is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.020" end="00:39:14.050" style="s2">try and reconstruct the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.290" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">spirituality make it more oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.050" end="00:39:17.950" style="s2">SAP because I want to take it out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.810" style="s2">that two worlds grammar that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.950" end="00:39:21.670" style="s2">pointed to because many people I like</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.810" end="00:39:23.350" style="s2">you they don&#39;t find that two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.670" end="00:39:26.050" style="s2">grammar of the here and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.350" end="00:39:28.570" style="s2">other world of Heaven or God they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.050" end="00:39:30.670" style="s2">find that two worlds grammar viable</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.570" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s not a live option for them</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.670" end="00:39:34.330" style="s2">and if spirituality is bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s why that&#39;s why you I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.330" end="00:39:37.540" style="s2">argue that&#39;s what you see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:39.160" style="s2">people rejecting the established</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.540" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">religions because that grammar doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.160" end="00:39:43.090" style="s2">work for them anymore for all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:46.120" style="s2">historical and I think scientific</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.090" end="00:39:47.560" style="s2">reasons but if can we take whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.120" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">was that was going on there that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.560" end="00:39:51.580" style="s2">afforded people what I call religio that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">deep sense of connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.580" end="00:39:56.200" style="s2">affordance of getting unstuck self</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2">transcendence growth in meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.200" end="00:40:02.020" style="s2">it can we bring it into another way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:03.170" style="s2">thinking that doesn&#39;t rely on the two</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.020" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">world grammar</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.170" end="00:40:06.530" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to point</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.119" style="s2">to I think that part of what empathy</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.530" end="00:40:10.250" style="s2">circling and these other modalities are</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.119" end="00:40:12.170" style="s2">doing is exactly that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.250" end="00:40:14.809" style="s2">say we don&#39;t need that we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.170" end="00:40:18.740" style="s2">that that that myth us anymore there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.809" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">another way in which we can enact these</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.740" end="00:40:24.770" style="s2">these X what you call the felt the felt</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.299" style="s2">experience of connectedness yeah how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.770" end="00:40:28.430" style="s2">you create that sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.299" end="00:40:33.640" style="s2">without having to think of God and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.430" end="00:40:36.290" style="s2">some outside worldly sort of space other</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.640" end="00:40:38.569" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what Carl Rogers if</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.290" end="00:40:40.700" style="s2">you you know if like that paper of his</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.569" end="00:40:42.680" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of addressing this like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.700" end="00:40:44.900" style="s2">talking about people getting stuck I</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.680" end="00:40:48.130" style="s2">mean whose whole work was like people</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.900" end="00:40:50.920" style="s2">are coming I am stuck in I&#39;m stuck in in</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.130" end="00:40:54.440" style="s2">disconnection alienation depression</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.920" end="00:40:56.599" style="s2">anxiety fear I mean just go down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.440" end="00:40:59.630" style="s2">list of all these feelings that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.599" end="00:41:02.869" style="s2">get sort of stuck in and he&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.630" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">just through the listening to people for</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.869" end="00:41:08.450" style="s2">them to start opening up start sharing</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:11.059" style="s2">their felt experience and for that to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.450" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">seen it are something about the having</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.059" end="00:41:14.390" style="s2">someone there to reflect you to be sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:16.819" style="s2">of on the journey with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.390" end="00:41:19.549" style="s2">metaphorically I&#39;m on the journey with</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.819" end="00:41:20.829" style="s2">you to follow you on your journey and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.549" end="00:41:22.970" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.829" end="00:41:26.210" style="s2">companionship that creates a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.970" end="00:41:28.819" style="s2">connection even in the darkest you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.210" end="00:41:31.190" style="s2">you see people who just collapse like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.819" end="00:41:32.660" style="s2">just they collapse with grief or</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.190" end="00:41:35.480" style="s2">whatever and there&#39;s someone there that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.660" end="00:41:37.910" style="s2">has their arms around that person sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.480" end="00:41:42.500" style="s2">of being present with them and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.910" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">support in that that moment so it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.500" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">think that&#39;s sort of the the empathic</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:50.930" style="s2">presence that how it helps the unstuck</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:53.150" style="s2">did it&#39;s like as you slowly go in and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.930" end="00:41:57.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve had that experience I don&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.150" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">before but with I was kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.260" end="00:42:02.630" style="s2">nursing my own anxiety and and I was in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:04.220" style="s2">a dance I do freestyle dance right so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.630" end="00:42:06.559" style="s2">was noticing it and I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.220" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">instead of just avoiding it going off in</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.559" end="00:42:11.750" style="s2">a way I&#39;m gonna really try to tap in I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:13.849" style="s2">gonna try to take that anxiety that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.750" end="00:42:17.029" style="s2">feel kind of in the core of my body and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.849" end="00:42:19.489" style="s2">I want to zoom in on it like like</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.029" end="00:42:22.309" style="s2">picture like when you zoom into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.489" end="00:42:24.169" style="s2">picture you get individual pixels I said</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.309" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2">I want to zoom into this and get into</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.169" end="00:42:30.469" style="s2">the individual pixels and see what it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.390" end="00:42:32.989" style="s2">and and ice and as I did that I started</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.469" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">getting metaphors came to my like oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.989" end="00:42:37.369" style="s2">it&#39;s like thousands of little knives</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.929" style="s2">that are cutting away slicing away it</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.369" end="00:42:41.479" style="s2">mean I&#39;m gonna get really close to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.929" end="00:42:45.109" style="s2">and as I got really I kept you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.479" end="00:42:47.419" style="s2">of exploring it kind of dissolved that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.109" end="00:42:50.179" style="s2">feeling dissolved in a new and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.419" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">like oh this is kind of it&#39;s gone and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.179" end="00:42:54.559" style="s2">then it was only a few seconds later</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:57.049" style="s2">that oh I have another one there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.559" end="00:42:59.150" style="s2">this heaviness in my mind kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.049" end="00:43:00.679" style="s2">heavy cloud so I was kind of met it turn</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.150" end="00:43:03.439" style="s2">it and then I started going into that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.679" end="00:43:07.099" style="s2">and for like an hour I just kind of kept</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.439" end="00:43:09.949" style="s2">dancing into looking for the fears and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.099" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">anxieties and I would kind of get as</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.949" end="00:43:13.309" style="s2">close as I could and and it&#39;s like going</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:16.489" style="s2">into him it&#39;s like they would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.309" end="00:43:19.819" style="s2">open up and sort of dissolve and at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.489" end="00:43:22.279" style="s2">end of an hour I felt like I was I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.819" end="00:43:25.789" style="s2">I was like in heaven it was like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.279" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">was just so calm I was just so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.789" end="00:43:34.369" style="s2">ah this space of just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:37.400" style="s2">transcendence like it just felt so good</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.369" end="00:43:40.549" style="s2">to have kind of trans it train gone</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.400" end="00:43:42.559" style="s2">through all of these these fears I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.549" end="00:43:45.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what a depression pastic presence</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.559" end="00:43:48.229" style="s2">does it allows you that&#39;s that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.199" end="00:43:51.589" style="s2">not going alone on that journey into</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.229" end="00:43:53.749" style="s2">these different feelings so I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.589" end="00:43:55.729" style="s2">tying that in with the spirituality for</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.749" end="00:43:59.709" style="s2">me that no totally liked all the totally</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.729" end="00:44:02.119" style="s2">a spiritual transit formative trend yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.709" end="00:44:03.979" style="s2">that&#39;s good because I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.119" end="00:44:05.989" style="s2">both an individual you might call it a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.979" end="00:44:07.339" style="s2">therapeutic aspect of meeting crisis but</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.989" end="00:44:09.409" style="s2">I think there&#39;s also a cultural aspect</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.339" end="00:44:10.939" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.409" end="00:44:12.949" style="s2">with this notion of spirituality we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.939" end="00:44:15.109" style="s2">a better term but we need something yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.949" end="00:44:16.939" style="s2">people need sort of individual ways of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.109" end="00:44:18.709" style="s2">getting unstuck but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.939" end="00:44:20.539" style="s2">people also have a sense of being sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.709" end="00:44:22.909" style="s2">of culture shock experience and culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.539" end="00:44:24.529" style="s2">shock within this culture like not</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.909" end="00:44:27.019" style="s2">feeling at home in the culture at large</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.529" end="00:44:28.699" style="s2">a kind of collective domicile and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.019" end="00:44:30.860" style="s2">think part of that is they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.699" end="00:44:32.990" style="s2">for I mean I think there&#39;s evidence</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.860" end="00:44:35.090" style="s2">or this they&#39;re looking for ways not</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.990" end="00:44:36.820" style="s2">because they&#39;re in what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.090" end="00:44:39.350" style="s2">it you know any kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.820" end="00:44:40.940" style="s2">distress this is much more an</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.350" end="00:44:43.850" style="s2">existential they&#39;re looking for ways to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.940" end="00:44:45.620" style="s2">afford this connection and I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.850" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">your intent right yeah bethey isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.620" end="00:44:48.380" style="s2">for people who are in therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:50.470" style="s2">distressed it&#39;s supposed to be also</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.380" end="00:44:52.910" style="s2">something that&#39;s more existentially</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.470" end="00:44:54.470" style="s2">powerful and relevant is that is that oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.910" end="00:44:58.070" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m looking for cultural</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.470" end="00:45:00.350" style="s2">transformation my idea is that if we and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.070" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">is this is just one tool the empathy</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.350" end="00:45:04.670" style="s2">circle is something that can be trans</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:06.710" style="s2">you know can go into the full culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.670" end="00:45:08.030" style="s2">and I really am serious about you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.710" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">what I want to do I&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.030" end="00:45:11.210" style="s2">the extinction rubella near the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:13.850" style="s2">environmental because I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.210" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">nonviolent direct action I&#39;m wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.850" end="00:45:19.700" style="s2">do empathic direct action where we like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:21.140" style="s2">set up our empathy and all these empathy</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.700" end="00:45:23.540" style="s2">tents we&#39;ve got them in different</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.540" end="00:45:29.050" style="s2">Mall you know in front of the Congress</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:31.370" style="s2">and we say we demand that the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.050" end="00:45:34.790" style="s2">Republicans and Democrats do empathy</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.370" end="00:45:37.810" style="s2">circles with each other and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.790" end="00:45:40.070" style="s2">that&#39;s great so the way I see it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.810" end="00:45:41.960" style="s2">metaphorically is it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.070" end="00:45:46.310" style="s2">World War one right you got the social</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.960" end="00:45:50.770" style="s2">structure which is you know is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.310" end="00:45:53.510" style="s2">authoritarian colonial a real automatic</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.770" end="00:45:56.270" style="s2">hierarchical structure you got the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.510" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2">soldiers working with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.270" end="00:46:00.140" style="s2">then you got the nurses and doctors</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:02.440" style="s2">trying to help like oh that&#39;s great but</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.140" end="00:46:05.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not those nurses and doctors aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">transforming the overall a social</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.000" end="00:46:09.620" style="s2">structure so it&#39;s like how do we take</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">this sort of mindset and bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.620" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">the core of the social structure II of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">the political social structures and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.340" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">we camp out you know there on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:23.180" style="s2">Capitol Mall and we got these empathy</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:26.510" style="s2">tents on if you&#39;ve seen the tents that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.180" end="00:46:27.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we oh I have to send you the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.510" end="00:46:30.590" style="s2">links please</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.560" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">so we we you know the political right</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.590" end="00:46:35.060" style="s2">comes to Berkeley and then the political</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:38.330" style="s2">left and Tifa and so forth you know come</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.060" end="00:46:40.250" style="s2">and they kind of battle it out here and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.330" end="00:46:42.140" style="s2">we have this you know small group we</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.250" end="00:46:43.370" style="s2">have an empathy tent we set it up kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.140" end="00:46:44.080" style="s2">of in the middle of that we offer</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.370" end="00:46:46.750" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.080" end="00:46:49.120" style="s2">to both sides and also sort of mediation</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.750" end="00:46:51.400" style="s2">between the sides so we&#39;ve got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.120" end="00:46:54.670" style="s2">machinery either cool for setting this</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.400" end="00:46:56.740" style="s2">up and so we got the tools so I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.670" end="00:47:00.550" style="s2">of working towards that you know capital</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.740" end="00:47:03.790" style="s2">mall that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.550" end="00:47:05.710" style="s2">so that that goes towards like my my</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.790" end="00:47:08.440" style="s2">concern about the sort of zappy ntral</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.710" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">spiritual aspects of this about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.440" end="00:47:12.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a therapeutic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:15.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.570" end="00:47:16.540" style="s2">existential and cultural transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.310" end="00:47:18.190" style="s2">that you&#39;re seeking so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.540" end="00:47:19.990" style="s2">answered that question very well I also</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.190" end="00:47:22.270" style="s2">see in the way you were describing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.990" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">dancing and I mean this is also again</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.270" end="00:47:26.260" style="s2">one&#39;s work right there there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:27.940" style="s2">training in mindfulness could interact</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.260" end="00:47:29.590" style="s2">with things like the empathy circling</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.940" end="00:47:31.510" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t you chilli improve and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.590" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">benefit each other and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.510" end="00:47:35.860" style="s2">very powerful ways so like you know in</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.780" style="s2">other ways I&#39;m trying to unseeing how</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.860" end="00:47:40.450" style="s2">empathy circling could fit into a larger</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.780" end="00:47:42.040" style="s2">ecology of practices so that example was</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.450" end="00:47:43.900" style="s2">particularly helpful to me so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.040" end="00:47:45.220" style="s2">yeah it is thinking but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.900" end="00:47:47.830" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to usually try and do</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.220" end="00:47:50.950" style="s2">cultural transformation and create the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.830" end="00:47:53.350" style="s2">tool set in a map for how can this</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.950" end="00:47:56.050" style="s2">cultural transformation take part is</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.350" end="00:47:58.510" style="s2">kind of what I&#39;m getting is that culture</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.050" end="00:48:02.050" style="s2">the culture itself the whole dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.510" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">the the mutuality is that is having that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.050" end="00:48:07.150" style="s2">crisis of yes where do we go from here</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:10.270" style="s2">things are falling apart there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.150" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">polarization you know we&#39;re not solving</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.270" end="00:48:16.330" style="s2">climate crisis etc etc yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:18.820" style="s2">eggs right so we&#39;re not only stuck as</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.820" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">culture in an important way and so and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">want to understand</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.780" end="00:48:32.350" style="s2">individual level of practice and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.370" end="00:48:33.490" style="s2">more comprehensive level and I see what</p>
