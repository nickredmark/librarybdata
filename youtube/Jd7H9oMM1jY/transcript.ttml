<p begin="00:00:00.480" end="00:00:05.120" style="s2">um yeah so i i guess to anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.000" end="00:00:08.480" style="s2">ends up watching this</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.120" end="00:00:10.400" style="s2">i wanted to have a chat with jubilee um</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:11.599" style="s2">about the idea of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.400" end="00:00:14.799" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.599" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">um having spent</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.799" end="00:00:18.560" style="s2">a good amount of time the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2">weeks um actually digging into anarchy</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.560" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">and some of the the thoughts in there</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.800" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">and over time</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:26.080" style="s2">in the game space i&#39;ve come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">or suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.080" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">maybe even some of the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">discussions may come out of that space</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">because i see</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:38.320" style="s2">overlap not that it necessarily has to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">um and then uh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">going into anarchy which is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">that i think most of us are raised to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:46.719" style="s2">think is crazy talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">um and also uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">from game b type people knowing some</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">smart people were actually anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">um caused me to give it another look</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">and then come to the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">anarchy itself the actual theory and at</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">least the same people</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">that follow it um there is logic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">reason behind it</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">and i even have learned um that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">what i&#39;ve always been about i guess i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">always sort of fought</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">for some things that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">anarchy in theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i&#39;d call myself an</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">anarchist but um</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">yeah i think a lot of the stuff there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">some good ideals to at least have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">in mind to aim towards that said i do</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">run into</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">uh some challenges uh depending on who</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">i guess the purists i run into but</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the same as any</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">uh ideology who are hung up let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">on any kind of power relationship or any</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">kind of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">which then gets me into a spot and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">think most people of well how could you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">do anything because every relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">some kind of dynamic which then led me</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">i think jubilee had told me in passing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">on a call once that she was i believe in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">honor kiss i think you do you identify</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">jubilee or um yes and no i&#39;ve had other</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">people label me as anarchism and much</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">what&#39;s that happening enough i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">was like okay i&#39;ll look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">there&#39;s things i agree with and things i</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:13.239" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with for sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">i find my i myself am very</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.239" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">anti-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">but not for the sake of it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you have to just be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">like there&#39;s no hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">it&#39;s more voluntary hierarchy like i</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna position over me</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t agree to be in a position</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">of authority over me</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">and very brief you know like i&#39;ll sue</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">chef for somebody else who&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">chef</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">no problem i&#39;ll follow your orders but</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">perpetual slavery or not even under</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">government doctors and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">i go with the no the gnome uh from</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">saying his name gnome</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">kromsky um chomsky yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">um you know that kind of unjustified</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">hierarchy so it&#39;s like you know having</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">the mind to hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">not having overloads just for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">of it which i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">would probably be okay with except for</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">overlords um</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">that makes sense to me so i think it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">creates that space to constantly have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">are like hey should i follow these</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">people and should i</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">actually be sitting in a position where</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">i&#39;m dictating things maybe i need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">realize hey that time has passed let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">kind of go back down into the the group</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">um so i think that&#39;s a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">frame to kind of always have around um</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">yeah so i think i&#39;ve always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">operated that way on my own naturally</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">um but you know i&#39;m not triggered by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">fact that jubilee has control of the mic</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">because she runs this uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">this the stream cast so i am okay with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">little bit of those power you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">inevitably gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">so i do get into some i&#39;ve been on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">anarchy reddit</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">um for the past two weeks so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">an interesting test</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">of myself so but it&#39;s been good um</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">so what i really wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">jubilee about though was the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">sovereignty um which i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">you know i have no issues with it um in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">um but i think that&#39;s where i struggle</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">at times</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">i do find even sometimes maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">game b space but i think more externally</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">i run into people that use it almost as</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">a bypass for any accountability and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">is something that i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">not just about sovereignty but um or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">the way we use it but i i realize that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">something i get triggered on</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">quite a bit on all of the kind of tough</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">we go on is when somebody yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">because i tend to i guess be a person</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">that uh is trying to be active and find</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">solutions you know i&#39;ll raise</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">problems but i raise them with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">effort of trying to find solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">and i do have a strong expectation that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">of myself to first be respectful of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">but i expect i want the same thing back</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">and i really struggle</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">i&#39;ll try to make the example first but</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">then i struggle with people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">get to use something like sovereignty or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">another and the other in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">communities another word i learned this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">week was spiritual bypassing so</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">basically when people find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">never have accountability</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">um so yeah i wanted to explore that with</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">you and your thoughts and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">referencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">the the call uh you helped me through</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">actually the guidance you gave me about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">a month ago when i got into it a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">bit with uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">another fellow game b person that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">saying things that i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">did not agree with and found a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">bit ignorant and offensive</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">so um but you know you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">i think that the point you had made to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">me was you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">you choose who you engage with um or how</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna react</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember exactly how it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">framed and it was valid</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t triggered by you per se</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">cause basically i trust that you would</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">reasonable conversation with me but i do</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">struggle with that edge and it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">from the way it seemed to me your</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">position would be okay well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">make somebody and i can understand that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">in a way but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">it almost if i can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">entering a space that both of us are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">going to hold ourselves accountable</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">to respecting each other and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">see that good faith i guess rule omega</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">um to me i have a really hard time</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">wondering well how can i stick around</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">those spaces because</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.280" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">to me there&#39;s a point when i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">choose like you know if i give so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">of myself and somebody can just crap all</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">over me</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">and the community allows that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">yeah like i know i can choose but at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">same time should i have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">in all circumstances so yeah i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">yeah what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">kind of where i&#39;m going there right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">yeah even the word sovereignty triggers</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">a lot of the time i had to look up i had</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">to look up a definition of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think it matters what</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">google&#39;s definition is of it but what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">your definition of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">like what do you mean when you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">sovereignty yeah so i guess the way i</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">would have always looked at it before</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">is um like i hadn&#39;t used it or you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">in any kind of meaningful way until</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">getting into the game b i guess space</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">um you know definitely accountability um</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">independence but more in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">you know i grew up in as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">about you know the rural farming lands</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">of saskatchewan and it&#39;s a very pull</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">your bootstraps up you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">mentality so definitely a hard a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">pressure on you where basically no</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">matter what&#39;s happening to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">if everything&#39;s on your shoulders so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">almost don&#39;t even get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">point out your circumstances which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">healthy and i&#39;m not advocating that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">definitely i come into things</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">first expecting and i&#39;m okay with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">at least for myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">really pushing on myself hard is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">can i do what&#39;s in my control</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">and i actually have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:51.120" style="s2">accepting what&#39;s not in my control</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">because i&#39;m worried that i&#39;m giving a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.120" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">cop out so i really push to extremes on</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">as to am i missing something is there</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">something i should be doing better here</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">um so but i also don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">that back from everybody else to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">degree because i actually think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">bit crazy if i</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">was to project it onto somebody else i</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know you can expect things of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">ourselves we won&#39;t have others but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">um yeah i guess it&#39;s just you know if i</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">impact somebody and they&#39;re upset it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter why they&#39;re upset</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">if i wouldn&#39;t have gotten upset or</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">whatever that they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">so to me respect is to listen learn and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">at least show that i care</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">and i will change whatever&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">so that we can work together so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">know if that&#39;s a good definition but i</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">think it gives you a feel for</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">what i spin around in that idea yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:45.399" style="s2">i think me</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">for me sovereignty is very tied with</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.399" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">self-sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">and before having this conversation i</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">was like okay yeah i can see why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">triggering for me because i feel like i</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">be self-sufficient no matter what like</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">my health just doesn&#39;t allow me to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">self-sufficient but it does allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">be sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">and that like being able to tease those</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">two apart and being like okay i know i</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">can&#39;t garden</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">and like do the things i would need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">be able to look after myself and my</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">family all on my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">and yet i can work in a group to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">that done</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">and i can and i demand sovereignty over</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">my own life like i can&#39;t have anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">else have to have that position</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">and um i just feel like it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">mention that like i</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">although i yes of an anarchist basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">because the label was given to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">the one place where i&#39;m like beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">communist anarchy i&#39;m an ancon yes but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">but then whenever i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">in the anarchist spaces especially the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">and come versus end cap spaces</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">i&#39;m like oh you people can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">anarchism you guys can&#39;t even like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">talk to it like it&#39;s the irony of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">the very people who want it or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">people who i think are least capable of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">being able to follow through on it in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">absolutely yeah um yeah there&#39;s a people</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">and i guess as you know anyways maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">anybody watching will not but um you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">know having done some experiments</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">having created a co-living startup of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">the last four years and i guess didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">realize it in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">different grassroots type anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">ideas trying to really</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">those things this goes into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">different stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">point being what i ran into is i really</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">should to me it was important hey if i</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">you know in my team when i did have</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">because everything kind of crashed but</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">um was nobody should have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">we should be i try to make sure that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">understanding the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">position i&#39;m fighting for them before</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">they even feel they have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">so really trying to understand like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">what is their situation what might they</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">feel what would they normally</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">think is going on in this situation like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">if there&#39;s a dynamic where</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s going to be a clash or</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">i have needs but they also have needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">that you know to make sure that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">pushing for my needs respecting as much</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">or understanding as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">what needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">do they have and what would their</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">arguments be for them or</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">against having to compromise for mine</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">because i i know how horrible it is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">show up in a room</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">and have people that pretend that your</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">needs don&#39;t exist so i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">sensitive to that but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">that&#39;s how i showed up to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">people and they tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">you know the community they tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">people that i guess some of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">probably come from the anarchist stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">as i&#39;ve started to research more i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">recognizing where some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">ideas i ran into must have been rooted</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">at least some</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">at some times um you know post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">gets in there and many other</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">areas but um yeah i what they would do</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">is take from me they talked about all</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">these great ideals</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">but it was basically like those were</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">good ideas to expect of me</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">in infinity but never</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">provide back to me like we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">equals and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">that so i&#39;m i&#39;m actually very scared of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">that like i&#39;m triggered when i run into</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">that because yeah i want to create this</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">world we&#39;re all talking about so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">drawn into these groups because i hear</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">this positive ideas i believe in</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">at least trying to get as close as</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">but then i&#39;m also now struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">feeling like those people that talk like</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">that are the most dangerous people i</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">have ever met so i i know that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">absolute and always true but um</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s really trying to explore</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">what your thoughts were i think you had</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">mentioned about</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">the community that you were in once and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">i think you mentioned a similar dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">um and i yeah i just don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">really navigate that or get out of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">trap</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">or is there a filter you do</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">i mean i really do just try to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:14.600" style="s2">hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">sovereign without it dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.600" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">self-sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">be like okay what can i do here what can</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">i learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">um there is a uncomfortableness</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">with the more evolved i get the more the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">expects of me and the least it looks at</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">me like</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the irony of like okay well if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">are capable of that right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">capable of looking after somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">needs before they&#39;ve ever spoken them</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">then they expect that of you which means</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">that then and they&#39;re not giving it back</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like everything&#39;s on your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">and you&#39;re given no respect for it right</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">because you&#39;re not seen as</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">as being in a position of authority or a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">of being a better human being you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">just capable of that you&#39;re expected to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">give it and that&#39;s your your normal so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">like i couldn&#39;t possibly give that back</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh and the the like it comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">up a lot in the neurodiversity space</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">of people like expecting autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">to ask and expecting autistic people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">change their mindset and doing all and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">i&#39;m like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">if our autism stop keeps us very rigid</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">and stops us from doing those things</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">but your neurotypical brain doesn&#39;t why</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t you changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">why aren&#39;t you the one who changes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be easier</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s supposed to be easier for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">and yet that&#39;s never gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s all not like frankly the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">neurotypical people can&#39;t handle that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">they could like</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">they&#39;re so used to life working for them</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">that they can&#39;t handle changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">it becomes depression to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">equal or given equal burden you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">as you hear in and i guess most commonly</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">now in the racial debate right you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">for a white person that&#39;s never had to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">consider or change how they do things</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">to and think of take a burden of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">thinking of somebody else&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">um equality feels like oppression right</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s the same dynamic so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">yeah i definitely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">at least in my experience even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">than that that the people we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">hold in positions of privilege</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">are the exact opposite of what we see</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">them to be like i did this youtube video</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">a few months</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">it might have been six months ago at</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">this point called um like i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">about privilege and how i think that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">talk about it in a very weird way where</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a man bodhi so you better</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">give me some of that privilege right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not transferable you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">transfer it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">and so it feels like we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">going around i&#39;m not begging for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">privilege</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">when you can&#39;t transfer it when really</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like actually i think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">easy to see</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">you know they were hurting and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">struggling i&#39;m not gonna keep attacking</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">because a lot of times it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">easy for those people or</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">we become monsters very easy especially</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">explain and understand where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">coming from and try to inform people</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">but it yeah there&#39;s a point when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">like hey at what point do i get to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">at least it isn&#39;t right that you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">understand um but you&#39;re coming at me</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">like you&#39;re absolutely certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">that i&#39;m somebody that you deserve to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">attack right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">because i&#39;ve put my foot because really</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">what happens is you&#39;re so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">experienced this it&#39;s like you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">good and accommodating for so long and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">then finally when you say no</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">this is enough to people that are used</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">to you always helping them they take it</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">almost as an attack</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">where for you it&#39;s just like literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">i&#39;ll die if i keep giving you more of</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">um so it&#39;s really difficult and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re in a community</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">environment you know of course it</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">next time and just being smarter of who</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">i let in and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">um not trying to make anybody bad up</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">front but just realizing like i need</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">to the the reason i jumped in talking is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">in these anarchy groups i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">have ran into some really great</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">reasonable people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">give me the pathway try to see where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">at and are actually people probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">working on the anarchist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">with a chance of actually creating a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">future as opposed to many of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">it&#39;s again it&#39;s not anarchy but it&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s unfortunately a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">humanity you know whether they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">capitalist or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">who knows what they hang on to one</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">myopic point like you know there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.280" style="s2">pull yourself up by the bootstraps</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">mentality that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.280" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">necessarily bad like you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">accountable to be sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">but there are obvious limits like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">know and if you can&#39;t have a rational</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">to say these are the circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">you know like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know just lack of a better you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">know some reason a wheelchair actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">let&#39;s go to something a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">just like a race you know if somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">always starting the race</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">five miles ahead of the other person and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">the person that&#39;s five miles behind</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">always gets judged for being such a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">loser for not winning against the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">person why don&#39;t you just work hard by</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">like sam or whoever</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">like we of course know that makes no</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">sense but you get into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">different ideological spaces nobody will</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s all innately yeah so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">maybe okay so if i sort of paint that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">but going back to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">sovereignty i guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering am i miss trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">out where this line is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to check myself to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">sure i&#39;m not being blind to something i</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">because there is a point when i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">yes it&#39;s like no i should put my foot</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">down and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t compare me against sam he</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">started five miles ahead of me</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">every time like this isn&#39;t a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">of my speed</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s faster than me but the truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">is we just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">and quit judging me uh so</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s you can paint that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">line but then when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">dynamics like sovereignty and just talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">in the game b space and you&#39;ve seen some</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">things i&#39;ve struggled with just in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">different dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">trying to understand or even from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">community perspective so let&#39;s say from</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">not that we&#39;re gonna answer this right</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">now but you know eventually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">realizing hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">as a group of people and what we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">sovereignty is and what we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">is on all of us to take where is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">point when we as a community also want</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">to help hold a bar</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s like hey you know what this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.960" style="s2">you know right now it&#39;s fine if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.960" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">but you need to accept that at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something for you to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">in your end at least respect that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not all on body kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">thing like you know he&#39;s coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">valid place too</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">so and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">i think yeah so i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">expect you to give me that perfect line</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">it&#39;s really circumstantial but</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">um i think as you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">you know even in our tacoma during that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s always i want to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">i want to get righteous and be mad and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">stand up for myself but it&#39;s like trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">to sit it&#39;s like hey like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">what are my blind spots here so</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">how do you define because sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">isn&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t just walk away like you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">the truth is we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">we&#39;re living the world together there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">you know at a point</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">other people&#39;s personal choices and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">does impact another person you know and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">it depends on so many</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">you know we do have there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">power dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">at what point is it acceptable for me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">be like oh i have to figure this out i</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">positions for that right when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">meta learning magic or my omega group or</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">tech there&#39;s going to be tension and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">need to figure it out and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">we&#39;re choosing to be a group right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">we&#39;re figuring it we&#39;ll figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">but there&#39;s a big difference between me</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">demanding that right like demanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">everyone who showed up to week one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">of mlm like no no you have to continue</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">for six weeks right that was the deal</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">going to continue for six weeks life</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">comes up stuff happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t get to control anyone else i get</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">to control and i can&#39;t even control that</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s real my world view is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">everything happens for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s shown itself to me the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">conversation at the right time at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">right and so i wouldn&#39;t put that on</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">i mean when i look at them the two</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">circumstances that happen in the last</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">couple years for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">one with my neighbor one with my sister</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">clearly not objective but looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">i&#39;m like there&#39;s literally nothing i did</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">wrong here</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">with my sister there was a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">previous stuff of like oh i let our</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">dynamic be this i let you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">mean but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">in this instance there&#39;s nothing i could</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">have done differently it was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">what&#39;s supposed to happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.080" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">for my learning to come out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">the one with my you know neighbor who</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">yelled at me and i&#39;m like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">nothing what would</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">not have feet not walk on the floor like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing i could have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">besides maybe you know not knew she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">like that and not go and talk to her at</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">that time period or that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s hindsight but i didn&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">her get away with it i was</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">like to a point i was the one person was</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">like we need to deal with this with</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">conflict resolution we need to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">this through</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">process and the the community itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">kind of dealt with it horribly</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s like right that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">community right like it&#39;s like if this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">is how you want to let people treat each</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">other if you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">and yet i understand she&#39;s a homeowner</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">what do you do is she gonna be there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">be talk like</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">you won&#39;t want to create all that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">conflict but sweeping it under the rug</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">creates</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">deeper and deeper conflict is anyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">living in an intention</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like but for me i just got</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">my learning out of it i don&#39;t need her</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">to learn i don&#39;t need her to grow in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">fact when she did it a second time and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">laughed at her unfortunately she was</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">like i don&#39;t like to be laughed at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">was like well</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">i really don&#39;t know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s in their 70s and asking</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">me to control my seven-year-old</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">except</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">laugh and then you know she kept kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">trying to come and i was like listen i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t mean allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">walk all over you but it also like</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">i kind of have pulled myself out of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">community not because of that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">the pandemic incovid but having</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">i was like no she&#39;s not allowed to talk</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">and it turns out i didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">there was this whole other part of game</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">theory that&#39;s based on cooperative games</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">because they only came out the last ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">years and so he introduced me to that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">was like oh cool</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">um and which i was glad for a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">but there was a lot of times where i was</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">putting in not emotional labor but</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">intellectual labor right and like</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">explaining</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">a resource-based economy and explaining</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">these things and the person just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">want to understand or they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not really on me to pick between</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">those two it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to but like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">let&#39;s say for me it&#39;s like okay if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">are being good faith and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to because yeah you know to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">walk away from somebody especially if</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">you know of course there&#39;s times we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">maybe have to make that choice but i</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">at least am very resonant to to want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">make i don&#39;t want to abandon somebody</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">so that sets me up for a dynamic where i</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">can you know if somebody is being</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">frankly a piece of like that is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">difficult dynamic and you can get abused</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">pretty easily in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">um so</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">hasn&#39;t evolved since</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">since i encountered it and it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">economics and on</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">and changing prices based on how much</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">you make per hour</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m like the economics doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">sense he&#39;s like but amazon prime gives a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">discount i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">yeah but they don&#39;t charge rich people</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">more and they also are losing on all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">who like posted this point and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">your demand curve i&#39;m like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">demand there&#39;s no supply curve only a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">demand curve he&#39;s like no you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">the demand curve is flat and i was like</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">oh sorry the supply i was like supply</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">curve can&#39;t be flat like literally and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">then he posted this other thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">really informative of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">how you actually can do the entire area</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">under the curve for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">for the demand curve but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">based on monopoly based on this and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">flat demand curve is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">supply curve is the exact opposite and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">i&#39;m like okay do i continue</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">do i point this out to him no because</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">he&#39;s not going to hear it for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">he really don&#39;t mean i&#39;m like listen i</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">understand economics you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">but maybe maybe he does and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">deeper but like watching the thing he</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">sent me i was like do you not see</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">that you&#39;re simultaneously needing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">to be a monopoly and a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">competitive system this is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">competitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">this is a monopoly you don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">choice in any of it and that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">you change the price people are just</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">gonna go choose somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">yet he&#39;s so dog with a bone like this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">the solution he puts so much time and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">much energy into it and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">use your time and energy anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">this project is broken</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">well just the same type of life like</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like i had the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">inauguration in history it&#39;s like uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">everybody has pictures</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">but like you know those things are just</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">like oh like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">but so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s tough i guess</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">i wonder if like i think where i</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">and again why i thought of talking to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">you about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">first was really</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">because i guess yeah like i can always</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">walk away from things</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">or we all can right you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">sovereignty idea but at a point</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a flip side of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">even to myself it&#39;s like well am i just</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">quitting and walking away</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">versus should i be trying to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">to work with the community because like</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">in my mind i&#39;m like no this is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">reasonable point</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">where we should create a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">we expect the other person to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">we put we don&#39;t do it in a negative way</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s when somebody can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">something and it&#39;s very clear like i</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">abuse to keep pushing at them and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">respect it and just walk away</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">but yeah so it&#39;s kind of i think when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">if we use that example and we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">little bit a month ago there</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">during that and part of my grind was</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">well no i feel like the community should</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">step up a little bit here like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">our what can i expect what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">reasonable expectation of each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">and whether or not it&#39;s in the game b</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">space really trying to decide for myself</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">well how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">i need to navigate these dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">because if i walk away and grab my ball</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">every time i don&#39;t like something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">also not a solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t fair to because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">cop out at a point right because then</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">you&#39;re telling everybody that they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">never fight for what they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">and well that wouldn&#39;t get us very far</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">either so of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a balance of course but</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">that was yeah so that was where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">where i get triggered on the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">idea because i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">i&#39;m scared that it&#39;s going to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">this thing that&#39;s going to be used in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">perpetuity to dismiss me and i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">ever expect to be reasonably heard i</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">this person screaming at me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">important that we all agree this wall is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">white</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">i&#39;m supposed to just leave now and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">not going to deal with this and</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">moments i suppose which is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">somewhat like what you&#39;re kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">know it depends what&#39;s at stake of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s the question that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">ultimately hoping to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">do you even know what yeah suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">i would give are that i feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">we all do this you&#39;re dealing with an</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">individual like it&#39;s the group</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">right that this i don&#39;t remember who the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">person was so this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">right instead of one person in game b</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">now the difference is game</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">like i think you would see how wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">that is if it was like a dating</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">relationship right where like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">cheated on you or like</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">oh women are horrible or all men are</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">horrible</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">yeah you can live in that but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">why are they why do they want me to hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">the door</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">for them and not hold the door open for</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">them because they&#39;re two different</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">people right they&#39;re not the same person</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t think my problem with my</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">rationality on it i&#39;m definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">projecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">everybody in game b is this and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">the great thing about</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">the the group i the community i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">anyways that i&#39;m gaining a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">is the fact that i know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">different views in there that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">know very confidently that i do not</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">agree with but</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">learning their perspective and why you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">know i think it is valuable and i&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">with that so</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">i am but even on but even for them i</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">how do i put this i feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">sovereignty thing it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s a very important core</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">concept it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">and having some kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">expectation or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">norm it&#39;s like at what point do we uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">step up because let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">anarchy thing too which contributes</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">because they&#39;re like oh we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">government we can just you know mutual</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">aid and we&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">society will stand up and stand up for</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">the right thing and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">okay but this is kind of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">then when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">then talking to most anarchists and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">can&#39;t have a rational</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">dialogue either where it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">nothing&#39;s ever going to happen here</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">and your answer to everything is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">community will solve it but even in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">moment the community is not solving it</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">they&#39;re so you know which of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">i can&#39;t make anything but i have i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">trying to determine</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">when do i give up on a community maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like when is it me and i&#39;ve gotta</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">keep pushing on me or when it has the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">sovereignty thing let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">become a cop out for behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s owning their frankly</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">like yeah yeah and game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">is a weird group because like women</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">right that we&#39;re not a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">um like women didn&#39;t get hurt</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to not cheat we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">have chairs pulled out for us or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like i&#39;m a woman and i have my own</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">thoughts and they align with</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">other women sometimes and don&#39;t align</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">with other women sometimes and i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">we can get that with women</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.040" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">but we ca even though we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">continually be like wait why are why</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">have you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">all not democratically decided on what</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">how my actions should affect you oh my</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">how my choice should that game be is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">weird nebulous it&#39;s kind of because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:37.760" style="s2">an organization that started decided</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">rules this you know what i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">like it could have maybe and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">even think it should have because i</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">think that it is trying to be more</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">like hey all we&#39;re here for is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">trying to create an omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">anti-robbery</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">and find your own groups and yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">authority yeah i agree and i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">comfortable with those kind of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">and frankly that&#39;s probably how i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">gotten</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">where i am um well at least my story of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">life is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">i know these answers aren&#39;t nice and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">easy and clean and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">you know we definitely have some in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">group and you find them in all of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">that think they can just create this</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">nice structure and everything&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">um so i definitely wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">definitely at this stage would i even</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">want to suggest like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">rules but i feel like there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">i guess if we look at game b as being</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">okay well this is what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">kind of aim towards like i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">all of us in there at least in our own</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">minds are going towards that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">better for all of us kind of idea now</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">i&#39;m sure a lot of those better for all</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">do not align</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s still kind of the same essence</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">like there&#39;s something there that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">aligned on</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">and i guess i feel like those ideas uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">being accountable each other there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">loosely some like there&#39;s a point when</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">it seems absurd</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">for it not to be like hey guys like</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">we&#39;ve got and i get maybe kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">triggered</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">on that some of these rules like it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">an absolute line in the sand it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:01.599" style="s2">okay well</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">because like to me at a point i i agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.599" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">like ad hominem attacks attacking the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">is not where you want to start to be on</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">the ideas but at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a time when the person</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">or being the problem it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">need to define them</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s like okay like when do i say</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">hey group</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">are we serious like should i be hanging</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">out with you guys</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">like what is this and no this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">me it&#39;s my sovereignty i should walk</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">away again it&#39;s like no i&#39;ve done enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">so yeah so there&#39;s a few that like</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">sometimes you are arguing about whether</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">the sky is blue right and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">want to dig your feet in and do it more</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">and yet there&#39;s no point to that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">either is or isn&#39;t and the other persons</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">are going to see it or not see it</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">and so the group being like okay the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">sky&#39;s blue no one can say anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">else it&#39;s like well that&#39;s maybe helping</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">one but most of the time we&#39;re arguing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">one person thinks they&#39;re arguing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">sky is blue and another person&#39;s arguing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">yeah but what about sunrise and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">you know what i mean like you&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">right but you&#39;re not going to see from</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">resistance position point of view and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.119" style="s2">my my suggestion would be like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">happened with your conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.119" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">whatever his name is because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">and actually your example even right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">like i will readily admit that it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">more what you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">like i</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">i had a hard time accepting because to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">me and i&#39;m pretty sure i could</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">you know illustrate that if anybody at</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">the time including me to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">you know step by step pointed out you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">know i was putting myself in their shoe</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">and showing</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">some kind of acknowledgement of where</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">they&#39;re coming from but like no this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">and they weren&#39;t doing that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">what triggered me but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">right in hindsight they just weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">able to grasp that it&#39;s not and i know</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">that there&#39;s people like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">and so then yeah so you know mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">this that case actually i agree it was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">me thing to grow and learn to sit with</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">fine but it you know there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">it&#39;s aggregated</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">you know who knows there&#39;s stuff going</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">on in my life but then it&#39;s not like all</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">of us so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">but yeah it still brings up that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">hey when i guess it&#39;s a level of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">to have confidence if you invest with</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">any group of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">um like i&#39;m asking myself like am i</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">being smart at times and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">currently wrestling with that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">have i just gone into a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">where it&#39;s like i think i should be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">to expect this</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">of each other they should be expected of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">and yeah like you know that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">get cycled on maybe we all do but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s just i don&#39;t even yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">there&#39;s not really an answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s an important discussion</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">because if like a bunch of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">in game b</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">right or attacking someone or doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">something that&#39;s very different than one</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">on one</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">like where it is then it is kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">b that&#39;s doing it even though it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">not it&#39;s five individuals in game b</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">not necessarily that kind of like as an</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">individual with sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">who has decided to walk away there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">three options to walk away from right</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">you can walk away from that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">you can walk away from that individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">or you can walk away from the group</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">and it depends on your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">the individual it depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">relationship with the group</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">right that like yes you can outside and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">be like i&#39;m walking away and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">not gonna have this conversation or walk</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">like we could get in a fight during this</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve literally never but like</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">you know what i needed like that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">never talking again or does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">that we have a conversation later to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">to deal with it right so you can walk</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">this is too heated i&#39;m leaving</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna kill my sovereignty yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">i&#39;m never dealing with jubilee again she</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to do omega rules she</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold her own sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t hold my sovereignty when she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">not holding hers i&#39;m walking away from</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">or you&#39;re walking away from your</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">organization i&#39;m in right like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">like which would make sense if it was if</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">it was mlm right because it&#39;s like mine</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">is coming through me</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">versus game b which isn&#39;t mine but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">right so yeah which one are you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">and which one are you making it mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">right does jubilee equal game b and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">therefore it was everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">or that that kind of thing and so i just</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">go with what can i learn out of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">and where can i find my sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">i found it&#39;s helped me evolve</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">drastically but the world doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:18.079" style="s2">at it like i evolved if anything they</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">look at it like i default and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.079" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">here i am in my with all the naked</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">emperors and you guys are just like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">but that&#39;s what i signed up for in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">pla on this in this lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">is to have that position yeah i know for</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">sure like ultimately of course yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">it comes down you got it you can only</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">make your own choices and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">you know sometimes that may turn out</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">that oh you&#39;re just screwed and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">your only choice in life is to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">screwed um</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">so so yeah like i yeah it really depends</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">i guess i know if just to put it like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">stark contrast maybe just you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">leaving it in the spot is because i</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">most people would accept this like in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a point when it becomes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">just say you know sexism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">um so women that are just if you walked</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">into a room and a bunch of guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">harassing you and it was one guy but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">rest of us are sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">but we just let it happen right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">you walking away though especially if</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">say let&#39;s say let&#39;s not even call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">just you know that&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t just walk away from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">economy the world and survive you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a point when expecting you to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">use your sovereignty and walk away</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">is expecting you to sacrifice your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">so that we can chill</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">and yeah so that&#39;s an extreme start but</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of because i would say i</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">think a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:45.119" style="s2">a good like if i walk into a room with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">bunch of guys and one guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.119" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">you know making rape jokes at me about</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">me i think that would be very clear and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">i would yeah i would disown the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">the men for not doing i&#39;d be like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">walking away from all of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">but if i walk into a room and one guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">like hey why don&#39;t you smile you&#39;d look</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">so much prettier if you smile</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">now that&#39;s clearly sexism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.760" style="s2">clearly but like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:05.119" style="s2">the men might not know that right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.760" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">men might be like i just asked her to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">smile like it&#39;s not their same world</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">view and so i could i</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">i could experience i should know that by</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">now like if they&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">anything but yeah i guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">by now yeah for sure but like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">because of your world view that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">seen right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">once you encounter something enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">times you&#39;re like how has everyone not</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">encountered this but it&#39;s like the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">the universe works</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">that you encounter the same thing over</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">and over again yeah like i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">down to the amount of times i go into a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">restaurant in vancouver and i&#39;m like do</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">you guys have fair trade coffee and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re like what&#39;s fair trade coffee</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">oh really what you&#39;re part of vancouver</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">what fair trade coffees but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve never encountered it like</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna help to be like you idiot</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">how do you don&#39;t know what you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">remember too we&#39;re like 20 years older</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">than some of these new people</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh yeah that&#39;s right you guys</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t even born when yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">exactly right yeah no it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so yeah interesting i guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">it is a dialogue just i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">important to always have because</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">because the truth is let&#39;s just say in</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">one of those examples say you did walk</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">away but then you were going to starve</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">and you have a kid and they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">able to eat like because there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">options available you know then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">like you really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">and yeah so it gets to the extreme and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">guess if i was just to put</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">my kind of at least the moment that time</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">we were talking in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s game b or anybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">owes this to me um</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">but in my mind i&#39;m taking or and always</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.839" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">i really give myself what i&#39;m going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">is like i really want to invest and make</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">x happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">so you know me coming to the game space</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">is a lot of okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">really going to direct my energy this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">you know really i&#39;m going here and i see</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">a lot of good things but then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">you know part of me is almost i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">pushing because i&#39;m wanting to see like</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">am i going to break this</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.520" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">or is it going to prove to me that this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">is where i should stay and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">exactly what you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">to do you know it&#39;s individual choice</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">but that would definitely have a spoke</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.000" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">to at least that moment of what i was</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">feeling was that frustration is like you</p>

<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">with yours i can&#39;t argue with how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">came to your conclusion because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">based on logic</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">or emotion it&#39;s based on like i just</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that i this is the thing i</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">understanding whatever&#39;s going to come</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">and going from that place she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">wrong for not attending and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">wrong for feeling like you&#39;re god&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">from it totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">no yeah i think i get you i get you for</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">somebody someday if they ever watch this</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">this was useful for them too so</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">um yeah definitely i&#39;m just curious when</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">uh omega group is that a game b group or</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">is that totally separate</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">even if it&#39;s interesting through game b</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">yeah a year ago eric</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">contacted me saying hey is there any</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">wood let&#39;s have this omega group</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">let&#39;s practice i want to practice omega</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">rule i want to make a rule let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">and so we both invited different people</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">and over the course so i&#39;d say a month</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">we ended up um</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">some people fell away and some people</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">came and i&#39;d say for the last year we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">had a rather</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">the five of us that made rather</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">regularly yeah that&#39;d be a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">another it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">ties into the same type of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">because i think i&#39;ve even talked to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">about it that rule omega is like well</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">at one point it&#39;s like this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">clearly not good faith so screw that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like because again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">trap the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">the best good faith person is always at</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">a disadvantage because</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s definitely not they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">never admit it and then you&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">so yeah and there&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">difference also</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">about um typing out a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">and having a conversation on video which</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">is why i had suggested did you guys end</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">up getting on a video chat you and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">no but well you know i won&#39;t draw</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">conclusions on this person i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">surprised but i offered it and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">never heard back from them again i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">think they were very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">learning which</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">to me makes sense based on the way the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">engagement was going like</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">i&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a level of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">obtuseness whether it was fully</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a certain mentality and i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">yeah you know you recognize it when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">see it so</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">but anyways it&#39;s fine and i felt you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">know that&#39;s the kind of person i want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">so and i also agree because uh the way i</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">without i&#39;m pretty blunt generally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">on a text there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">i by default just always assume things</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">are sarcastic in a funny happy way but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">then there&#39;s also people that think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">sarcasm can only be bad</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">so then i&#39;m only bad where</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">that can happen when people are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">me too but at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">i think like you know yeah seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">whole you know me</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">it&#39;s uh yeah least less likely to go bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">so i agree with you um so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s something i&#39;m trying to get</p>
