<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">to say a little preamble and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">we thought we just launched straight</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">into doing the exercise today</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">and uh you know the main thing i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">to say about the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">is it&#39;s one of the most iconic stoic</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">exercises in a sense everyone always</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">talks about it and recognizes it um we</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">call it pierre haddos a modern scholar</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">gave it the the name the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s found in other philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">traditions but i just want to say a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">little bit about why i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">when i first began studying stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">which is nearly 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">now the the first book i wrote which</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">i&#39;ve got here actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">i tried to do like a the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">cbt i tried to do a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">survey of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">ancient stoic techniques or psycho</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">and modern psychotherapy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">i found a lot of parallels but there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">one technique that really jumped out</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">that seemed quite prominent</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">and uh quite important that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">really resemble one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">techniques found in modern psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">you&#39;ll find things that are a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a central focus it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">common technique</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">in modern psychotherapy and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">view from above and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">it makes sense like it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">technique that you could script and do</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">an audio recording of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">there&#39;s different ways you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">so i used to do it with groups of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">psychotherapists i ran a training school</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">for psychotherapists in uk i used to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">speak at</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">psychotherapy conferences and uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">i wrote about it in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">journals and we&#39;ve got i had roomfuls of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">hundreds of psychtherapists doing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">stuff so i got to get their feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">and they really enjoyed doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">so did an audio recording and i put it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">online and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">a chap called patrick fisher who was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">phd student at the university of exeter</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">found the recording and played it to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">group of graduate students there</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">and he had been doing this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">live like galen</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">for a week marcus releases court</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">physician following his</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">health and lifestyle advice and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">patrick thought we could take</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">this and we could do live like marcus</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">aurelius for a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">and he went to his supervisor who was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">christopher gill</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">who&#39;s now professor emeritus of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">thought at extra university</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">and so they started experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">the recording and then they got me to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">down to extra with a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">people and that was the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">modern stories as an organization</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">in 2011 or 2012 and it was the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">of what we now call stoic week</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">so the whole thing in a sense began</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">because i looked at all about 18</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">different psychological techniques i</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">found</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">and this one jumped out because i</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">thought we don&#39;t really do this in psych</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">therapy but we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">and then we started doing it and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">really liked it and they thought yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">should be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">and then that became the central</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">technique of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">the online course that we ran every year</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">down you sink back gently into your body</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">all the way now as your feet slowly come</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">to rest upon the floor</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">once again now think about the room</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">around you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">think about action movement think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">looking around and getting your</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">raising your head a little begin to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">breathe a little bit more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">a little bit more energetically let your</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">body feel more alive</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">and ready for action as you breathe</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">energy and vitality</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">into your body breathe a little deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">and deeper again until you&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">deep breath open your eyes and emerge</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">from the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">taking your mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">self-awareness forward</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">into life beginning now taking a deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">and opening your eyes and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">ready just entering the here and now</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">with deep calm and serenity</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:42.839" style="s2">so there we are the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">exercise a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.839" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">abbreviated version of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">the recording actually that we use for</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">stoic week</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">um so if it&#39;s okay i don&#39;t know how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">are for time people but maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">i follow do you want me to talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">the significance of the exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do some q a in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">yeah i think that would be good maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">talk a little bit more and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">have any questions start putting in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">chat box now and then i&#39;ll call on you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">we have the q a portion cool okay so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">i&#39;ll just mention a couple of little</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">bits of travia i think might be useful</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">because i assume most of you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">quite familiar with stoicism so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">just tell you some bits and pieces about</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">so first of all when i was comparing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">to cbt techniques i couldn&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">technique that was similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">but all of the stoic techniques can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">in terms of the broad cognitive strategy</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">in a kind of abstract sense so there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">techniques that involve</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">expanding our awareness of time</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">or space but they don&#39;t take exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">same form as that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">so one of them actually in cbt would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">um when somebody&#39;s worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">something one of my favorite techniques</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">i think one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">there are visual techniques physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">uh emotional techniques verbal cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.560" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">techniques that we have in therapy we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">lump together what peter calls the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">psycho technology under these different</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">so this is a verbal technique um so</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">somebody&#39;s worrying about a field</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">we can just say what do you think&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">probably going to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">so i think my girlfriend might dump me</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">what do you think&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">well i guess i&#39;ll feel really sad about</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">it and then what do you think&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">going to happen next but i guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll sell home and cry in my beer and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">then what&#39;s probably going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">next well i guess eventually i&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">to start going out and socializing again</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">most probably going to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">well i guess eventually i&#39;ll meet</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">someone else and then what&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">going to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">i guess i&#39;ll have another relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">we can encourage people just by asking</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">that question to expand their temporal</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:53.959" style="s2">perspective a bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">and that is a very powerful form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.959" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">decatastrophizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">there are techniques i know from</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">teaching therapists that look cool on</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">and then there are techniques that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">hard to explain that work very robustly</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">in practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s a technique that&#39;s so simple</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">that people might overlook it but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">works very robustly</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">in a consulting room setting so almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">always if you just ask that question</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">repeatedly it has a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">simple very powerful effect</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">another technique is future cell therapy</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">or time projection or whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">have lots of different names in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:31.760" style="s2">field for the same techniques</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">so we might get someone to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.760" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">themselves in the future imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">themselves 10 years from now looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">on their current situation imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">advice their future self would give them</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s another way of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">broadening your temporal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">um another thing i&#39;d mention about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">view from above there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">one of the things that really appeals to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">me about it that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">there are techniques in stoicism that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">cognitive therapists and researchers</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">would immediately look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">and go that looks like it should work</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">like so that doesn&#39;t mean that it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">going to work um but in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">any field of research does this</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">frustration you see this now actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">with the reception the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">a good example actually would be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">wearing of masks so if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">literature most researchers are like</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">wearing masks should help but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">have a direct</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">uh test of that at the moment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">still kind of pending</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">solid data that directly verifies that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">but from everything that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">know about the like the the science of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">this already it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">so highly suggestive so the view from</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">above</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">is something that any cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">therapist or psychologist would look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">and think</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">that looks like it should do something</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">and even you know prior to having</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">carried out a controlled</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">trial on it and there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">reasons for that but one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">for a start it&#39;s a very simple technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">and it can be scripted</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">so you would be able to look at and go</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">reliably we could get people to broaden</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">and and so it looks like we should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">consistently able to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">a fairly dramatic cognitive change with</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">this technique</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">and it kind of looks like it should</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">change people&#39;s emotions as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">and maybe change their cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">processing a bit so</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">you know anyone looking at would think</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">that&#39;s worth trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">um but also there&#39;s a body of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">a whole bunch of converging research</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">that shows</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">that when people are anxious or also</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">when they&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">um and maybe else even when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">depressed they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">narrow down the scope of their attention</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">so normally we can walk in true</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">government as i like to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">so we can pay attention to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">things at once we could be driving the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">and having a conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">in the back seat and also thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to make for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">so we can do pay attention to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">things but under stress we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">like our attention becomes narrowed in</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">scope</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of like we put the stress</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">cues or the anxiety cues the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">are freaking us out</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">under a magnifying glass and they also</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">captivate our attention more</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">and so recently over the past and by</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">recent i mean over the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">15 years roughly there&#39;s been increasing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">in attentional training techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">because um the stuff that goes on in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">your head</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s involuntary and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">other stuff that&#39;s under voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">strategic control as we call that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">the way that you allocate your attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">is kind of in between there are aspects</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">of it that are under voluntary control</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">so we know you could train</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">people to broaden the scope of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">to externalize their attention rather</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">than focusing it inwardly and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s good emerging evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">shows that that has a profound effect in</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">the treatment of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">and depression so it&#39;s a cutting-edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">in psychotherapy research but the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">were way ahead of the game</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">two and a half thousand years ago by</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">thinking we should be broadening our</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">in perspective that&#39;s antagonistic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">to what happens when people are stressed</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">out anxious or angry</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">and there are a number of ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">this so if you&#39;re frightened</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">and you narrow your attention onto the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">scariest thing in the room</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">and you put it under a magnifying glass</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s going to amplify your anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s also going to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">limiting because you&#39;re not taking in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">other sources of information</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">that might benefit you we sometimes call</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">those safety cues so might be reassuring</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">so there might be some scary monster in</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">the room but you&#39;ve got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">bodyguards around you for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">so if you&#39;re only focusing on the scary</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">monster not taking in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">the bodyguards you have a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">negatively biased</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">perception so you get a more</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">balanced nuanced and complex emotional</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">when you&#39;re able to broaden your</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">perspective and take in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">different stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">at once for healthy to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">the stoics are generally doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">so a couple of that&#39;s some of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">of cognitive science if you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">a couple of other bits of trivia this</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">technique is found in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">a lot of ancient literature not just the</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t really know how or where it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">originated it seems almost intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">some people have described it as almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">a such shamanistic technique weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">um our earliest sources for information</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">on socrates</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">are satires that ridicule him so</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">aristophanes wrote a play called the</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">looking at maps on the ground so he</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">almost ridiculing or satirizing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">something like the view from above like</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">socrates is suspended</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">among the clouds looking down his</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">students who are also looking down</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">uh maps of the the known world and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">contemplating a map</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">or a diagram would be another way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">the view from above which i guess leads</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">me on to another observation</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">which is in the ancient world you could</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">compare this</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">and people have done to kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">themes and one</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">is uh if you imagine the view of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">gods looking down from mount olympus</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve all seen things like clash of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">titans where zeus is looking down and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">humans are like little chess pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">so this kind of image of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">looking down from olympus</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">naturally evokes the idea of the view</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">from above and so in a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">very much the stoics thought of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">way of entering or emulating the mind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">zeus</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">so becoming more godlike and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">kind of the goal of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">but to enter into this perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">also to enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">the mind of the the sophos the wise man</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">or woman</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">likes a practicing review from above is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">kind of a perspective shifting exercise</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">that allows us to get more into a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">god-like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">or sage-like perspective but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">there&#39;s another way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">which is less mythological</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">and more cosmological and so when</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">ancient philosophers discuss</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">the nature of the universe and time as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">whenever they discuss it or draw</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">diagrams of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">you can imagine that as a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">exercise so when they&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">what they they think the planets are</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">like what the universe looks like</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">this is like a meditation to them and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">again when they&#39;re ridiculing socrates</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">as resembling natural philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">looking down at these maps and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">this is more in the cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">tradition he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">he&#39;s like a proto-scientist almost but</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to encompass the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">universe and his</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">his mind in this way um</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s one other thing now i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">make a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">a geographical observation about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">when marcus</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">describes the view from above he says</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">imagine law courts and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">political assemblies and people trading</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">and arguing and milling around</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">and he says in the agorai in the agoras</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">the marketplaces or city centers and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">it just so happens that in athens where</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">socrates lived</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">like in many ancient uh towns it grew up</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">around a hill called the acropolis</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">which literally means like acro like</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">acrobat</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">and paulus like uh metropolis it means</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">the high up part of the city</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">so the view from above is the view from</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">the athenian acropolis</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">where the parthenon is located the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">temple of athena the goddess of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">socrates would have been familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">this perspective he only had to walk up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">the hill</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">or any of the other hills surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">athens and looked down and he would have</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">seen the agora where he was subsequently</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">to be put on trial and executed one day</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">so if you think of it when marcus</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">aurelius is describing this he very much</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">he could be describing the view from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">athenian</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">acropolis literally you could walk up</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">there and look down in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">and agora guess one other thing i might</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">mention about to take it back to cbt and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">cognitive therapy some of you who have</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">read books on cbt will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">aware of this idea which we don&#39;t use as</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">much anymore</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">but in second wave cbt there was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">of talk about thinking errors or</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">cognitive distortions</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">and they are kind of useful in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">so one of them is called selective</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">abstraction and bec defined that as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">process of focusing on a detail</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">taken out of context and ignoring the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">most salient features of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">such as safety cues and conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">the whole experience on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">this element</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">which is a convoluted way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">selective thinking selective awareness</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s also called having a mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">filter i would also call a lie of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">to yourself or a half truth so one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">distortions is taking things out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">and putting things back in a broader</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">context would be like what the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">are doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">with the view from above and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">thinking error or cognitive distortion</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">or bias</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">is also linked to other errors that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">call magnification</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">or catastrophizing because when we put</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">things in a bigger context we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">likely to de-catastrophizing them</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">and and also to over-generalization</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">because when we think of things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">of a much bigger context</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">we&#39;re more likely to see them as part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">and varied and diverse richer experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">and less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">over generalize on the basis of a single</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">so we can think of this in in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">rectifying thinking errors as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">and then there&#39;s one more thing i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">before i guess we maybe we have some</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">pierre hadou is one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">scholars in</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">in the stoicism field one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">academics said that the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">is one of the most important stoic</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">contemplative exercises</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">because especially if you practice it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">about you realize it kind of brings</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">many of the other stoic themes so</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">sometimes people can get lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">uh lost in the weeds of stoicism like i</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">said there are 18 distinct</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">identified in my the first book that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">it but many of those techniques are</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">evoked by the viewer from above</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">so for example some of the concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">techniques are</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">when we think of the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">it&#39;s closely linked</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">to stoic theology because stoics were</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">pantheists and they believed the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">universe as a whole was divine</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">so if you believe the universe as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">whole is sacred then</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">you have a kind of religious obligation</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">piety would consist</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">in trying to contemplate the totality of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">to put the universe back together and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">that&#39;s doing the view from above it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">contemplating god</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">for the stoics and also the stoic idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">of determinism like seeing things as</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">physical material causes leading up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">them in particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">is a major part of being surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">so when we do the view from above we</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">think of things within their historical</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">context that&#39;s linked</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">to stoic determinism it&#39;s also linked to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">contemplation of impermanence or the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">transience of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">because when you broaden your temporal</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">perspective you have to take in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">the moment when you have something but</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">you also imagine</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">the potential future when it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">be gone or the time before it even</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">existed</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">and then that would apply to yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">well so it&#39;s also linked to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">military thanatos or the contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">of our own mortality if you do the view</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">from above</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">and think about your life within the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">history of the universe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">necessarily think of it as a small blip</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">you&#39;ll think about the time before you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">were born and after you&#39;ll be gone</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">another theme for the stoics is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">reversal of fortune the wheel of fortune</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">that someone might lose a girlfriend and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">catastrophe but then later they might</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">find another one a better relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">they might lose a job</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">and find a better job they might win the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">lottery but then might go on to lose all</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">their friends or squander the money on</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">drugs or something</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">so this idea that fortune goes up and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">down and there are many reversals of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">fortune</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s something that we necessarily evoke</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">when we start to picture the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">um and again i think it all comes back</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">to the stoic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">trying to stretch your mind to tap in to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">this inner resource</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">that allows us somehow the stoic stop by</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">some miracle</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">we had nature has given us this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">to imagine what the sage might think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">even though we&#39;re not sages</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">we can kind of imagine what a sage might</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">by stretching our minds and using our</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:30.799" style="s2">and this exercise of contemplating the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">sage is also facilitated by the view</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.799" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">from above because the sage</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">would necessarily be somebody who&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">attuned</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">to the bigger perspective and that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">uh my little run through of some trivia</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">that i thought might quit your appetite</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">for a discussion what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">that peter</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">yeah yeah we had some um questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">already in the chat box and i have a few</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">uh question for you right now uh so if</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">anyone has any questions throw in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">chat box you want me to read on your</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">behalf let me know this will go on</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">youtube</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">um so we we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">uh sort of like you know john vicki</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">calls it the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">and a very curious like a stoic ecology</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">of practice or stoic proper ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">um and stoic week is kind of like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">and also sort of like a psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">practices that can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">be figured out collectively so just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">because the one thing that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">cool about</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">stoicism is that the lineage has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">cut so we don&#39;t really know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">pastel it&#39;s practiced so we can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">entrepreneurial in the sense um</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">any thoughts on how that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">right now in the modern stoic movement</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">and how it could emerge</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">i think there&#39;s so much opportunity i</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">think hadou was like a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">god centers and the strange thing about</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">pr hadou was he did a very thorough</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">review of the ancient literature</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">and listed what he called spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">exercises and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">what struck me was that he never made</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">any connection with modern psychology</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">so he kind of handed this thesis to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">on a play</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">you know he&#39;s hadou says here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">different exercises in the stoics and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">classical philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">and they left it to other people like i</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">was able to come along and go oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">how they compare to things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">in modern psychotherapy but i&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">scratched the surface</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a huge opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">for other people now who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">interested in modern personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">development literature psychological</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">modern philosophy psychotherapy to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2">other connections and there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">opportunity to do research on stoic</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">techniques and refine them</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">as a consequence of doing research to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">compare it to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">ideas and resilience building and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">positive psychology and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">psychological psychological traditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">not just cbte</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">so we we now have all these online</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">communities where people can share their</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">and give feedback and also well you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">carry out all sorts of apply all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">of different research methods</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">to the stoic techniques and modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">stoicism is kind of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">we&#39;re finding some things out so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">finding out which techniques people seem</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">to find easiest</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">which are more beneficial for them you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">know which ones maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">they use more consistently over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">longer term these are all things we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">test as well as the actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">psychological effect of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">and refinements in practice i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">emerge from you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">playing around with things in all those</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">cool cool um okay so uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">pranab if you want to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">and read your question</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">sure um thanks for yeah thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">exercise thanks for your work it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">really great</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">um from your research and experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">what are some of the limits of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">cbt and other cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">techniques where other techniques could</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">be more effective and are there certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">conditions or mindsets of people of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">where you kind of draw that line um</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">or just want to hear you think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">that oh boy that would take a whole day</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">to like a lot of good questions i i</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:03.679" style="s2">could probably talk all day about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">so i have to think of the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.679" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">to give you the kenneth tldr abbreviated</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">um first thing i&#39;d say is that cbt is</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">um from a previous generation</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">right so the the founders of cbt did the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">pioneering work in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">19 even in the 1950s uh 1960s 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">it didn&#39;t really become mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">properly until the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">um was ages ago now like that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">decades ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">and and actually subsequent generations</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">are getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">the the generation that followed them</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">are getting a bit old now</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already moved beyond cbt to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">some extent so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">we talk about three waves in</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">psychotherapy in</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">an evidence-based tradition so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">behavior therapy which</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s hard to date in a way but</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">it sort of originated in the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">and then the second wave of back and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">ellis and cognitive therapy</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">it&#39;s haiti if you like was in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">70s 80s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">and then from the 1990s onwards we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">what we call the third wave</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">of uh cbt or acceptance and commitment</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">and other mindfulness and acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">based approaches</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">so i i don&#39;t know there are two ways i</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">could answer you one is to say well what</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">if we look even beyond that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">like but i think we&#39;re kind of still in</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">the middle of the third wave so maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">would say the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">things we know are</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">one of the limitations of cbt is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">kind of overly analytical and verbal and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">people that are prone to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">overthinking um like some</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">clients with obsessive traits like ocd</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">health anxiety generalized anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">disorder</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">um even some depressed clients are prone</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">ruminate overthink over analyze things</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">and traditional or second wave cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">sometimes backfired with those clients</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">so i&#39;ll give you a concrete example of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">if you have a client with generalized</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">anxiety disorder pathological worrying</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">you could call it</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">and you give them a thought record like</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">you may have seen in cbt write down your</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">man they&#39;ll come back at the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">session and they might have a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">papers like that deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">right and then the therapist should have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">alarm bells ringing thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">this looks more like a symptom than a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">like it looks like it looks like they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">turned the therapy into</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">uh an extension of their symptom so</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">they&#39;re writing way too much stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">beneficial beyond that point so the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">third wave approaches</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">have focused on actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">having kind of meta approach getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">people to step back from the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">and notice when the thinking&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">too long</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">notice the consequences of the style of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">and basically to learn to manage</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">rumination or perseverative</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">thinking styles that&#39;s a ah an important</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">another thing was the second wave cbt</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">acknowledged cognitive distancing</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">but beck thought the if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">dispute people if you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">people&#39;s faulty</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">thinking and then getting to weigh up</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">the evidence for it which is what we did</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">used to do in second wave cbt still do</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">in some ways um is a preamble a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">precursor to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">a prerequisite to it it has to be up for</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">so if somebody thinks this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">catastrophe that i&#39;ve lost my job</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">um and you&#39;re going to get them to weigh</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">up the evidence for that and so on</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">that they have to be able to think well</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">maybe there are other ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">but if they think no it just is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">catastrophe it&#39;s a fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">then they don&#39;t have enough separation</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">to even begin</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">questioning it right so beck thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.440" style="s2">well before we even get started we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">going to have to get them to realize</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.440" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re catastrophizing it that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">this is just one</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">arbitrary way of looking at it and there</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">might be better or</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">alternative ways of seeing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">so he&#39;d get clients to do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">he&#39;d say okay let&#39;s weigh up the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s a catastrophe and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">what people realized was the the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">cognitive distancing approach was far</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">more powerful than they realized and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">maybe that could almost be a whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">therapy in its own right and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">realize that when you get people to just</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">do focus more on the distancing um</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">it starts to kind of resemble stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">goes on in mindfulness meditation</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">because if you&#39;re doing meditation you</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">don&#39;t start shredding all your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">and weighing up the evidence for them</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">that would be like overthinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">if you notice a negative thought you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">just kind of take a step back and look</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">at it and go oh hi</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">and respond as if it&#39;s just a cloud</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">passing across the sky</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t get in a debate with it um</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">and so the idea of just doing cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">distancing would be kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">meditating</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">and so for 10 15 20 years or so people</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">have been doing research on that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve substantiated that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s clear now um the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">cognitive distancing might be more</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">important than cognitive disputation</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">and that encouraging people to do too</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">much disputation might have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">kind of leading them down the wrong path</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:18.960" style="s2">so that that&#39;s one answer but then i</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">would say that in some ways the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">already knew that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">i think um you don&#39;t actually see the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">stoics</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">putting the same kind of emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">evaluating evidence that vectored</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">um you know what what they go on about</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">is just realizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">that our value judgments are</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">uh fundamentally misplaced</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re the source of our suffering</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">and that that&#39;s cognitive distancing</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">so i think it was kind of a mistake when</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">people thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">the um stoicism resembled back</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">because stoicism kind of went beyond</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">beck and in some ways it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">third wave approaches that have emerged</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">subsequently</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">does it i hope that answers your</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">question that was great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">uh to piggyback on that david you had uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">some thoughts to share on cbt</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">and some buddhist traditions i believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">sure donald i welcome your uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">reflections</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">on um so i work at a cbt</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">clinic i&#39;m also a meditation teacher</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">and in the 10 plus years i&#39;ve been there</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">people have gone from</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">whispering that they&#39;re looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">to my talk on mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">so actually doing some research on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">this um i&#39;m also currently looking</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">at hedo and socrates</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">and to keep it brief ways</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">in which early philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">a transformative and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">enterprise cbt</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">is still kind of inheriting the</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">science envy get things that are</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">get things we can put onto a a survey</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">in general what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">on the relationship between cbt-informed</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">psychotherapy and what&#39;s traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">more categorized as spiritual even</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">practices in humanity well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">phd thesis type question that i could</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">talk about for like a week or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">so i&#39;ll try and think</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">what would be the best thing to sell</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">select out and focus on</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ll tell you i&#39;ll answer it my</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">way really and then and then maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">have a think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:46.839" style="s2">what you might be driving at i when i</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">wrote this book funnily enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">um one of the things i said in it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">is the look it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">it is a fair way actually before i even</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">discovered stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">i felt as a cbt practitioner the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">um the fundamental thing that determined</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">our thinking errors and so on were our</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">moral values and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">thought for example someone&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">materialistic and the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">everything for them turns on um</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">accumulating wealth</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">or if somebody&#39;s really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">preoccupied with what other people think</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of their philosophy of life</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">you know those are their underlying</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">values and they inherit them</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">to some extent from the prevailing</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">culture and uh you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">get people to reevaluate those in</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">therapy but there&#39;s kind of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">with doing that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">which is this thing of therapist</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">neutrality</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">so you you can kind of go so far</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">in a conventional consulting room</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">setting but arguably the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t try and um indoctrinate the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">client into a particular set of moral</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">you know certainly if you phrase it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">that people go oh no no like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">therapist shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">indoctrinating the client now what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">might assume if you&#39;re a socratic</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">would be that if you get people to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">reflect and question</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">their values they&#39;re often going to end</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">up in a similar place</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">but nevertheless i felt that you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">used to say to me do you teach stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:18.079" style="s2">to therapy clients</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">and i i used to think well i can&#39;t yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.079" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">and no</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">usually in practice what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">they know that i write about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">and so they jostle up and ask me about</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">it but i can&#39;t start teaching stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">to people in the way that i do cbt with</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">because stoicism is uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">a moral philosophy um like if they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">muslim</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">or a christian or a marxist or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">they are the values implicit and sources</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">might conflict in some ways with their</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">existing moral values and worldview so i</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">introduce it and talk to them about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.480" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">but i can&#39;t just indoctrinate them into</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:57.119" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:59.200" style="s2">they might not agree with it as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.200" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">so the the there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">question there though about whether</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">certain world views and sets of moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">nevertheless might turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">healthier than others</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">and i feel that the stoic worldview is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">healthy but i do wonder</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">whether although it can kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">into the traditional consulting room</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">therapy in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.640" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">um whether there&#39;s a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">for stoicism it&#39;s something that people</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">elect to embrace a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">more moral and philosophical level</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">almost like converting to religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">like converting to christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">something like that and i do wonder</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">whether</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of that with</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">introducing buddhist themes to clients</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">and in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">i i thought early on that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">there are going to be some clients who</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">say they don&#39;t like the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">anything associated with buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">they&#39;re maybe um very orthodox christian</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">or or they follow some other religion or</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">the they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">other a kind of odd atheist in a a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">you know maybe they see buddhism as</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">conflicting with that and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">kind of emerged a little bit more over</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">time that there are some clients that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">that don&#39;t like the idea of of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">doing something associated with a a</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">quasi religion</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">in in the consulting room setting um</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">so i think stoicism&#39;s great strength is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">its greatest weakness in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s too ideological it&#39;s too kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">moral it&#39;s too spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.400" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">in some ways to be delivered in a normal</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">cbt framework</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">but in other respects that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">what makes it so profound and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">i wonder what you think of that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">know if i answered gets to the gist of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">your question or not but</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of where i came at it from</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">well it very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">touches on it and i&#39;m rather</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">overeducated in both</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">arenas psychotherapy phd and a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">master&#39;s degrees in religious studies</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">and advisors in each department who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">pretty sure i belonged in the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">department</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">yeah the emphasis i&#39;m hearing as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">the healthy heart</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">of psychotherapy cbt stoicism is on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">experiential procedures on the actual</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">practices and of course hedo</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">emphasizes that as you you&#39;ve pointed</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">out so</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">finding you also looking to socratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">methods getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">people to connect with what they already</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">and kind of setting aside some of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">categories the boxes this is such and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">such a religion or this is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">such philosophical tradition we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">always got that sort of inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">but again a healthy heart seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">if you want to help somebody change love</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">them the way they are and help put them</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">in touch with what they</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">already know with that kind of toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">okay in that case and in response to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">what you said i think i would need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">introduce a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">um so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">there are a bunch of techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">stoicism and concepts that we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">apply now many of those are actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">shared with epicureanism and platonism</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">and aristotelianism and other</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">uh hellenistic uh and classical</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">philosophical traditions</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">so they&#39;re not entirely uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">exclusive to stoicism so what academics</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">in this field would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">is that what makes stoicism stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:25.599" style="s2">like the beating heart of stoicism the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">defining characteristic of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.599" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">is its moral philosophy that says that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">arity is the only true good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">right and that it&#39;s at that point i</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">think that it becomes more problematic</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">so in terms of like the 18 techniques or</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">so yeah sure we can take most of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">and we could do them in a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">framework we could do them in an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">framework we could do them</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">in a christian framework as hadou talks</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">but people would say well is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">stoicism anymore are those just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">accidental features of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">that you could also have taken from</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">epicureanism as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">is the thing that the marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">thinks defines stoicism and the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">that the other stoics think really</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">define their</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">philosophy and make it what is would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">this idea that are they rita</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">is the only true good and that would</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">arguably</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.280" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">clash with it might not be completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">irreconcilable with</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly on the face of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real question mark</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">over whether you can reconcile that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.359" style="s2">with christian ethics or buddhist ethics</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">or marxist ethics</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.359" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">like because it&#39;s essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">particular moral doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">and what intrigued me was that i believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">that following that moral doctrine has</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">mental health benefits and contributes</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">emotional resilience but it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">that some people don&#39;t agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">and and they hold different moral values</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">that clash with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">and what in which case if they took the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">techniques from stoicism they might</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">end up turning it uh into something</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">that&#39;s more like epicureanism or</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">more like greek skepticism or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">like that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">so but definitely in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">taking the techniques out of stories as</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">i&#39;m sure we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">absolutely assimilate those into</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">psychotherapy but</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">the question people will then raise is</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">is this still stoicism that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">or is it just a kind of eclectic</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">derivative of hellenistic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">well there&#39;s nothing wrong with doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">okay um we are about uh at the hour mark</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to stop the questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">there there&#39;s a few other questions we</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">um get to so uh um</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">donald is anything uh you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">leave people off where they can find you</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing right now with uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">the modern sources of movement</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">yeah a couple of things that might uh be</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">worth mentioning</p>
