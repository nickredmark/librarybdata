<p begin="00:00:09.059" end="00:00:12.809" style="s2">our projects we&#39;ve done last week try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">give an elevator pitch without bitch</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.809" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">Barnett play a little game a so we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">get to game B and it&#39;s just a roll and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">this morning but we&#39;re pretty sure other</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">people will be joining soon so it&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">you want to start giving your update as</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">to how wiki elections go inner you so</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">wiki election is going okay still been</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">working with Bentley and a douche on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:41.850" style="s2">early mock-ups for its I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">on the draft abet yes technically the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">second project kind of also counts here</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">which is I mean keeping sort of part of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">the planning not super open but roughly</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like a patreon or a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">Kickstarter for game be we announced</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">that to sort of in the post meet the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">post set posts meeting wrap up I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">you call it we&#39;ve discussed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">yesterday and I will be drafting out</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:16.500" style="s2">respects on that and particularly how</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">sort of things overlap with with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.500" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">election and how the overall design flow</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">will end up going and how the two things</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">will talk so we&#39;ll be hearing more on</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">that and part of the reason why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">also happened is so that I can create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">a project on there for wiki elections so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:41.240" style="s2">I mean those two are quite tied if that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.240" end="00:01:46.400" style="s2">all right thank you my project is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:49.220" style="s2">process raising and solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.400" end="00:01:50.869" style="s2">Schlueter nazianz going fairly well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.220" end="00:01:52.190" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna stop doing it live bow</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.869" end="00:01:54.050" style="s2">because I think there is a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.190" end="00:01:57.770" style="s2">quality to doing it live versus doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.050" end="00:01:59.450" style="s2">recorded and putting it up this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.770" end="00:02:01.670" style="s2">second week we&#39;ve had a processor easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.450" end="00:02:03.560" style="s2">and so a conversation it&#39;s just Raymond</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.670" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">Eric Shiloh and I talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.560" end="00:02:07.670" style="s2">how could we come up with the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">ten thousand people should follow and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.670" end="00:02:12.290" style="s2">we&#39;re still not even there like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.560" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">still not even like understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.290" end="00:02:15.080" style="s2">each other is trying to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:17.450" style="s2">conversation and so it&#39;s this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.080" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">chaos that something is emerging from</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.450" end="00:02:21.650" style="s2">but like every time we have a we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:22.700" style="s2">conversation I get more clear I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.650" end="00:02:24.680" style="s2">oh I think what we&#39;re talkin is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.700" end="00:02:27.230" style="s2">governance versus process and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.680" end="00:02:30.590" style="s2">versus versus that and figuring out like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.230" end="00:02:32.690" style="s2">I just know I&#39;m not gonna be proven</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.590" end="00:02:34.040" style="s2">wrong until we like until there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.690" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">thousand people who could work through a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.040" end="00:02:37.580" style="s2">project and then say yes it absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.900" end="00:02:39.709" style="s2">Falls the partners nothing we can do</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.580" end="00:02:41.180" style="s2">about it that the power of having ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.709" end="00:02:42.860" style="s2">thousand people create something or more</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.180" end="00:02:44.269" style="s2">or less like just a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.860" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">people creating something round up for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.269" end="00:02:47.480" style="s2">their funding it together and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:49.670" style="s2">deciding what&#39;s in it gives it the power</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.480" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">that it needs to actually be successful</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.670" end="00:02:55.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s the only way I can create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:57.380" style="s2">technology project anyway so so working</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.400" end="00:02:58.910" style="s2">through that process and seeing all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.380" end="00:03:00.920" style="s2">the triggers that are happening in game</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.910" end="00:03:04.130" style="s2">B that are like in me that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.920" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">reiterating right like that other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.130" end="00:03:06.920" style="s2">want other people jump on their project</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">I have the solution I have the solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.920" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">and we all know I also feel that way we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">all feel that way but being with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">and working through how can we bring our</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:17.570" style="s2">different ideas to the table and still</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:19.100" style="s2">have something come out of it for</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.570" end="00:03:20.420" style="s2">process raising as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.100" end="00:03:22.519" style="s2">individual projects that people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.420" end="00:03:24.109" style="s2">still bringing to to process raising</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.519" end="00:03:26.450" style="s2">because for all still individuals with</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.109" end="00:03:29.260" style="s2">our opinion and bias so the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.450" end="00:03:31.940" style="s2">working through that is in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.260" end="00:03:34.670" style="s2">valuable even if nothing comes from it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.940" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">but showcase it so that is a bit of oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.670" end="00:03:40.700" style="s2">and this Wednesday we&#39;re tackling</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:42.920" style="s2">prisons which should be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.700" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">because it was it happens not that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.920" end="00:03:47.269" style="s2">there&#39;s an always police brutality but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.680" style="s2">it happened before the charge</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.269" end="00:03:51.650" style="s2">slight thing that I scheduled it and now</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.680" end="00:03:52.820" style="s2">it&#39;s all okay that is gonna clearly come</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.650" end="00:03:53.330" style="s2">into I mean you can&#39;t talk about prison</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.820" end="00:03:55.490" style="s2">so talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:58.550" style="s2">racism so I&#39;m interesting cuz it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.490" end="00:04:00.770" style="s2">be one I haven&#39;t I have very little</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.550" end="00:04:03.110" style="s2">solution for besides data and keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.770" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">holding you don&#39;t witnessing and so see</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.110" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">what what actually comes out about and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:08.120" style="s2">can we tackle something right we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:11.480" style="s2">change the entire prison system or what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.120" end="00:04:13.370" style="s2">could 10,000 people do to improve it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.480" end="00:04:15.560" style="s2">their loved ones or their their</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.370" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">hypothetical loved ones that might end</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.560" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">up there themselves so that is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:24.350" style="s2">process and solution easy look like at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.060" style="s2">the moment it was like no one has</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.350" end="00:04:27.530" style="s2">actually joined us during this part if</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.060" end="00:04:31.580" style="s2">they do join us they can always give us</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:34.010" style="s2">their their update otherwise we can you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">know shoot for now we know we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.010" end="00:04:39.470" style="s2">no no no they&#39;re not wicked shoot the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2"> for an hour knowing that we&#39;re live</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.470" end="00:04:52.130" style="s2">and like I say that recorded that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:53.930" style="s2">also the the frustration with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.130" end="00:04:56.180" style="s2">resource-based economy conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.930" end="00:04:58.490" style="s2">where I get lost my sovereignty a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.180" end="00:05:01.250" style="s2">bit like what the your</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.490" end="00:05:03.230" style="s2">understandings a negative seven but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">was because it was beyond that partly it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.230" end="00:05:06.950" style="s2">was like wait is this person trolling or</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">do they really don&#39;t understand how can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.950" end="00:05:09.830" style="s2">they protect like they&#39;re like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:11.300" style="s2">spent hours and hours but like show me</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.830" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">one place he said that money isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">thing like how could you say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">watched Jacque fresco for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:18.350" style="s2">and not heard him say that money is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">the thing it&#39;s very different as I said</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.350" end="00:05:22.760" style="s2">to add on to resource-based economy like</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:24.290" style="s2">frenzy and common planet to and say we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.760" end="00:05:25.820" style="s2">understand it we don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.290" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">we need some kind of currency to deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.820" end="00:05:29.480" style="s2">with that first is like right humanity</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:31.490" style="s2">can&#39;t deal without a currency but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.480" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">not them it is them in the moment it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.490" end="00:05:34.130" style="s2">them it was like how dare you not</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:36.200" style="s2">understand it how do you think you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:38.690" style="s2">understand it but it also goes to show</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.200" end="00:05:39.470" style="s2">you that this beautiful I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.690" end="00:05:41.300" style="s2">beautiful idea of a future</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.470" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2">resource-based economy the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be implemented I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.650" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">is because it&#39;s needs to be global and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.000" style="s2">overarching and we don&#39;t even understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:50.120" style="s2">the implications before it&#39;s put into</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.000" end="00:05:52.310" style="s2">place but it&#39;s not even though that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.120" end="00:05:54.470" style="s2">like people&#39;s lack of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:05:56.630" style="s2">even when they hear about it even when</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.470" end="00:06:00.020" style="s2">they watch the documentary they still</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.630" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it and there is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.020" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">flaw there because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:03.950" style="s2">understand it and you can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:06.229" style="s2">beauty of that then you have people</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.950" end="00:06:06.889" style="s2">arguing without ever coming to the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.229" end="00:06:08.900" style="s2">consent</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.889" end="00:06:10.310" style="s2">and although I&#39;m not trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:12.349" style="s2">resource-based economy I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.310" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">create game be in a better world and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.349" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">think that is a resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:20.389" style="s2">I&#39;m not tied to that one there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:22.189" style="s2">of parallel between KBD and all of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.389" end="00:06:23.689" style="s2">like if you can&#39;t understand it how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.189" end="00:06:27.229" style="s2">you do it and game B has this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.689" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">simplicity of that just a language but</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.229" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">then it&#39;s like where&#39;s the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">and we need to like like focus in on</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.960" style="s2">what it is I&#39;m like that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">breaking what it is and although I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.960" end="00:06:39.110" style="s2">of the people who was one way and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:40.909" style="s2">like right it breaks it because it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.110" end="00:06:44.029" style="s2">the fact that we all have I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.909" end="00:06:45.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not but like in solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.029" end="00:06:46.909" style="s2">where we talk about what&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.319" end="00:06:48.229" style="s2">happening and then we give our version</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.909" end="00:06:49.849" style="s2">of the beautiful future that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.229" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">have to agree on and then we take the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.849" end="00:06:54.409" style="s2">step not to me is kind of game be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:06:56.330" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay so like we all agree like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.409" end="00:06:58.069" style="s2">we we agree there&#39;s something broke in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:07:00.169" style="s2">book game we might not agree what it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.069" end="00:07:02.930" style="s2">we have a different vision of what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.169" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">actually could be five ten no here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.930" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">let&#39;s not go a million I&#39;m in the future</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:11.210" style="s2">and just taking that step forward and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:13.250" style="s2">coming together and forming things is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.210" end="00:07:15.589" style="s2">like the adjacent possible and if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.250" end="00:07:17.300" style="s2">need it to be this huge everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.589" end="00:07:19.610" style="s2">switched over to resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.300" end="00:07:21.139" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be and like to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.610" end="00:07:22.279" style="s2">own I&#39;ll let you on one second Daniel if</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.569" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">whole process so so Daniel I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.529" end="00:07:48.129" style="s2">I mean honestly since about this time</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.370" end="00:07:53.750" style="s2">last year</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.129" end="00:07:57.439" style="s2">so I mean updates I worked I a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.750" end="00:08:01.189" style="s2">things on the pitch deck there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.439" end="00:08:03.050" style="s2">really a lot to change and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.189" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">based on my new experiences talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.050" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">other people so doing a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:16.009" style="s2">networking I got in touch with another a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:17.650" style="s2">business guy who he&#39;s got two small</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.009" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">businesses</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.650" end="00:08:24.370" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s pretty savvy on some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:27.220" style="s2">this stuff so I got in touch with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.370" end="00:08:30.130" style="s2">through a friend and this guy is good to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.220" end="00:08:33.820" style="s2">know because he has a network of angel</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.130" end="00:08:36.690" style="s2">investors as well that he&#39;s gonna put me</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:40.089" style="s2">in touch with so that&#39;s that&#39;s good news</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.690" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">I mean the hardest part probably and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.089" end="00:08:47.560" style="s2">this what I ran into last year is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">having any programmers on my team which</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.560" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">is pretty dangerous um but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:58.089" style="s2">gotta move forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:09:01.420" style="s2">um bit by bit so that&#39;s my update is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.089" end="00:09:08.620" style="s2">just doing more networking and making</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.420" end="00:09:10.180" style="s2">some progress there Daniel it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.620" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like I feel like I have nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">programmers on my project and that still</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:20.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help like it&#39;s okay didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">want to program your own thing terribly</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.470" end="00:09:25.350" style="s2">when they all have their own projects in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">their own idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.350" end="00:09:29.800" style="s2">needed this to be made and it&#39;s that bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:31.870" style="s2">energy also it&#39;s like okay how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.800" end="00:09:34.450" style="s2">to that point of this thing can now be</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.870" end="00:09:36.730" style="s2">coded and made and hire someone to do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.450" end="00:09:38.890" style="s2">but like feel the pro feel ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:41.950" style="s2">the process before and after once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.890" end="00:09:45.220" style="s2">me yeah it&#39;s no problem to pay to pay</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.950" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">programmers to build this thing but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.220" end="00:09:52.360" style="s2">get in this never-ending loop of if</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">something needs fixing or or changed you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.360" end="00:09:57.820" style="s2">know then you&#39;re still paying and like</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:10:02.770" style="s2">that&#39;s normal and that&#39;s okay but</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.820" end="00:10:05.020" style="s2">ideally you have someone who shares the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.770" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">vision who can also do the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.020" end="00:10:08.470" style="s2">they&#39;re like yeah I love that vision I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">mean the other challenge that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.470" end="00:10:15.310" style="s2">told the biggest thing as well as is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:17.800" style="s2">probably advertising and marketing so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.310" end="00:10:21.459" style="s2">like once this gets built I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.800" end="00:10:24.010" style="s2">probably do some kind of like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.459" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">know campaign or like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.010" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">podcast tour or something try to like</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">get on podcast show it off talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:37.540" style="s2">it get people to try it out or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:44.530" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re the name for your project</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.540" end="00:10:47.950" style="s2">Daniel ah this is a this is another the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.530" end="00:10:50.590" style="s2">name is not set in stone because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.950" end="00:10:54.820" style="s2">a marketer like I&#39;m nervous about</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.590" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">putting a name on it because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.820" end="00:11:00.460" style="s2">marketing problem we got you the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:03.250" style="s2">placeholder name you have a placeholder</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.460" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">name in the mean bar code name Pluto</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.250" end="00:11:12.450" style="s2">Pluto the planet we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:12.450" style="s2">planet or not all right I like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.510" end="00:11:26.260" style="s2">all right Mateus do you want to given an</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">update say morph planet just so my son</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">is watching all like everything about</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:33.310" style="s2">the cosmos right now so I know stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:37.530" style="s2">though when I was young it was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.310" end="00:11:37.530" style="s2">proper planet then it was degraded so</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.630" end="00:11:45.700" style="s2">I&#39;m still doing some bits and pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.150" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">actually show it but it&#39;s like it has</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.700" end="00:11:51.580" style="s2">proper like DNS and everything so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:55.480" style="s2">progress and then I have totally no idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.580" end="00:11:58.780" style="s2">where to go from that probably now in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.480" end="00:12:12.990" style="s2">angel in the source will be very good</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.780" end="00:12:12.990" style="s2">thing you see that&#39;s my GP update do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:16.960" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.250" end="00:12:19.230" style="s2">does anyone have an issue they&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.960" end="00:12:25.060" style="s2">be in the hot seat or would like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.230" end="00:12:28.630" style="s2">to work on or focus on you started</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.060" end="00:12:31.030" style="s2">talking about RBE it&#39;s today&#39;s meeting</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.630" end="00:12:34.089" style="s2">going to be about resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.030" end="00:12:36.550" style="s2">Oh necessarily you can open it up to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.089" end="00:12:38.290" style="s2">that though nobody else has anything we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.550" end="00:12:41.910" style="s2">can put resource-based economy in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.290" end="00:12:43.300" style="s2">hot seat talk about and talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.910" end="00:12:47.020" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.300" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">because yesterday my friends from</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.020" end="00:12:51.310" style="s2">zeitgeist because I apparently I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.790" end="00:12:54.940" style="s2">people from zeitgeist the Polish chapter</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.310" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">of it they&#39;re thinking about writing an</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.940" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">application for starting something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:07.090" style="s2">shared shared economy for basically it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:12.520" style="s2">would start with being able to borrow</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.090" end="00:13:16.990" style="s2">tools and physical items and share them</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.520" end="00:13:20.130" style="s2">among the community of whoever would</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.990" end="00:13:23.590" style="s2">want to join and participate in anything</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.130" end="00:13:28.150" style="s2">so the approach is to write an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.590" end="00:13:32.340" style="s2">application and then create some this</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.150" end="00:13:37.800" style="s2">used to be decided how to keep track of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.340" end="00:13:41.290" style="s2">like hours and items and have some</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.800" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">metrics not money of course but</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.290" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">something to keep track of how well</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.530" style="s2">expensive is not a good work because</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">to kind of like a formula question so</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:52.380" style="s2">that like it&#39;s the same question for for</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.620" end="00:17:06.660" style="s2">give more understanding for why all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.899" end="00:17:09.860" style="s2">them broke down their various like</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.660" end="00:17:09.860" style="s2">there&#39;s more data if it&#39;s formulated</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.760" end="00:17:14.429" style="s2">given some of the conversations you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.929" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">told me about that I think may have</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.429" end="00:17:19.260" style="s2">spawned that I wonder if it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:21.809" style="s2">conversation around what problems do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.260" end="00:17:23.459" style="s2">think can and can&#39;t solve and then if</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.809" end="00:17:25.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem tech can&#39;t solve look why</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.459" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">do you think that have you tried and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.500" end="00:17:29.790" style="s2">failed do you know somebody who tried</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:32.190" style="s2">and failed is there just something</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.790" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">innate with that thing or the technology</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:39.030" style="s2">that you think one I could fail yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:41.720" style="s2">mean I already know that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.030" end="00:17:44.070" style="s2">the waiter oh I don&#39;t need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.720" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s like there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.070" end="00:17:47.130" style="s2">amazing ideas and then it&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:48.510" style="s2">there were men of people there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.130" end="00:17:50.190" style="s2">enough funding we didn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.510" end="00:17:52.140" style="s2">business minds to actually make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.190" end="00:17:53.910" style="s2">business worthy but yeah having right</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.140" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">instead of putting out the call for like</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.910" end="00:17:56.549" style="s2">the one-on-one interview with the person</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:17:58.919" style="s2">who was in charge of it which is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.549" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">vulnerable you like hey it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.919" end="00:18:03.540" style="s2">periphery of I&#39;ve heard this one failed</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.020" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">right yeah or just you know a quick</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.540" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">two-minute like oh yeah I was on this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:11.490" style="s2">project that this happened this happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:13.410" style="s2">and I think it means X yeah cuz then</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.490" end="00:18:15.150" style="s2">yeah you aren&#39;t like spending 50 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.410" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">explaining like something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.150" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">embarrassed about</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:21.690" style="s2">yeah and that like that&#39;s so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:23.610" style="s2">understand it&#39;s our entire society but</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.690" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">that like like when you fail in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.610" end="00:18:28.410" style="s2">business you&#39;re a failure it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:30.030" style="s2">you learned stuff and if you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.410" end="00:18:33.480" style="s2">share that then the world learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.030" end="00:18:35.130" style="s2">something and especially in tech the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.480" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">thing probably still exists somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.130" end="00:18:38.580" style="s2">like it&#39;s like you actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:41.180" style="s2">even still have the code</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.580" end="00:18:44.520" style="s2">and whatever like it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.180" end="00:18:47.340" style="s2">phenomenon and yet we it&#39;s it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.520" end="00:18:49.740" style="s2">like the survivor bias that when someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.340" end="00:18:52.350" style="s2">makes it big so sitting with yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.740" end="00:18:54.120" style="s2">is is that makes it bigger like well if</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.350" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">you do what I did you will get to where</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.120" end="00:18:58.980" style="s2">I am right tony robbins although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:19:00.810" style="s2">like this is the the formula well no</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.980" end="00:19:02.760" style="s2">because if you took a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.810" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">they&#39;d exactly what you did no not all</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.760" end="00:19:06.120" style="s2">of them would be a success how many of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:08.670" style="s2">them would be a success is the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.120" end="00:19:11.580" style="s2">and then even out of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.670" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">succeed how many fail after and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.580" end="00:19:18.360" style="s2">something in that we like a look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:19.920" style="s2">people who and just probability-wise</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.360" end="00:19:21.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t succeed and like they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.920" end="00:19:22.890" style="s2">failure and then people who got the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.630" end="00:19:24.840" style="s2">periodic it&#39;s basically like won the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.890" end="00:19:26.610" style="s2">lottery then you&#39;re like telling you won</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:28.050" style="s2">the lottery all you have to do is buy a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:30.810" style="s2">lottery ticket and then you wait the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.050" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">right numbers it&#39;s like oh so right</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.810" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">place right time right angel investor</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:37.170" style="s2">right connections and and luck out that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:38.100" style="s2">the market was ready for it at the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.170" end="00:19:45.060" style="s2">time gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.100" end="00:19:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard let&#39;s just do that yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.060" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">think for a lot of host people ended up</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.310" end="00:19:50.760" style="s2">being tough because they usually did do</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:53.250" style="s2">a lot of hard work it&#39;s a yeah but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.760" end="00:19:56.190" style="s2">of people do hard work and fail that&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.250" end="00:19:58.050" style="s2">mean hard work doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.190" end="00:20:00.270" style="s2">it&#39;s something will succeed or fail it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:20:01.590" style="s2">almost irrelevant one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.270" end="00:20:03.870" style="s2">like as long as the work that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.590" end="00:20:07.940" style="s2">get done gets done you can still be you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.870" end="00:20:07.940" style="s2">know working hard in the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.810" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">depends on how you define success too</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.730" end="00:20:22.050" style="s2">right like if my if success to me is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">just getting a platform up and going</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.050" end="00:20:29.160" style="s2">then i had success if my success is only</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:35.060" style="s2">defined by having a million users then</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.160" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve just like raised the bar a lot so</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.060" end="00:20:43.860" style="s2">something to think about um but to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:51.770" style="s2">back to what Martius is it Martius or</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:56.659" style="s2">marcus much my church was saying um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.770" end="00:21:00.860" style="s2">I on the resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.659" end="00:21:03.620" style="s2">type of application so there are a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.860" end="00:21:06.350" style="s2">couple different folks I guess out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.620" end="00:21:09.590" style="s2">some apps I&#39;ve seen in the Android App</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.350" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">Store that are designed for lending and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.590" end="00:21:19.730" style="s2">borrowing of items and like two of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">worked okay there was one that I found</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.730" end="00:21:26.809" style="s2">the website that looked like it was very</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">very good but it had like died out it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.809" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">was one of these like they got it off</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">the ground they got it going and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:35.750" style="s2">who knows but I you know I&#39;d have to dig</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:37.549" style="s2">through to reference it but it was one</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.750" end="00:21:39.169" style="s2">of these that got going maybe they had</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.549" end="00:21:39.980" style="s2">no users and then they ran out of money</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.169" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.980" end="00:21:50.090" style="s2">it looked well done the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:53.320" style="s2">things that I have seen as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.090" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">with all of the ones I&#39;ve observed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.320" end="00:22:00.830" style="s2">this is a little bit of a question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:22:04.820" style="s2">like can technology actually solve our</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.830" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">problems I think that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.820" end="00:22:10.700" style="s2">replacement for relationships the main</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:13.309" style="s2">people that I&#39;m probably gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.700" end="00:22:16.850" style="s2">if this is to work the main people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.309" end="00:22:20.270" style="s2">probably going to want to borrow and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">have a tool library with are the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.270" end="00:22:27.289" style="s2">who live closest to me and if I just</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:30.110" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna go on an app and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.289" end="00:22:33.110" style="s2">going to give me a better relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.110" end="00:22:39.710" style="s2">with the people that live near me like</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.110" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not likely to do that so an</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.710" end="00:22:49.610" style="s2">app can&#39;t solve every part of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">relationship part of this right and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.610" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">the the other thing and maybe you can if</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:56.179" style="s2">you&#39;re working with these folks maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">take this with you what I have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.179" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">on all these tool library and borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:04.380" style="s2">lending apps is they are they have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:08.280" style="s2">privacy</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.380" end="00:23:11.809" style="s2">um I haven&#39;t seen one like some of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.280" end="00:23:14.940" style="s2">are geo based and so like I can load up</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.809" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">things that I own tools that I own in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.940" end="00:23:22.169" style="s2">the app and even if I&#39;m using a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:24.059" style="s2">pseudonym people anyone can see that and</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.059" end="00:23:31.289" style="s2">live in a geo I need it to work like</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.620" end="00:23:35.210" style="s2">more like Google Drive I need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.289" end="00:23:39.650" style="s2">to load up my tool library and then have</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.210" end="00:23:42.659" style="s2">specific control over who sees what um</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.650" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a let&#39;s say I just have</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:04.200" style="s2">lending out my ladder to some people but</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.890" end="00:24:07.080" style="s2">then I&#39;ve got a power washer which needs</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.200" end="00:24:09.750" style="s2">a little bit more care I don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.080" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">visible by my whole network maybe I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:18.419" style="s2">them with that thing the idea that all</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.650" end="00:24:20.220" style="s2">all the people in my network should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.419" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">able to see all the things that I own I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.220" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">think has been well is personal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:29.429" style="s2">been that I can&#39;t use these apps because</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.130" end="00:24:32.940" style="s2">they just lump everything together these</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.429" end="00:24:35.010" style="s2">terms of view ability and I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.940" end="00:24:37.740" style="s2">have no I need fine-tuned control Google</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.010" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">Drive doesn&#39;t just make all my documents</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.740" end="00:24:42.419" style="s2">open everyone I have fine-tuned control</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a sensitive document only I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.419" end="00:24:50.970" style="s2">share this with this person etc if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:53.610" style="s2">have any influence close to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.970" end="00:24:57.630" style="s2">thinking we need the fine-tuned control</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.610" end="00:24:59.820" style="s2">I think for it to work and then so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.630" end="00:25:03.539" style="s2">folks can respond I&#39;d love to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.820" end="00:25:06.929" style="s2">conversation about why it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.539" end="00:25:09.929" style="s2">income-generating this is my personal</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.929" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">understanding of game be well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.929" end="00:25:18.269" style="s2">to like well it&#39;s supposed to compete um</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:21.570" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know about you but</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.269" end="00:25:24.989" style="s2">like if I had something going and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.570" end="00:25:29.339" style="s2">drained all my resources my monetary</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.989" end="00:25:30.989" style="s2">resources it&#39;s not competing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.339" end="00:25:33.929" style="s2">supposed to compete better which</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.989" end="00:25:36.299" style="s2">Dutchman&#39;s we&#39;re supposed I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.929" end="00:25:38.909" style="s2">thing i saw from daniel sh montón burger</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.299" end="00:25:43.049" style="s2">is like we need to design things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.909" end="00:25:46.289" style="s2">put energy into stuff that we like</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.049" end="00:25:47.940" style="s2">so things that are non predatory or</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.289" end="00:25:49.950" style="s2">aren&#39;t harming the environment or</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.940" end="00:25:52.829" style="s2">whatever we need to create these things</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.950" end="00:25:54.209" style="s2">so I can shift my monetary resources and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.829" end="00:25:57.089" style="s2">start to put them in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.209" end="00:25:59.609" style="s2">instead of that direction that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.089" end="00:26:05.579" style="s2">how I see it so these folks can do their</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.609" end="00:26:09.329" style="s2">app however they want if if I&#39;m lending</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.579" end="00:26:12.179" style="s2">out my power washer maybe I have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.329" end="00:26:14.609" style="s2">little checkbox under there that I leave</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.179" end="00:26:17.429" style="s2">off if it&#39;s free but maybe I checked</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.609" end="00:26:21.119" style="s2">that box and I say actually this has</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.429" end="00:26:22.979" style="s2">wear and tear and if you borrow this</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.119" end="00:26:25.759" style="s2">from me it&#39;s like $3.00 a day or</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.979" end="00:26:29.669" style="s2">something like I don&#39;t see that as being</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.759" end="00:26:32.629" style="s2">predatory I see that as just stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.669" end="00:26:35.820" style="s2">breaks down and needs maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.629" end="00:26:39.479" style="s2">something think about yeah and that also</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.820" end="00:26:41.129" style="s2">helps give a like a little bit of I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.479" end="00:26:43.649" style="s2">don&#39;t of scarcity is the right word but</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.129" end="00:26:46.499" style="s2">something like if 10 people want it who</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.649" end="00:26:47.879" style="s2">gets it is it just who who asks first</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.499" end="00:26:49.499" style="s2">will keep up what if they can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.879" end="00:26:51.599" style="s2">there for a week like there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.499" end="00:26:52.919" style="s2">things of how do you manage it and cost</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.599" end="00:26:54.749" style="s2">I think it&#39;s something that does help</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.919" end="00:26:56.369" style="s2">with that and then what you know things</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.749" end="00:26:58.200" style="s2">break so what happens if you lend this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.369" end="00:26:58.709" style="s2">thing out 20 times in the 20th time it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.200" end="00:27:00.539" style="s2">breaks</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.709" end="00:27:03.239" style="s2">well now that&#39;s costing you money and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.539" end="00:27:05.579" style="s2">you got yeah nothing to help pay for</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.239" end="00:27:08.669" style="s2">your new one like it&#39;s not to to to to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.579" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">say that I you said it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.669" end="00:27:12.329" style="s2">predatory you shouldn&#39;t be trying to buy</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:14.399" style="s2">a new power washer every three rentals</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.329" end="00:27:16.499" style="s2">because you can afford because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.399" end="00:27:17.940" style="s2">expensive but enough that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.499" end="00:27:19.019" style="s2">you lived it up ten times and it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.940" end="00:27:21.239" style="s2">you&#39;re like all right well at least I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.019" end="00:27:22.979" style="s2">got something to help pay for the next</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.239" end="00:27:25.859" style="s2">one it wasn&#39;t in perfect condition to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.979" end="00:27:28.379" style="s2">start with so that&#39;s not not too bad I</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.859" end="00:27:31.619" style="s2">think you would also need profiles for</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.379" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">the people borrowing to say you know how</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.619" end="00:27:34.310" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:36.290" style="s2">this person treat things because some</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.310" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">people just it&#39;s in their genes that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.290" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">they just don&#39;t give a about</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:40.730" style="s2">objects you just see how they treat even</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:42.500" style="s2">their own stuff and other people&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.730" end="00:27:45.020" style="s2">they just don&#39;t care they&#39;ll you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.500" end="00:27:46.340" style="s2">throw stuff on the ground they&#39;ll not do</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.020" end="00:27:54.500" style="s2">proper maintenance steps and other</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.340" end="00:27:55.940" style="s2">people are meticulous sure what about</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.500" end="00:27:57.470" style="s2">the site guys like zeitgeist has enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.940" end="00:27:58.790" style="s2">people that they could have a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.470" end="00:28:00.710" style="s2">but if it&#39;s someone in the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.790" end="00:28:02.390" style="s2">movement like I mean guess I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.710" end="00:28:03.830" style="s2">zeitgeist movement he was making it a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.390" end="00:28:05.600" style="s2">side app and it&#39;s not going through</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.830" end="00:28:07.040" style="s2">Peter Joseph and it&#39;s not then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:08.450" style="s2">gonna have all the same problems than</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.040" end="00:28:11.650" style="s2">every other tool library has but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.450" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">issue is we all have different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.650" end="00:28:16.670" style="s2">why we would or wouldn&#39;t put our tools</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:18.500" style="s2">on there and different reasons why we</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.670" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t use it as it&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.500" end="00:28:20.690" style="s2">create something from the ground up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">say so we can have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.690" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">and say yeah you know with Daniels idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:29.060" style="s2">of having things visible to different</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.800" end="00:29:23.870" style="s2">sounds like an amazing idea but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:25.310" style="s2">gonna be something about that for</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.870" end="00:29:26.900" style="s2">someone else it&#39;s like oh wait I have to</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.810" end="00:29:42.530" style="s2">little more technical skill I can put</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.010" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">them in and cater to that and someone</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.370" end="00:29:53.210" style="s2">to prove that and and you know I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.010" end="00:29:54.590" style="s2">wear and tear money back and someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.210" end="00:29:57.889" style="s2">else doesn&#39;t want weird share money back</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.590" end="00:30:03.559" style="s2">and figuring out or actual solid genes</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.130" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">exists this type of app existed I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:31.340" style="s2">it would be so useful that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:34.549" style="s2">would have it like even if you just used</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.340" end="00:30:37.730" style="s2">it in your own family like this is like</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.710" end="00:30:56.750" style="s2">useful well I think it would encourage</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.940" end="00:31:01.429" style="s2">me to build more relationships with my</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.750" end="00:31:05.149" style="s2">neighbors because there&#39;s more there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.429" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">even more value and meaning in those</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.149" end="00:31:12.230" style="s2">relationships I&#39;m not the type of person</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:15.799" style="s2">that likes to just search on mean even</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.230" end="00:31:19.100" style="s2">Craigslist I&#39;d rather see if a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.799" end="00:31:24.529" style="s2">mine has something that I want or need</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.100" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">or whatever then search on a like a kind</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.340" end="00:31:53.870" style="s2">you&#39;re so right that some people would</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.350" end="00:31:56.899" style="s2">have a different level of comfortability</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:31:59.660" style="s2">they could make some of their items like</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.899" end="00:32:01.610" style="s2">publicly visible like no</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.660" end="00:32:08.270" style="s2">I would do that but you know cheers to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.610" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">the people that do yeah I wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.270" end="00:32:13.400" style="s2">could almost make it like both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:15.320" style="s2">the sort of Craigslist outlook where you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.400" end="00:32:17.420" style="s2">can go on and say I have this to sell</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.320" end="00:32:18.860" style="s2">and you can go on and say I want this if</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.420" end="00:32:21.260" style="s2">you could kind of do both like if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.860" end="00:32:23.300" style="s2">needed a power washer you could say hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.260" end="00:32:24.710" style="s2">I need a power washer and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.300" end="00:32:26.690" style="s2">see if anybody has it publicly shared</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.710" end="00:32:28.400" style="s2">and if they do cool you you might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.690" end="00:32:30.140" style="s2">able to see that in ping them but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.400" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">if you have a power washer and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.140" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">shared you might see the the request</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:35.060" style="s2">though and then if it&#39;s your next-door</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.130" end="00:32:51.230" style="s2">with that or not it&#39;s up to you because</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:53.990" style="s2">they don&#39;t know you have mm-hmm also and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.230" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">most do I think most cities that start</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.990" end="00:32:57.410" style="s2">to a libraries end up branching out but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:33:00.620" style="s2">they start with just the tool library</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.410" end="00:33:02.060" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.620" end="00:33:03.860" style="s2">have access to to a library but I use</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.060" end="00:33:05.090" style="s2">them so infrequently it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.860" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">sense for me to be a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.090" end="00:33:08.660" style="s2">Vancouver to a library because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:11.870" style="s2">like a monthly no no there&#39;s a yearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.660" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">fee and such what I would use is is more</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.870" end="00:33:15.890" style="s2">of like a kitchen gadget one right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.720" style="s2">oh I want to try bread maker or I want</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.890" end="00:33:19.790" style="s2">to try this new thing before trying it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.720" end="00:33:21.170" style="s2">so that I&#39;m not spending $400 on</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.790" end="00:33:23.450" style="s2">something before it before I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.170" end="00:33:25.340" style="s2">it&#39;s liable to have a I don&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.450" end="00:33:26.810" style="s2">decorations or party centrality party</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.340" end="00:33:29.390" style="s2">planning but to have reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.810" end="00:33:30.560" style="s2">decorations and cut and plates and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.390" end="00:33:33.020" style="s2">that you can be dropped off and picked</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.560" end="00:33:34.370" style="s2">up til to actually problem-solve stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.020" end="00:33:35.750" style="s2">together to say hey where&#39;s our waste</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:37.850" style="s2">coming from where&#39;s it going how could</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.750" end="00:33:39.830" style="s2">be like coordinate on this even having</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.850" end="00:33:41.150" style="s2">something like people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.830" end="00:33:42.980" style="s2">into tools and have their own power</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.150" end="00:33:44.870" style="s2">tools but having the odd other tool they</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.980" end="00:33:46.400" style="s2">need having them have a buyer&#39;s club</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.870" end="00:33:47.930" style="s2">right of like okay we&#39;re all gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.400" end="00:33:49.250" style="s2">in 50 bucks a month because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.930" end="00:33:50.900" style="s2">we put on tools anyway and then we get</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.250" end="00:33:54.010" style="s2">by the big tools that we all don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.900" end="00:33:56.600" style="s2">like and that would be more more just</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.010" end="00:33:58.310" style="s2">transparent right your your you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.600" end="00:34:00.110" style="s2">your level you know you have the skill</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.310" end="00:34:01.070" style="s2">level of both being able to use it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.110" end="00:34:03.920" style="s2">hopefully be able to do the wear and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.070" end="00:34:05.090" style="s2">tear on it and voting on what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.920" end="00:34:07.250" style="s2">what you&#39;re gonna buy with that honey</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.090" end="00:34:09.020" style="s2">and putting on that system there&#39;s tons</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.250" end="00:34:12.340" style="s2">of ways to deal with it and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.020" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">an app doesn&#39;t solve the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.340" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">possibility it</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:17.929" style="s2">it&#39;s like one person&#39;s idea or a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.599" style="s2">other things and then if it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.929" end="00:34:23.240" style="s2">for you it&#39;s broken and so then yes this</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.599" end="00:34:24.740" style="s2">is a great idea and literally dozens and</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">people want to put their stuff on there</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.790" end="00:35:08.630" style="s2">more people want to use it what how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.840" style="s2">we build that trust in into it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.630" end="00:35:13.849" style="s2">creating it from the from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.840" end="00:35:15.770" style="s2">including things like hey Vancouver has</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.849" end="00:35:17.000" style="s2">a Tool Library why are we recreating</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.770" end="00:35:20.330" style="s2">this from scratch how can we coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.000" end="00:35:22.369" style="s2">with them brings together and give them</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.330" end="00:35:25.220" style="s2">software that helps them and people can</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.369" end="00:35:27.109" style="s2">put those in is is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.220" end="00:35:29.000" style="s2">like constantly trying to start</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.109" end="00:35:31.609" style="s2">everything from scratch which we know is</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.000" end="00:35:33.770" style="s2">fun but it&#39;s like yeah this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.609" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">has restarted from scratches but what</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.770" end="00:35:38.570" style="s2">humans kind of want to do in their own I</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">mean my idea for two libraries I could</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.570" end="00:35:43.430" style="s2">literally put anything on there like I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:47.330" style="s2">could put the smallest little</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.430" end="00:35:50.450" style="s2">knick-knack and like that&#39;s okay but</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.330" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">some folks want it like well just tools</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.450" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but that that&#39;s a good I I</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:58.609" style="s2">would love to be able to be in touch</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:01.670" style="s2">with the people who have already built</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.609" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">some of this stuff to a pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.670" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">workable degree an app that does most of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">everything and just be like hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">can you put a calendar on this I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">some I&#39;ve seen some that work almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.950" style="s2">exactly how you&#39;d think they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:18.950" style="s2">the privacy part that I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.950" end="00:36:21.080" style="s2">earlier but they just when someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.950" end="00:36:23.420" style="s2">checks out an item and I lend it out</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.080" end="00:36:26.990" style="s2">there&#39;s no calendar I want it to like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">ping me I want to be able to say all</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.990" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:33.559" style="s2">three weeks remind me that my friend</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.020" end="00:36:36.109" style="s2">so-and-so has this book cuz I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.559" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">forget and please have it ping both of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.109" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">us to say hey you you know you could set</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:43.339" style="s2">it for three weeks or three months or</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:45.980" style="s2">whatever but so one of them worked</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.339" end="00:36:49.220" style="s2">really great just know calendar like man</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.980" end="00:36:51.349" style="s2">when I check this out put help let me</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.220" end="00:36:52.940" style="s2">put a reminder in so I loved it yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.349" end="00:36:56.540" style="s2">love to be able to talk to the folks</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.940" end="00:37:00.980" style="s2">that are so talented and already have</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.540" end="00:37:02.750" style="s2">built so much of this things for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.980" end="00:37:04.970" style="s2">although I want to calendar basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.750" end="00:37:07.490" style="s2">anything and everything for that account</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.970" end="00:37:09.230" style="s2">unlike a calendar because if I&#39;m not you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.490" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">know if I&#39;m not a library and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.230" end="00:37:13.369" style="s2">I&#39;m really using my friends storage to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:15.079" style="s2">some degree right so what I want is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.369" end="00:37:17.300" style="s2">be able to look up my inventory you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.079" end="00:37:19.400" style="s2">who has it right I don&#39;t care if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.300" end="00:37:20.990" style="s2">have it for a week or a year as long as</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:23.030" style="s2">I know you still have it and they can</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.990" end="00:37:28.280" style="s2">also look it up and be like wait what</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.030" end="00:37:29.900" style="s2">did I borrow this from I&#39;ve lent out so</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.280" end="00:37:31.970" style="s2">many books and now I&#39;m at the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.900" end="00:37:35.559" style="s2">where I&#39;m like I&#39;ll never remember who</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.970" end="00:37:38.210" style="s2">has what anymore and like I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.559" end="00:37:40.940" style="s2">happy to do that but I wish I could just</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.210" end="00:37:42.920" style="s2">see because who knows it might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.940" end="00:37:46.190" style="s2">collecting dust and someone else needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.920" end="00:37:48.950" style="s2">that book now or something and that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.190" end="00:37:51.049" style="s2">is like in my mind it works different</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.950" end="00:37:52.569" style="s2">which is even like our different</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.049" end="00:37:54.500" style="s2">versions we have completely different</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.569" end="00:37:56.270" style="s2">applications at the end but if we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.500" end="00:37:58.760" style="s2">able to coordinate on the base then we</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.270" end="00:38:00.710" style="s2">can include them in in the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.760" end="00:38:02.809" style="s2">because what if I want if I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.710" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">who has it but now the next person wants</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.809" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">it well they can say hey I want this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:08.630" style="s2">book and oh I have that book but but</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:10.280" style="s2">todd has it well I can ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.630" end="00:38:11.780" style="s2">and Todd gets a ping of like hey are you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.280" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">using it or can you pass it off to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.780" end="00:38:16.339" style="s2">next person can you finish it within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:18.470" style="s2">next week like that it&#39;s instead of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.339" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">having a central inventory like to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.470" end="00:38:21.799" style="s2">library does right well they&#39;re sending</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.049" style="s2">things out and coming back having it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.799" end="00:38:26.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s dispersed but it&#39;s like who</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.049" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">has it at the moment and they can even</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.270" end="00:38:29.569" style="s2">possibly lend it out to other people if</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">they know that I trust them right like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.569" end="00:38:33.380" style="s2">clearly I wouldn&#39;t lend out Daniels tool</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:34.700" style="s2">to the next person because he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.380" end="00:38:37.309" style="s2">want it to go to someone he doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.700" end="00:38:39.160" style="s2">and and having that be more information</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.309" end="00:38:41.329" style="s2">that we have in the end the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.160" end="00:38:44.450" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.329" end="00:38:48.979" style="s2">or even make it because what was</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.450" end="00:38:52.789" style="s2">discussed is more like pool of resources</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.979" end="00:38:58.630" style="s2">and tools that do not necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.789" end="00:39:03.170" style="s2">an owner the system owns stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.630" end="00:39:07.309" style="s2">in some smart way is able to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.170" end="00:39:10.670" style="s2">and fulfill needs of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.309" end="00:39:15.410" style="s2">participate in the system and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.670" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">it kind of on one hand easier too</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.410" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">because if this isn&#39;t all the tool then</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:24.979" style="s2">the system is able to decide who out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:28.430" style="s2">ten people who want it right now who can</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.979" end="00:39:31.130" style="s2">have it at the moment and then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.430" end="00:39:34.819" style="s2">treated of course and it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.130" end="00:39:39.529" style="s2">found right in it but yeah that was the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.819" end="00:39:43.969" style="s2">the approach and then it&#39;ll start only</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.529" end="00:39:46.249" style="s2">because really the tools are not what</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.969" end="00:39:49.160" style="s2">the system is about the system is about</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.249" end="00:39:53.029" style="s2">needs and for example if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.160" end="00:39:55.759" style="s2">borrow a drill driller</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.029" end="00:40:00.709" style="s2">what I need is not the tool what I need</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.759" end="00:40:03.499" style="s2">is a hole in the wall right so that was</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.709" end="00:40:06.979" style="s2">an enlightening sometimes I once heard</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.499" end="00:40:09.829" style="s2">that&#39;s I buy a tool it&#39;s not the two I</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.979" end="00:40:11.749" style="s2">need it&#39;s something else it&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.829" end="00:40:16.029" style="s2">need that can be fulfilled with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.749" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">tool but maybe there are smarter ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.029" end="00:40:20.589" style="s2">just giving me what I want but they</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:23.630" style="s2">really want instead of giving me some</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.589" end="00:40:27.529" style="s2">physical objects that I can do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.630" end="00:40:32.690" style="s2">with so yeah have been tracking all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.529" end="00:40:37.190" style="s2">resources engaged in me doing what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.690" end="00:40:40.130" style="s2">want and the end goal is to make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.190" end="00:40:44.239" style="s2">smarter and make it better and make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.130" end="00:40:46.729" style="s2">so the resources used in the system are</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.239" end="00:40:50.299" style="s2">equal to the resources that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.729" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">available because that&#39;s the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.299" end="00:40:55.240" style="s2">about this planet we have some finite</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:58.579" style="s2">amount of resources and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.240" end="00:41:01.819" style="s2">what we are doing right now it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.579" end="00:41:05.750" style="s2">using them and that&#39;s the problem but of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.819" end="00:41:07.700" style="s2">course that&#39;s for the next maybe right</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.750" end="00:41:09.819" style="s2">now uh one more thing I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.700" end="00:41:09.819" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:15.230" style="s2">it starts with tools and starts with</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.799" end="00:41:18.130" style="s2">landing borrowing or just passing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.230" end="00:41:22.250" style="s2">around but what is also involved</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.130" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">precisely as you go as you start a local</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.250" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">community being engaged in just so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.930" end="00:41:50.359" style="s2">what&#39;s also involved in local</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.869" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">communities there are also people who</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.359" end="00:41:57.130" style="s2">like to fix stuff and idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:42:00.950" style="s2">hackerspaces and maker spaces as in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.130" end="00:42:05.900" style="s2">places that can serve as storage spaces</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.950" end="00:42:08.569" style="s2">and garages and places where people can</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.900" end="00:42:13.250" style="s2">meet and technically minded people can</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.569" end="00:42:20.170" style="s2">meet and do stuff which I heard as in at</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.250" end="00:42:20.170" style="s2">least one country it&#39;s a good finger and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.230" end="00:42:27.230" style="s2">there are a lot of when I was young I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.030" end="00:42:34.460" style="s2">also read always into some technical</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.230" end="00:42:36.559" style="s2">things and gadgets so if I had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.460" end="00:42:39.950" style="s2">community of people who could teach me</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.559" end="00:42:44.299" style="s2">things and how to fix things it will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.950" end="00:42:48.049" style="s2">played and I know more people like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.299" end="00:42:52.299" style="s2">who&#39;d like to participate and have fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.049" end="00:43:00.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve stopped like drillers and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.299" end="00:43:04.819" style="s2">enters in some space which then you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.559" end="00:43:07.490" style="s2">it would create out of those elements it</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.819" end="00:43:08.120" style="s2">would create the basis for the new</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.490" end="00:43:15.340" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.120" end="00:43:17.990" style="s2">right yeah I&#39;m a cultic a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.340" end="00:43:22.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea that it starts with just</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.990" end="00:43:25.640" style="s2">simple passing items around but then</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.060" end="00:43:34.280" style="s2">what is involved are people relations</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.640" end="00:43:38.510" style="s2">which technology can facilitate and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.280" end="00:43:40.460" style="s2">body can cause them to appear but you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.510" end="00:43:44.120" style="s2">know relations are the most important</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.460" end="00:43:47.990" style="s2">thing so there are some common points</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.120" end="00:43:51.470" style="s2">like fixing stuff and then people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.990" end="00:43:53.180" style="s2">come along and they don&#39;t think I get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.470" end="00:44:02.180" style="s2">know each other and they build community</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.180" end="00:44:05.390" style="s2">which is really love the idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.180" end="00:44:09.050" style="s2">you in in this system if you put a value</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.390" end="00:44:12.050" style="s2">on every item then you could build in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.050" end="00:44:14.540" style="s2">way in which every time it changed hands</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.050" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">you could be tracking all that value</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.540" end="00:44:20.930" style="s2">like valued material saved or like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:23.690" style="s2">know every hammer is ten dollars and if</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.930" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">it changed hands a hundred times you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.690" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">know you&#39;re you&#39;re adding up all that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:31.940" style="s2">wealth that was saved or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:34.310" style="s2">call it and then secondly I&#39;d yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.940" end="00:44:37.370" style="s2">just love I love the idea that what if</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.310" end="00:44:43.180" style="s2">you had a whole tab in there which was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.370" end="00:44:45.320" style="s2">skills or services to be lent out and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.180" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve all got these different</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.320" end="00:44:52.460" style="s2">skills and I don&#39;t just need to borrow</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:54.890" style="s2">things but I I need I can&#39;t do my</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.460" end="00:44:59.120" style="s2">plumbing and like you know does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.890" end="00:45:00.110" style="s2">want to lend out their time if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.120" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">already had its custom this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.110" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">comprehensive it almost makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:07.970" style="s2">have a section a skill library its skill</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:11.210" style="s2">library right yeah I think so build on</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.970" end="00:45:12.680" style="s2">something you mentioned earlier Danielle</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.210" end="00:45:14.180" style="s2">would like you might not want to lend</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.680" end="00:45:16.190" style="s2">out your power washer to somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.180" end="00:45:17.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a certain skill well if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.190" end="00:45:19.700" style="s2">set up something like a makerspace</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.600" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">unless you have a table saw do you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.700" end="00:45:23.400" style="s2">want anyone off the street</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:26.730" style="s2">able to come and use a table saw that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.400" end="00:45:28.680" style="s2">sounds like a possible legal issue you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.730" end="00:45:29.970" style="s2">you might have to have it steel in order</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.680" end="00:45:32.099" style="s2">to be able to use certain things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.970" end="00:45:34.049" style="s2">hey we have a maker space for an auto</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.099" end="00:45:35.130" style="s2">shop you need these skills to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.049" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">come in there and use it or you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.130" end="00:45:38.130" style="s2">book it because we don&#39;t want you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.799" style="s2">crushing yourself to death with a car</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.130" end="00:45:43.470" style="s2">just in general and where you know where</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.799" end="00:45:45.450" style="s2">your people can see what&#39;s this I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.470" end="00:45:50.489" style="s2">want to mention I love it we&#39;ve put a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.450" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">mythical project but I think if there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.489" end="00:45:57.749" style="s2">something so um like when you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:59.369" style="s2">tool library its Omni when the number of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.749" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">people that are involved its Omni when</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.369" end="00:46:02.039" style="s2">the number of tools that are involved</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:04.230" style="s2">what&#39;s not Omni win or the number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.039" end="00:46:06.359" style="s2">applications involved right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.230" end="00:46:08.279" style="s2">everyone knows no complication is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.359" end="00:46:09.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s like everyone oh I got a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.279" end="00:46:10.499" style="s2">really an idea and they want to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.480" end="00:46:12.779" style="s2">it and they want to create it they want</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.499" end="00:46:16.019" style="s2">to create it and yet there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.779" end="00:46:19.319" style="s2">about like can we solve something that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.019" end="00:46:22.920" style="s2">is a need now right like Daniel has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.319" end="00:46:24.749" style="s2">need to keep an inventory so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.920" end="00:46:26.069" style="s2">a way to create something that he could</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.749" end="00:46:26.489" style="s2">use as an inventory I could use as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.069" end="00:46:28.980" style="s2">inventory</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.489" end="00:46:30.210" style="s2">even if we&#39;re the only one on there it</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.980" end="00:46:32.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because I&#39;m using it as</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.210" end="00:46:34.259" style="s2">my inventory right like there&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.069" end="00:46:36.299" style="s2">to solve that could be that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.259" end="00:46:37.589" style="s2">necessarily like dissipating the energy</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.299" end="00:46:39.180" style="s2">but they still are because I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.589" end="00:46:40.049" style="s2">application that does your inventory and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.180" end="00:46:41.999" style="s2">does everything we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.049" end="00:46:44.970" style="s2">would be amazing in it but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.999" end="00:46:47.749" style="s2">all these things like maker spaces um</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.970" end="00:46:50.009" style="s2">you can&#39;t have too many maker spaces</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.749" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">besides rent right like if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.009" end="00:46:52.470" style="s2">pay for rent but if it&#39;s in your garage</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:54.569" style="s2">and you&#39;re like you know what I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.470" end="00:46:56.220" style="s2">some neighbors to come over and work</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.569" end="00:46:57.869" style="s2">with but I don&#39;t want just anyone I want</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.220" end="00:47:00.890" style="s2">people to certain skill set like they</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.869" end="00:47:04.619" style="s2">put in stuff in there like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.890" end="00:47:06.779" style="s2">resources that are Omni win resources</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.619" end="00:47:09.569" style="s2">that aren&#39;t and figuring out how to like</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.779" end="00:47:13.589" style="s2">start with an omni win premise of can</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.569" end="00:47:15.779" style="s2">this technology offer something that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.589" end="00:47:18.989" style="s2">other ones ones have not and is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.779" end="00:47:27.569" style="s2">powerful enough to bring in people</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.989" end="00:47:31.319" style="s2">without a threshold of users I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.569" end="00:47:33.390" style="s2">is this next thing did gets a bit into</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.319" end="00:47:34.990" style="s2">to to gaming but to build on what Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.390" end="00:47:38.590" style="s2">talked about with like the you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.990" end="00:47:40.090" style="s2">you could you know like actually offer</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.590" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">up a skill right like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.090" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">carpenter or a plumber or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:47.170" style="s2">say I can do this thing hey hey can you</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:49.090" style="s2">help me I think the assumption there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.170" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of it to be like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.090" end="00:47:53.020" style="s2">a person&#39;s time you know free or or</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:55.090" style="s2">donated but having kind of like a pre</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.020" end="00:47:57.270" style="s2">free option where if it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.090" end="00:47:59.530" style="s2">you&#39;re a plumber or you&#39;re a maid or</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.270" end="00:48:01.540" style="s2">whatever it is that you can offer a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.530" end="00:48:03.369" style="s2">service and if you can hit a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.540" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">in a certain spot like so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.369" end="00:48:07.690" style="s2">you&#39;re a maid and you can get ten people</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:09.820" style="s2">in the same apartment building to agree</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.690" end="00:48:13.960" style="s2">on a day of the week for cleaning then</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.820" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">you can you know do $32 you know for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.960" end="00:48:16.660" style="s2">certain period of time instead of fifty</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:18.220" style="s2">because then you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.660" end="00:48:20.110" style="s2">about travel and finding people and blah</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.220" end="00:48:22.750" style="s2">blah blah so the day end of getting it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.110" end="00:48:26.110" style="s2">for cheaper and as a person providing</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.750" end="00:48:28.750" style="s2">the work you get you know a more stable</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.110" end="00:48:31.720" style="s2">form of income because it&#39;s helping you</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.750" end="00:48:33.820" style="s2">find customers and it&#39;s sort of grouping</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.720" end="00:48:36.520" style="s2">them together in a way that helps them</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.820" end="00:48:38.619" style="s2">save they help them save money but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.520" end="00:48:42.369" style="s2">also makes your life easier in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.619" end="00:48:44.590" style="s2">ways ask us since we already have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.369" end="00:48:47.070" style="s2">mythical one in the hot seat this</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.590" end="00:48:49.480" style="s2">process right that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.070" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">none of us are holding this project this</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.480" end="00:48:55.390" style="s2">is an hour project does this feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">different there&#39;s like a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.390" end="00:48:59.320" style="s2">quality that I don&#39;t care if I agree or</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:01.540" style="s2">disagree with you there&#39;s one we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.320" end="00:49:04.180" style="s2">making it but also there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.540" end="00:49:06.550" style="s2">quality to like I didn&#39;t come into this</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.180" end="00:49:08.320" style="s2">with with I&#39;ve put all this time energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.550" end="00:49:09.880" style="s2">into creating it to a library and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.320" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2">done this work and like it better be my</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.880" end="00:49:16.300" style="s2">way even if I open to openness they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:18.430" style="s2">still gonna be that subconscious bias</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.300" end="00:49:20.230" style="s2">and all of that like oh this undoes the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.430" end="00:49:20.710" style="s2">work I&#39;ve done you can&#39;t undo the work</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.230" end="00:49:24.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.710" end="00:49:26.920" style="s2">and so this different quality of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.600" end="00:49:30.070" style="s2">figuring out something that wasn&#39;t ours</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.920" end="00:49:38.200" style="s2">before before what do people think</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.070" end="00:49:38.980" style="s2">what is this different this command for</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.200" end="00:49:45.540" style="s2">your crew</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.980" end="00:49:45.540" style="s2">oh that&#39;s easier to just do right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.290" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">you should feel free to iMeet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:06.820" style="s2">there&#39;s the kids background noise I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:12.610" style="s2">like I think I know it&#39;s not in my nose</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.820" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s because I think I need to go fix</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.610" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">so after all so yeah and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:28.030" style="s2">even a that this already it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">started there are some basic thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.030" end="00:50:39.790" style="s2">and ideas how to make it happen and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:44.950" style="s2">and just you know talk about it and have</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.790" end="00:50:47.590" style="s2">a point of view that is the outside of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.950" end="00:50:50.820" style="s2">this and still so it&#39;s still close</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.590" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">enough so you understand what is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.820" end="00:50:59.730" style="s2">what is the meaning of the project right</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:59.730" style="s2">so it&#39;s very it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.980" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">I think compared to projects that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.890" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">already put more time and energy into</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.010" end="00:51:25.100" style="s2">because I feel like I have less</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.109" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">ownership on this type of experiment the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.100" end="00:51:30.859" style="s2">thought experiment we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to just dream big and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.859" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">talk about scope a lot in in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:40.550" style="s2">programming and so well this is all</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:42.590" style="s2">hypothetical we can just keep slapping</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.550" end="00:51:47.150" style="s2">on features and slapping on features</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.590" end="00:51:50.420" style="s2">because we&#39;re just dreaming I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.150" end="00:51:52.550" style="s2">some of the work I&#39;ve done on other I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.420" end="00:51:55.850" style="s2">guess the project that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.550" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">spending my time on I&#39;m aware you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.850" end="00:52:00.950" style="s2">just keep adding features all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:05.330" style="s2">things cost something in terms of money</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.950" end="00:52:11.210" style="s2">or maintenance or time or complexity um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.330" end="00:52:14.510" style="s2">so that is different when we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.210" end="00:52:16.970" style="s2">doing whatever you said Jubilee we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.510" end="00:52:21.260" style="s2">doing this hypothetical we just the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.970" end="00:52:22.550" style="s2">mythical I think you said um experiment</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.260" end="00:52:24.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s like yeah let&#39;s add a calendar</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.550" end="00:52:29.090" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s add pingbacks yeah let&#39;s add</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.980" end="00:52:34.250" style="s2">um security and this like sure let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.090" end="00:52:37.850" style="s2">it all and but if you go down to earth</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.250" end="00:52:41.510" style="s2">for a moment you I guess that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.850" end="00:52:43.880" style="s2">reason why it&#39;s easier to to to do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.510" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">Dreaming part on this as compared to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.880" end="00:52:51.380" style="s2">project that kind of got a I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">cost limit a scope limit this is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.380" end="00:52:56.330" style="s2">many features I could reasonably have</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.800" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">yeah I could add more features in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.330" end="00:53:00.260" style="s2">future but they&#39;re they&#39;re not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">and I&#39;ve kind of done the work to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.260" end="00:53:07.460" style="s2">what&#39;s most necessary and we&#39;ve we</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:11.990" style="s2">haven&#39;t it seems like on the tool</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.460" end="00:53:14.270" style="s2">library project it almost feels like</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.990" end="00:53:17.320" style="s2">everything is necessary I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.270" end="00:53:17.320" style="s2">you leave something out</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:25.080" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s one of my views on</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.830" end="00:53:27.650" style="s2">this I think that&#39;s that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.080" end="00:53:30.510" style="s2">insightful that it what we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.650" end="00:53:33.660" style="s2">feature up on feature and so the next</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.510" end="00:53:35.490" style="s2">question would be we only have less than</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.660" end="00:53:38.310" style="s2">ten minutes left but if we were to like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.490" end="00:53:40.440" style="s2">focus on creating a beta write something</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.310" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">that was super easy well we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.440" end="00:53:43.050" style="s2">really be able to agree on does this</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:45.270" style="s2">meet all my needs because it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.050" end="00:53:47.720" style="s2">meet all of any of our needs but could</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.270" end="00:53:49.740" style="s2">we agree that this is the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.720" end="00:53:52.140" style="s2">therefore we&#39;re gonna build on it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.740" end="00:53:54.270" style="s2">like like would you be willing to put in</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.140" end="00:53:56.490" style="s2">a few tools if you can&#39;t control who</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.270" end="00:53:57.990" style="s2">sees it right like like maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.490" end="00:54:00.119" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna put in your entire</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.990" end="00:54:01.980" style="s2">inventory until you can control it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.119" end="00:54:03.600" style="s2">like at what point do you walk away</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.980" end="00:54:06.630" style="s2">completely because you don&#39;t get your</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.600" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">thing or you don&#39;t I mean like what kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.630" end="00:54:10.920" style="s2">of consensus to come to to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:12.750" style="s2">thing is the one that has the minimal</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.920" end="00:54:15.750" style="s2">features and hopefully we can build on</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.750" end="00:54:17.970" style="s2">it right like I would use it even if it</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.750" end="00:54:19.830" style="s2">did then didn&#39;t have a calendar I&#39;d keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.970" end="00:54:22.260" style="s2">track of that on the side and I just</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.830" end="00:54:26.510" style="s2">keep praying that we had a calendar one</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.260" end="00:54:26.510" style="s2">day but I&#39;m not gonna just not use it</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.109" end="00:54:32.190" style="s2">and even this conversation we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.359" end="00:54:34.410" style="s2">doing it right we&#39;re like thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.190" end="00:54:35.940" style="s2">thinking about so it&#39;s like right if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.410" end="00:54:37.260" style="s2">were to actually create the beta we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.940" end="00:54:39.270" style="s2">gonna come up with different tension</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.260" end="00:54:41.100" style="s2">than the idea of maybe creating the beta</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.270" end="00:54:42.390" style="s2">right because when it actually comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.100" end="00:54:43.650" style="s2">down to using it you put it on your</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.390" end="00:54:45.240" style="s2">inventory and be like oh wait if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.650" end="00:54:46.710" style="s2">no calendar actually this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.240" end="00:54:48.840" style="s2">useless I&#39;m gonna use all the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.710" end="00:54:50.490" style="s2">already exist but owning that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.840" end="00:54:52.859" style="s2">the feedback of like I said I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.490" end="00:54:56.490" style="s2">put my tools in no not this is too much</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.859" end="00:54:57.540" style="s2">work like part of I don&#39;t know I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.490" end="00:54:59.100" style="s2">put myself in the hot seat who&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.540" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">processor like it&#39;s like that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.100" end="00:55:04.440" style="s2">working through is that frozen it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:09.000" style="s2">I want to say remember this feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.440" end="00:55:12.690" style="s2">whatever this feeling is of wanting an</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.000" end="00:55:15.930" style="s2">idea to happen not having to own it that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.690" end="00:55:17.850" style="s2">kind of moment we just did like stay</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.930" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2">there and like what does that feel like</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.850" end="00:55:25.619" style="s2">is it better</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:29.060" style="s2">is it and and how do we keep creating</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.619" end="00:55:29.060" style="s2">those moments of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.810" end="00:55:48.330" style="s2">that type of cohesion felt a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.840" end="00:55:49.980" style="s2">like a project raising but the project</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.330" end="00:55:51.600" style="s2">person wasn&#39;t here so we just like had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.980" end="00:55:53.460" style="s2">title and we&#39;re like let&#39;s just add</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.600" end="00:55:54.750" style="s2">level on it and let&#39;s just you know ping</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.460" end="00:55:55.980" style="s2">off of each other and say well I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.750" end="00:55:57.240" style="s2">it does this okay what do you think it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.980" end="00:56:00.540" style="s2">does that but maybe you could do this as</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.240" end="00:56:01.950" style="s2">well but I had that same vibe of like us</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.540" end="00:56:04.050" style="s2">not owning it but I say trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.950" end="00:56:07.650" style="s2">contribute to it and give ideas and sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.050" end="00:56:09.480" style="s2">of move it forward in not a real way but</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.650" end="00:56:13.320" style="s2">like just with ideas that maybe somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.480" end="00:56:17.160" style="s2">else could help move over it feels</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.320" end="00:56:20.220" style="s2">really clean as the word that I would</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.160" end="00:56:24.050" style="s2">use like not being attached to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.220" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">project as something that I own and I am</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.050" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">i have my expectations and i have all</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:36.030" style="s2">the feelings connected to it because</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:42.330" style="s2">it&#39;s mine I think this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.030" end="00:56:46.080" style="s2">selflessness involved in talking and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.330" end="00:56:49.860" style="s2">creating project that I do not feel the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.080" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">need to all completely and I can I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.860" end="00:56:58.320" style="s2">able to work on it just for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:57:02.670" style="s2">doing something great there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.320" end="00:57:15.590" style="s2">allegory in like the art of shooting</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.670" end="00:57:18.360" style="s2">arrows that it&#39;s like not caring not</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.590" end="00:57:23.340" style="s2">bringing yourself yourself to the table</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.360" end="00:57:28.650" style="s2">with all the all your ego I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.340" end="00:57:30.990" style="s2">the key and then you can engage with all</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.650" end="00:57:35.610" style="s2">your energy in the project without</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.990" end="00:57:42.900" style="s2">caring that it&#39;s not yours it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.610" end="00:57:44.549" style="s2">great feeling my closing statement is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.900" end="00:57:46.259" style="s2">how to tap into that with</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.549" end="00:57:48.269" style="s2">forcing it right without saying that</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.259" end="00:57:49.589" style="s2">this has like you&#39;re not allowed to own</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.269" end="00:57:51.150" style="s2">it you&#39;re not allowed to bring your much</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.589" end="00:57:52.589" style="s2">near you don&#39;t a lot like us you&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.150" end="00:57:54.029" style="s2">of it is just continually owning that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.589" end="00:57:55.410" style="s2">right that like someone&#39;s playing with</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.029" end="00:57:56.699" style="s2">my toy and I want to kind of hold it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.410" end="00:57:59.429" style="s2">back even just acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.699" end="00:58:00.809" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s enough to release it but</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.429" end="00:58:02.099" style="s2">then other times it&#39;s like no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.809" end="00:58:03.509" style="s2">something here that someone&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.099" end="00:58:09.509" style="s2">like use my pressure washer and they</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.509" end="00:58:10.469" style="s2">don&#39;t have the skill set and the more we</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.509" end="00:58:12.509" style="s2">can just have these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.469" end="00:58:14.009" style="s2">conversations and play in this space and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.509" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">then feel like what&#39;s different and</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.009" end="00:58:19.140" style="s2">unique about it the model able to create</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:24.150" style="s2">something that is different without</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.140" end="00:58:25.979" style="s2">forcing it yeah and I&#39;m supposed to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.150" end="00:58:31.019" style="s2">to another meeting now that we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.979" end="00:58:33.089" style="s2">hour but yeah I learned a lot today just</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.019" end="00:58:37.979" style="s2">from this process and hopefully in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.089" end="00:58:41.069" style="s2">future here or other places that go and</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.979" end="00:58:49.289" style="s2">on the stuff I&#39;ve been working on I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.069" end="00:58:52.650" style="s2">try I can bring this to that yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.289" end="00:58:54.929" style="s2">learned a lot today thank you it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.650" end="00:58:56.549" style="s2">like how are our individual projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.929" end="00:58:57.420" style="s2">that we have ownership on and people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.549" end="00:59:00.150" style="s2">coming in and offering</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.420" end="00:59:01.829" style="s2">how can we how do we invite ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.150" end="00:59:03.660" style="s2">give it up but how do we also invite a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.829" end="00:59:06.539" style="s2">group of people how can I invite more</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.660" end="00:59:08.189" style="s2">people into giving feedback when I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.539" end="00:59:11.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve already got it figured out like</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.189" end="00:59:18.509" style="s2">that&#39;s been unhelpful but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:20.039" style="s2">known how to get out of that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.509" end="00:59:23.959" style="s2">gonna have any closing statements before</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.039" end="00:59:23.959" style="s2">we say goodbye to YouTube and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.739" end="00:59:28.949" style="s2">strips me how similar this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:30.569" style="s2">was to sort of take you gather tech as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.949" end="00:59:32.759" style="s2">project where because no one owns it</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.569" end="00:59:34.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more free to sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.759" end="00:59:35.999" style="s2">shoot stuff out there and nobody has the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.140" end="00:59:38.069" style="s2">same sort of ownership as the individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.999" end="00:59:40.829" style="s2">projects which almost seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.069" end="00:59:42.599" style="s2">useful separation in in projects like</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.829" end="00:59:44.549" style="s2">there&#39;s the individual projects or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.599" end="00:59:49.289" style="s2">owned projects and there&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.549" end="00:59:50.999" style="s2">co-op projects and end up lifting</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.289" end="00:59:52.979" style="s2">Boltzmann&#39;s we&#39;re talking both but</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.999" end="00:59:57.239" style="s2">having two different frameworks to show</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.979" end="00:59:58.290" style="s2">here&#39;s what it&#39;s like when one person</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.239" end="01:00:00.119" style="s2">owns it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.290" end="01:00:01.380" style="s2">as sort of that framework on how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.119" end="01:00:03.270" style="s2">treat them in their idea and their</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.380" end="01:00:04.470" style="s2">ownership and then what happens and how</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.270" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">do you retreat a project that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.470" end="01:00:09.660" style="s2">something like together tech or this</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:11.640" style="s2">thing that we just you know spent 30 or</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.660" end="01:00:13.710" style="s2">45 minutes talking about that none of us</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.640" end="01:00:15.270" style="s2">really owns or has any you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.710" end="01:00:17.579" style="s2">particular plans to move forward with</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.270" end="01:00:19.050" style="s2">personally but if there was a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.579" end="01:00:21.900" style="s2">participate we probably what it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.050" end="01:00:24.540" style="s2">like I kind of this conversation for</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.900" end="01:00:26.940" style="s2">sure no we&#39;re playing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.540" end="01:00:29.700" style="s2">pictures and everybody which ones are</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.940" end="01:00:31.470" style="s2">best for me somebody had started it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.700" end="01:00:33.329" style="s2">they had taken this feedback and yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.470" end="01:00:34.890" style="s2">built in about 80% of that I think most</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.329" end="01:00:36.690" style="s2">of us would be like Oh check that out</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.890" end="01:00:38.280" style="s2">that sounds cool because that was also</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.690" end="01:00:41.579" style="s2">what I actually would I don&#39;t know if</p>

<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">saying hey we don&#39;t own it we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.570" end="01:00:52.410" style="s2">making it but hey what do we imagine we</p>
