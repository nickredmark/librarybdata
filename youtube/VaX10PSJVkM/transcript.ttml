<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">you encounter bats at a time</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">when you&#39;re feeling a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">foreboding and creepiness because</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">night is falling or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">realize that there are something like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">thousand species of bats</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">on earth that&#39;s a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">different kinds of creatures that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">almost a quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">mammal species and they are tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">diverse</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">some of them are even quite beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">quite easy to relate to you&#39;ve probably</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">the old world those are fruit bats and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">flower bats from the old world that look</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">like dogs</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">except hung upside down</p>

<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">little appendages on their noses those</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">appendages do not have any bone in them</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">those appendages when you hold one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">these animals in your hand the</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">if you watch bat mothers tend to their</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">offspring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">absolutely adorable right they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">they have tiny numbers of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">mothers will fly around with a bat</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">under their wing and then when the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">animal is large enough that the mother</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">can&#39;t fly with it at the point that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">baby is more than 25 the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">mother they&#39;ll leave it in the roost</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">and they&#39;ll come back and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">ferociously clean its wings of parasites</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">and things like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">and uh and feed the the offspring anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">they really are in mammals a mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">care for her baby</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">is universal it is universal even in</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">centurio cynics</p>

<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">um so this animal uh this is another</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">phyllostamatid right</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">uh phyllostomid yes it&#39;s a final stomach</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">bat</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">um fruit eater and this animal eats</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">fruits that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">carry so it kind of buries its face in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">fruit on the tree which is probably why</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">selection has</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">purged the face of fur</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">when this animal sleeps it pulls a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">flap of skin over its face and that flap</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">of skin has two</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">light spots in it so it can see shadows</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s not a handsome creature no um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">no it even hides from itself it even</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">hides from itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">um but anyway i guess my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">um i mean you started i shared a picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">of flying fox you started by saying the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">flying foxes are quite beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">um but no one living in the new world</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">ever sees those like they&#39;re not here</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">one of the misnomers is that there&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">world and new world bats</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">um and all the all the so-called old</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">these echolocators are actually the vast</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">majority of bats throughout the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">and there are only a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">of the megabats um that are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">beautiful actually but unless you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">the old world which includes australia</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">africa and some parts of south asia</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll never run into them yeah and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">so you know what you might run into is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">actually we did on one of our first</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">trips to madagascar is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">um a tree full of them just beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">wake up at night and you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">effectively startle yourself so much</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">that you embarrass yourself in front of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">the local people</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">as we did never happened never happened</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">um but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">the thing is you don&#39;t have good access</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">to bats in general so you don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">that all of the characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">make a creature endearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">you know look you probably think rodents</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">are kind of creepy and gross</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">right but then you realize squirrels are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">rodents and squirrels are actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">tremendously engaging highly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">um fun to watch and i find bats are kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">of like this too</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">there are some species that are creepy i</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">mean vampire bats now that&#39;s a creepy</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">animal and it smells creepy</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">but a fishing bat is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">animal that can basically detect the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">presence of fish</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">when fish come up to the surface to feed</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.199" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">they make a ripple</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">this bat can detect the ripple with an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">echolocation call</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">and it swoops in over the water and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">gaffs the fish</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">this is an amazing remarkable thing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not creepy</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating when you watch a fruit</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">bat cleaning its young it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">endearing and so anyway i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">this has to do with the fact that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">humans are sort of predisposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">creeped out by</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">things in the dark and b that our</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">encounter with bats is often</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">um at a distance and sort of the jarring</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">discovery that oh that&#39;s not a bird</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">but the close encounters with these</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">things reveal that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">really interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">mammals that if flipped right side up</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">and in the day</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">you would feel very differently about</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">them all right next question</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">are humans the only species that use</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">dopamine and does evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">have anything interesting to say about</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">dopamine and social media</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">i meant to actually look this up to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">sure but i believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">that dopamine dopamine is at least as</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">old as vertebrates and it may actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">extend far far older than that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">into the into the history of animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">so certainly certainly it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">humans or primates or mammals um it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">least all vertebrates and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">maybe far far alert than that right but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">what that means and what that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">um is a little bit tougher</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">puzzled so um you get into this with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">actually peterson and his</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">uh the reason that he is associated with</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">lobsters is that his point</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">is that serotonin i believe is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">associated with uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">dominance hierarchies and it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">to our branching point with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">crustaceans</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">um and so his at least that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">goes back right so his point is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">isn&#39;t a human thing get over it right</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">this is a really really ancient thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">and his point is right about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">now the problem though if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">is these molecules are</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">part of an agreement right a physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">the molecule be it a hormone</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">or a pheromone is a molecule built to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">trigger a receptor when it hits it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">because it has the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">shape and the right configuration of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">charges on its surface</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">it could be anything right so you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">dopamine and you could engineer a system</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">in which dopamine did serotonin&#39;s job</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">and serotonin did dopamine&#39;s job</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">and it would work just as well because</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">the point is well it&#39;s actually like</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">when you hit yourself in the eye and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">see light why did you see light there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">no light</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">right you see light because those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">light receptors and you&#39;ve triggered</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">them with pressure</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">but they detect it as light because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">send the message to the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">brain that detects light</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">and so the point is what it&#39;s wired to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">is what dictates what it does not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">shape of the molecule the molecule is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">totally arbitrary so so in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">for instance peterson&#39;s lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">um serotonin is both h is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">and hierarchies are ancient and the link</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">between those two</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">also turns out to be ancient but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">third thing isn&#39;t inherently true just</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">because the first two things are true</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t have to be true right</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">it is in this case right but right it</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">could be that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">um the molecule was associated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">hierarchies and lobsters and is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">associated in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">with hierarchies in us but that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">continuous process</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">or it can be that it was continuous but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter in case of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">dopamine it will serve a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">very similar function for many many</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">right so uh back probably through all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">mammal&#39;s dope i mean it&#39;s going to play</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">a reward</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">uh role does it play that reward role</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">you know in vertebrates deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">i i would guess it probably does yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;d be my guess too but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t really matter yes very</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">ancient not not about humans in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">slightest</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">yeah uh so the second part of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">question which we&#39;re probably spending</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">long on these early questions is does</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">evolutionary biology have anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">interesting to say about dopamine and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">um well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">obviously a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">that causes you to release dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">captures your attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">and tends to get you focused on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">um so for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">a would-be lover</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">who tantalizes you such that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">rewarded for being in their presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">right captures your attention and makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">it harder for somebody else to get your</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">so that can be a game now in that case</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a natural game and you may have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">interest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">playing along in the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">social media platforms they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">gamified</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">their war with each other in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">keep you on site</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">they have figured out how to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">rewards that shouldn&#39;t be triggered in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">you so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">it may be that you should go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">some exercise</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">and go encounter something real but</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">facebook</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">is tricking you into staying on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">by making you feel as if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">something that&#39;s good for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">and it causes self-harm and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">tristan harris would be the go-to guy on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">we should have him on the podcast oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">absolutely for sure but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">yes so it does have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">mostly what it says is that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">endogenous system is being gamed for</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s advantage</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right and final question from</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.200" style="s2">episode 42</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">what&#39;s the explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.200" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">totalitarianism i don&#39;t think the woke</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">left sees themselves a totalitarian but</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">does that mean does that mean it comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">naturally</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">all right i would say the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">for totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">is in some ways just almost too obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">you can do very good things for you if</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">you have total power over people</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">right and so the ways for people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">discover that it is the right thing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">them to do to install a system that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">so happens to put them in charge</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">of what you do um we should that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">evergreen discovery</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">and in both senses of the term i guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">but uh yes it is and the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">for the rest of us is to figure out hey</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">how can we stabilize a system</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">that does good for people in some way</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">that&#39;s fairly distributed and resists</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">falling into totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">and what we are facing now is the pull</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">of totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">is uh we are in a tractor beam and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">are being pulled towards something</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">stupid and it could be one of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">but it hardly matters because what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">have is better than that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">we should we should fix what we have so</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t fall into the black hole</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">yeah and i mean there&#39;s this this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">always a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">what has been and what could be which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">sometimes understood as</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">conservative versus liberal as the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">versus the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">as orthodoxy versus heterodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">but the fact is that we need both and uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">the totalitarians</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">always come pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know about always these</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">now are pretending to be about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">future and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">um come close in the language of of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">left of course this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">um it has actually nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">what does this look like the future or</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s will this look like it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">me or good for</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">everyone oh it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">good for me that&#39;s why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">actually what it ends up at and are some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">people actually confused do some people</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">see that who are engaged in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">movement probably but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s still what&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">to be the effect</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">okay this came the next question before</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">we get into questions from episode 43</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">yeah i mean i i think actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">simple to articulate what it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">difficult to implement but if you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">to the good old days which were not so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">good but the good old days</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">in which uh science discovered things</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">regularly of high value without</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">so much garbage they actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">existed in an era in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">people&#39;s incentives were aligned now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">not advocating for a science in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">only the rich can participate but when</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">the rich participate in science</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">they are in some sense immune from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">short-term</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">financial corruptions that dog others</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">right so if you had gentlemen scientists</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">they were free to say heterodox things</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">and if it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">you know didn&#39;t interrupt their ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">to earn because basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">wealth was the substitute for earning</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">so the point is if you want the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">to work well</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">which is a little bit like what tenure</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">is supposed to um</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">create yep tenure is supposed to and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">supposed to replicate the aristocracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">the protections that the aristocracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">right and let&#39;s just say the reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">tenure doesn&#39;t work in my opinion or at</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">least one of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">is that the rigors of what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">go through to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">tenure are mutually exclusive with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">instincts that will cause you to use</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">tenure to good effect right so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">ensure that you&#39;re not up to anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">heterodox stay in line stay in line</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">you have anything to say right no</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">actually it turns out not and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">think of this as the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">as our electoral politics right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">let&#39;s see how good you are at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">corruption game you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">and then you achieve office and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">you know act on behalf of the public um</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">well not bloody likely you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">um you know tested people&#39;s mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">with a pole vaulting competition or</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">but uh if you want this system to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">you have to align people&#39;s incentives</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">with being right</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">in the long term that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">things that should</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">somehow reward you so if you&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">legacy if you want to be remembered</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">being really really really right is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">way to do it right the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">not just being really really really</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">right but being really really really</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">early we want you really right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">really early that&#39;s the gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">now the problem that we have which i</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">decried many times is that we honor</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">that are a little bit early right stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s too early</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">oh we absolutely murder that stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">murder that stuff and then we never</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">rehabilitate it we don&#39;t go back and say</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">by the way you know who turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">right this person who was 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">ahead of darwin right</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">very occasionally those stories do get</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">do get resurrected and i can&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">with any of those examples right now but</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">in part the problem is that it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">know by virtue of it being that early</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s unrecognizable by almost everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">so some of those people</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">have you know simply a vested interest</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">in keeping the status quo of course and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">so would not see it even if they could</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">but most people simply cannot see that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">which comes so early that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">contacts yet exists</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">right but our system of peer review</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">is the biggest obstacle to this working</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">right because peer review</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">manages to keep all of the really</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">stuff out as a matter of quality control</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">which means at the point that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">turns out to have been way ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">their time there&#39;s likely to be very</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">little evidence of it and certainly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">not evidence that you have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">well it&#39;s not just peer review of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">the market incentives by universities</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">and to have faculty who bring in large</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.440" style="s2">grants</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">because the large grants get 28 to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">75-ish percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">taken off the top as overhead to run the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">universities</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">and so you want scientists if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">university who&#39;s bringing in large</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">grants from if you&#39;re in the united</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">states probably nsf nih</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">dod whatever it is and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">that means that big science that is big</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">expensive science is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">um is preferred is selected for and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">sort of you know the kind of math that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">you could do on a chalkboard or the kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">of research that you could do in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">field with a machete and duct tape and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">paracord and a plane ticket</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">not really encouraged by big</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">universities because they don&#39;t bring in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">the grants that allow the overhead to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">run the libraries and clean the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">sidewalks and such</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">what i&#39;m imagining many of the people we</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">have known</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">yes uh taking the method section that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">you just sketched out there and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">duct taping a plane ticket to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">a machete or i don&#39;t know what they</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">would be doing but um</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">all right so the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">though is we have to um the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">don&#39;t allow the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">into the system for the reason you just</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">described because of the grant overhead</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">peer review prevents the lodging it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:41.919" style="s2">very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">short the field uh to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.919" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">the school of thought that owns the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">field and say actually they&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">because it won&#39;t be registered anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;ll be treated as kook stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">you won&#39;t be able to resurrect it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">even the um the pre-print servers which</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">in theory should correct for this you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">have to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">a certain credential in order to even</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">use them so they bar</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">people who are outside who should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">able to lodge their shorting of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">uh just as uh as prominently well and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">this this is one of the few exciting</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">about early covet pandemic actually as</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">we talked about in our early episodes</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">right that the pre-print servers were</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">suddenly just</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">alive with so many papers right that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been vetted and does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">that there was a lot of dross</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">sure but that also mean that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">lot of stuff that we normally wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">have been able to see because it would</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">have been vetted</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">out of existence but it actually needed</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">to be seen yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">also the reduction in quality control</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">actually served science beautifully it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">was the demonstration</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">that those of us who aren&#39;t so fond of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">peer review</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">were right because it was a very vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">i would just point out one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">this is a hard uh game to beat</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">um there&#39;s a part of me that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">has a reaction people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">where i quite like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">when my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">attacked me for being stupid right</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">in so doing they are lodging the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">that they and i disagree over something</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">you know so for example there was this</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">case where i had put out a video</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">advocating for explorer modes as an</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">and i got attacked uh by jerry coyne and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">richard dawkins and stephen pinker</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">and neil schuben right and people</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;re like am i feeling less</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">like yes exactly do you know what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">just did</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">they just announced that they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">with this idea which i am</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">quite certain will turn out to be right</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">now it may take a long time</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">but at the very least it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">very hard to obscure</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">the fact that they didn&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">because they were all very vocal about</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">so um i would just say we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">allowing people</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">uh to lodge these objections to the um</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">to the dominant school of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">if you turn out to be non-trivially</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">right if you turn out to be right for</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">the right reasons</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">and very far ahead of your time then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">point is actually well what else do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what we should be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">yeah okay we gotta we gotta go a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">faster through these</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">um now finally we are going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">the first question from today</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">is the rise of social justice a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">religious revolution that our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">wait a minute the rise of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">a religious revolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">our cultural adaptation to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">religious war that is religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not no our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">adaptation to prevent religious war</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">can&#39;t recognize or</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">solve because the standard conception of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">a religion assumes metaphysical claims</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">is it the same for marxism generally so</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">when i try to read it again it&#39;s not or</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s some punctuation missing</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">probably because of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">character limits is the rise of social</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">justice of religious revolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">which our cultural adaptation to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">religious war</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">um as in which would advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">which would preclude religious pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">recognize or solve because the standard</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">conception of a religion assumes</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">metaphysical claims and is that the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">for marxism generally so</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">you know broadly social justice has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">widely discussed by us i think first by</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">john mcwhorter</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">um certainly by james lindsay as um</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">actually fitting</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">all of the rubrics for religion um but</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">the question the person asked in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">question is saying maybe most people</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">can&#39;t recognize it because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">have the metaphysical thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">and is might that also be the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">explanation for why people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">marxism as a religion so i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">to this yeah i think it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">mechanistic in the sense that i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">the elements that are described here are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">correct which is to say there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">strong religious aspect to these claims</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">right they are immune to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">because for the same reason that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">religious claims are immune to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s right man</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re challenging it says</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with you right</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">it is not exactly a religion right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">metaphysical claims explicit</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">metaphysical claims</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">puts it in an adjacent category at best</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">well we need but i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">i mean mcquarter has really written so</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">beautifully about this a number of times</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">but i and i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember what he does exactly</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">but as a linguist i&#39;m sure he gets</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">somewhere in this cat in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">in this territory that we basically okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">so religion is like one instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">some bigger category so rather than say</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">like okay this thing is adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s so but the venn diagram</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">needs the the larger categorical</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">of the thing that includes religion and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">social justice and perhaps marxism</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">and a number of other things all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">which have these i don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">would be 6 8</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">20 you know whatever um descriptors</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">well um i agree with that but i would</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">the larger category and i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">what mcwhorter uses as the larger</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">the larger category i would use is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">literally false metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">and remember literally false</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">metaphorically true is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">about um advancing an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">agenda no i don&#39;t think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">literally false metaphorically true is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">important and critical</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">and you we can approach those things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">say ah so i can see why kosher laws</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">and why it&#39;s not the story you tell but</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">why it&#39;s important and can be assessed</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">and agreed with or not from outside or</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">from inside whereas the the religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">part of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">which is its own ecosystem like a claim</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">that is literally false metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">true is just a claim but this</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">this is we&#39;re talking about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">ecosystem so i don&#39;t think literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">false metaphorically true is the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">well i&#39;m not sure i understand the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">objection you just leveled my point</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">these the people advancing these claims</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">are rapidly increasing in their power to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">shape civilization</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">to their own ends yes that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">the claims are nonsense right yes but</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">they are advancing in power and so i</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">would say that does</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">roughly meet the um the definition</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">now ultimately they will be unstable</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">but let&#39;s just put it this way literally</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">false metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">is a broad category that can be applied</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">let&#39;s say scientific beliefs belief in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">gravitational potential energy is such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">belief right</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">if you believe if you act as if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">believe it you can calculate all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">of things that you can&#39;t calculate</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">if you disbelieve it but there isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">evidence for it um</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">but so the distinction i&#39;m making and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually critical</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s akin to it&#39;s analogous to</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">is the population level which is it is</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">just it has emergent properties that</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">okay you&#39;re right under normal what</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">under normal circumstances the belief</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">would accompany a lineage which is the</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">that the ecosystem level analysis isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">the right one because the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">entity actually isn&#39;t it yeah so i meant</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">to say that i&#39;m going to back off the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">use of the word ecosystem and go back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">individual versus population right both</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">of which are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">both of which are evolutionary entities</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">except in this case the population</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t an evolutionary entity which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">why i&#39;ve argued it&#39;s unstable and will</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">come apart in the end in this case</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">social justice or</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">religion like social justice okay so</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">so you then are also taking issue with</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">like okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">exactly religion there is something less</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">stable because of the lack of lineage oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">is it but i&#39;m asking is that your is yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">because the internal dynamics in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">one lineage turns on the other will</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">ultimately tear the thing apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">inside guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">right so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">in any case the uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">the falseness of the claims are</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">paired with a strategy that is highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">successful at gaining</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">power this is temporary but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">rule it out</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">um and uh the difficulty in spotting it</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">the difficulty in spotting it probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">does have to do with the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">explicitly metaphysical yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">that&#39;s i think that&#39;s insightful</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">yeah yeah but i think the thing that in</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">the question that is hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">accept is that our you know built-in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">resistance</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that we have a built-in</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">resistance the the built-in resistance</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">to the extent it exists at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">has to do with the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">you know to the extent you dispense</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">with a claim that is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">you have an advantage and so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">this very short time window</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case these people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">the advantage um and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s going on okay next</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">depends on federal contracts and which</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">is forcing crt on its employees myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">included</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">what can we do to expand the trump</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">administration&#39;s anti-crt memo to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">include companies with contracts with</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">i think you&#39;ve just answered your own</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">which is the funding can be made</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">contingent i don&#39;t know what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">but uh to the extent so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">obviously um there are risks</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">to i mean in this case i would want that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">right yeah i think i think this ideology</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">is so dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">um but once you establish</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">a way for the federal government to uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">decide what can</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">and cannot be taught or said um across</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">things that are beyond the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">actual federal government</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">don&#39;t you we get at least into slippery</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">slope territory of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">uh potential overreach ah i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">the route for government abuse is there</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">yeah the point the point that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">is so central here is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">look abuse is always a possibility right</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">abuse of power</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">but the the entire informal nature of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">is taking the governmental protections</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">abuse and sidelining them so for example</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">establish a um an administrative</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">position at a college</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">whose purpose is to ensure diversity</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">equity and inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">which i&#39;m not going to do incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">thank you you&#39;re welcome but this</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">while we were at evergreen yes it did</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">well we were at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">affirmative action was illegal in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">state of washington</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">this was an affirmative action program</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">so that should have been prevented by</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">the laws that were already on the books</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">it at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">circumvented those laws because it would</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">have been inconceivable to hire somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">who was not</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">intersectional into that position</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">likewise i would say these departments</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">right they are circumventing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">protections against discrimination and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">the um so will there is there the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">for governmental abuse yes we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">some of this uh the supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">decision on</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">trans rights uh and the protection</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">um the supreme court just issued a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">bringing uh trans people</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">the potential for abuse exists but the</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">when people with power start forcing</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">there&#39;s no mechanism to challenge it at</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">least at the governmental level there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">a process by which we can say</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">is it fair to bar this right we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree on any of the particulars</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">here i&#39;m just concerned</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">about desiring more federal input</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">into decisions in private corporations</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">uh i would say</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">the other way i would say that the only</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">prevention</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">of some</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">is protections against that at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.679" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">governmental level where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">process to establish this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">fact and that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">right yeah i mean there will there will</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">be for</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">any one of these there will be someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.279" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">on this on one side that says we</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">absolutely need this or else democracy</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">will fail and someone on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">who says we actually can&#39;t have this or</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">else democracy will fail and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">um you know we we feel certain from</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:45.760" style="s2">as many domains as we could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">have that this particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.760" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">critical race theory woke ideology etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">um is is actually an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">at the societal level yep but</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that once you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">some power that has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">instantiated for this particular example</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">um that it can&#39;t be used badly elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">i agree and this is the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">libertarians are constantly saying who</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">will watch the watchers but my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">um we&#39;re stuck with that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">than the alternative which is no process</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">um and so there we are okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">um would you agree that kendi and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">d&#39;angelo took a kernel of truth and grew</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">a very misshapen crop</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">perhaps people have racist impulses</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">which they resist say the reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">brain seeks a tribalism which higher</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">function must rebuke</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">um you&#39;re not suggesting appointing</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">candy</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">and deangelo the kernel of truth for one</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">thing they would be kernels of truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">i believe i know you&#39;re going to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">it&#39;s spelled differently</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">i would but i won&#39;t bother because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">already did it for me um</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a colonel yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">i i want to say no actually like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">there are some</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">d&#39;angelo i think correctly diagnoses her</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">own personal problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">and then yeah extrapolates to every</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">other person</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">who shares her skin color and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:17.280" style="s2">extrapolation</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">is wrong right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.280" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">that kernel of truth in that case is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">robin deangelo turns out to be a racist</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">like she just has racist thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">and uh she is embarrassed by them and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">she&#39;s decided to make bank on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">embarrassment</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">candy seems to be and i have not</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">finished</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">the one book that i am willing to read</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">of his and i don&#39;t think i need to put</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">myself through any more of that but</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;m still not done with it um but</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">candy i&#39;m not even sure like he has true</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">observations</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">about um past</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">and even current examples of racism</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">but um the the leap that he then makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">to anti-racism is</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">equality of outcome and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">is racist doesn&#39;t even connect</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s not even like i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">the examples of racism that are true</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">that are the kernels of truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">would grow into the crop that he makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s just it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">there&#39;s not even connection but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so okay i mean what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">disagreeing over then is the question</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">about the kernel of truth and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">continuity between that and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">that they ultimately arrive</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my objection to to seeing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">to to this framing for candy at any rate</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">and then for d&#39;angelo it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">yeah for her i see how she got there for</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">her but then she extrapolates and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">no you can&#39;t you can&#39;t claim that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">are everyone because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">right but the kernel of truth is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">there are you know these are both</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">numbskulls who have</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.359" style="s2">kendi&#39;s no numbskull i think deangelo</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">actually probably just isn&#39;t very bright</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.359" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">but kendy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">clearly quite smart i&#39;m not saying he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">not smart yeah i still think he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">numbskull for</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">pulling this on us because i&#39;d go with</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">it [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">all right fair enough um but the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">uh people like deangelo exist</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">yeah so her extrapolation to it&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">us is clearly absurd</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">but the kernel of truth is yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">some low-level</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">thing that exists in some fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">the population right</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">um and in candy&#39;s case you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">there there is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">activity against racism an active</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">activity against racism that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">warranted and i will use an example from</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">my own life</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">when we were teaching i used to be very</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">about the fact that if i was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">uh an example of a person engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">and i just googled for somebody to put</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">together a lecture if i</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">googled you know love right or couple</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">i would just get a sea of white people</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">sure right and so i would</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">actively search for something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t come out of that sea of white</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">people just so that my examples</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">not always but sometimes well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">that you never used white examples no</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">i attempted to equalize the thing so</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">students did not have the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">oh this lecture about humor and white</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like in the case of love</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">or humor which are human universals</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">your examples should actually be</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">reflective of the background</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">demographics of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">right which turns out to be in that case</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">but that i mean this like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">in the case of for instance software</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">engineers you don&#39;t have to make all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">your examples</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">you know one to one male to female</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">because actually right no that</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">background demographic is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">be a match</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s not because patriarchy and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">turns out to be a diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">problem if you try to obligate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">a set of lectures that has no racial</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">bias in it like you&#39;ll spend the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">your life trying to build it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">done because for one thing even if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">try to correct it through google google</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">to the extent you use search terms you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">know you know it becomes your full-time</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">job which is exactly what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">it becoming for many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">right and you know i should tell you i</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">talked to my students about this at some</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">point and they pointed out that there</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">um that if you googled things from</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">different places you&#39;ve got different</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">racial biases</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">in the results you mean from different</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">like isps or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">from different nations they&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">vpn oh so anyway you could</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">see the wheels turning inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">thing but</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">anyway the point is yeah if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">want to give a lecture on</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">the nature of humor i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s much better to find</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">a you know kung people laughing than it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">is to find</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">you know in order in part to point out</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">the universality exactly because if</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to a bunch of american</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">undergraduates they know that people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">manhattan can laugh</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">right and they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">understand that it is universal and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">frankly is the cure</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">in part for racism right so i think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">important end growth of this is you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">want somebody in our position</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">to make a good faith effort to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">something that&#39;s maximally educational</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">and that means does not feed people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">inherent biases</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">about these concepts but do you want the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">for people to wag their finger at you if</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">you do put a white person on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">they say</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">why&#39;d you do that right you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">want everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">make a good faith effort to be properly</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">inclusive and you do not want some power</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">stricture</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">structure empowered to um to look over</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">your shoulder and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">you know seek errors yep okay next one</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">is just a comment</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">there is no way to not feed the crazed</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">left all stories have forced conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:29.599" style="s2">for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">if you can&#39;t talk then you fight they</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.599" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">won&#39;t allow us to talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">a fight is coming trump 2020 stays safe</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">um i agree with some of this yeah i do</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">do not feed the crazed left and it&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">says there is no way</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">to not feed the crazed left well i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">is other than fight</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">and i agree that at some level one must</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">fight but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not nuanced enough because there</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">are a great many people</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">who don&#39;t giving people an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">is important and so a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">who are espousing this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">superficially in order to keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">themselves safe are not actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">um consumed by it and uh reaching a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">handout to those who can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">uh reached is both strategically smart</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">and ethically right but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">yes the fight is coming clearly um</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">oh well we got to get through a few more</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">of these oh actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">sorry this is the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">question from the same person</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">um like a child no</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">these two are two parts of one question</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">i lost where i was from it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">thoughts on antifa black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">and black bloc</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">using the same weaponized control the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">narrative tools</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">learned from the mainstream media in</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;s now justified as a taste of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.359" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">own medicine argument in the defense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">their actions</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like a child reanimating abusive</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">parental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">please speak to altering the child&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">of your own medicine thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">um i mean in fact you&#39;ve chosen the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">example right to the extent yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">that somebody is abused and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">triggers abusive tendencies in them</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">that&#39;s understandable but who gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">abused it&#39;s not the people who abuse</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s not a taste of your own</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">medicine it&#39;s inflicting it on another</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">generation of people</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">and you know i think this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">mess we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">everywhere we turn that um trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">easily point to and usually you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">people don&#39;t have the sort of ordered</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">thought processes to carefully point but</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of thrashing about going</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">the thing that i&#39;m objecting to is still</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">how dare you expect me to stop and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">you know this is some of the rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">even from you know the the like antifa</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">black lives matter black bloc um and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">even even if some of their examples</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">and the narrative isn&#39;t what they say it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">is and you know all of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">are they reacting to something real have</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">they been handed a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">bad deal has a whole generation of</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">that people used to get handed yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">they have and that doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">necessarily incumbent on them to</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">everything that they have had to uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">contend with in part because their</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">and the drugs they were given and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">schools they went to and the screens</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">they were sat in front of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">broke them sufficiently that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">have an ability in some</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">yep i agree um for another time we</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">uh a broader view of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">where meritocracy coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">a brutal lack of a safety net results in</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">a certain number of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">who don&#39;t have any reason to defend a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">meritocratic system because they will be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">on the losing end of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">so yes they were these people were</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">miseducated and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">betrayed by a medical system that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">drugged them in all of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">but it should not be surprising that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">those who don&#39;t see themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">winning in a meritocratic system attack</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">ignoring facts that conflict with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">desire to truth is widespread</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">what&#39;s the solution you see it with ted</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">but also at boeing management with 737</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">max</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">do you know this example trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">remember it i don&#39;t know the example</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">at all i was aware of it but i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">resurrect it</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">um but you know what&#39;s the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">ignoring facts that conflict with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">desired truth</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">well the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">the alignment of incentives right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">fact is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">system that&#39;s right that causes you to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">pay the price for ignoring facts that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">had at your disposal is a good one and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">so you know just to take one example</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.640" style="s2">red teams that have an incentive to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">the weakness in the structure you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">incentivize you not to build a weak</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">structure so this is a term of art</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">in engineering or something yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly in computer security</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">okay but it can be in anything right you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">have a red team that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">going to try to exploit your security</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">for your building right</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">can you get in you make it a game where</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">they win if they get in and then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">find out if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got a flaw and red</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">you know we need intellectual red teams</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">too this is why i say</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">you should never allow one school of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">thought to take over a field</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">at the very least you need the next best</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">school of thought there to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">honest otherwise they&#39;re all going to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">crazy which they do</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the royal opposition the loyal</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">opposition right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:07.119" style="s2">um our declawed not by me cat</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">sharpened her claws on a cardboard edge</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.119" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:12.160" style="s2">instinct have it unlikely i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">it before</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.160" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">um yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.839" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">i mean the idea that you can declaw cats</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">is new and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">think i hope it&#39;s new and don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">like really horrifying and i appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">the person asking the question says it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">wasn&#39;t by</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">her um but um yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">uh it basically is moving it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">both honing the the nails the claws and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">and getting the muscles working</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">well uh i&#39;ve always imagined that it has</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">something to do with causing the claw</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">to curve that basically there&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">what would you it&#39;d be like um the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">process by which plants bend towards the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">that actually in this case attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">putting pressure um</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">but in any case why does a cat do it if</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have claws well presumably</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something wired in where the cat</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">experiments with this behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">discovers oh that feels really good</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">and it feels good because when they do</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">have claws it helps them you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s get the right curve maybe it may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe claws are a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.720" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">bit like teeth and they&#39;re actually sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">of connected by ligaments such that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">know getting the right pressure on them</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">makes them</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">stronger and aligned right whether or</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">not they&#39;re shaped right but</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">whatever it does for them it does</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">something that selection wants to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">um encourage more of and so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">good and so the feels good</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">uh that feels good circuit persists even</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">when the claws don&#39;t yep</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">i can see the cat in your lap he</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">disbelieves all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">yes it&#39;s wrong he just wants more cream</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">okay uh do short-lived species such as</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">mice</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">adapt better to changing circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">because of greater generational turnover</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:50.839" style="s2">if so is there any evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">advantage to being a very long-lived</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.839" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.050" style="s2">that&#39;s why there are no long-lived</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">species you heard it here first</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.050" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">um this is so this is a great question</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to see where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing yes your instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">um our mammalian immune system</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">provides a very interesting example that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">more or less</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">proves your point it&#39;s the exception</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">that proves the rule in the correct</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">the use of that phrase your immune</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">evolves on an hourly basis</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">if you are challenged by a pathogen you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">actually actually have</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">evolution taking place in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">specific immunity that is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">cells that respond to the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">which is how you ultimately defeat it so</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">your pathogen is a very short-lived</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">species that evolves very rapidly to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">parasitize you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">you are a very long-lived species which</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">makes you a sitting target</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">right in order to be a sitting target</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">and persist for a long life</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">you have a subsystem of you that evolves</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">on the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">scale as the pathogen so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">beat it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">right because basically you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">microbes that are you</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">that are evolving to counteract other</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">microbes and viruses and things</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">so yes you would be probably unable to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">live a long</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">life as an animal a plant can do this in</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">a different way</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">basically by uh you know a plant can</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">drop a limb and not die because it plant</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">is not composed of vital organs in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">same way</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">so an animal in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">not die of being a sitting target in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">world of pathogens</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">proving your point great okay we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">one more here</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">um and then go on to super chat from</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">this hour</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">i will say that there&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">advising you to reach out to the mods of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">the facebook group so for a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">so something is going on there dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">how is encouraging medical transition</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">for trans people</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">any different from encouraging breast</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">implants etc for women with body</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">dysmorphia</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">good faith reason the former is okay but</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">not the latter</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">question mark um</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">this is a tough one i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">i have a sense that the body dysmorphia</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">in uh straight</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.800" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">women presumably you mean non-trans</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">women the women who are getting breast</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">implants because of body dysmorphia</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">i believe are in large measure</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">responding</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">to a advertising and media apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">that is making them</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">insecure about something they needn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">insecure about because</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">that enriches those who are making them</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">insecure and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">we are creating a pathology</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">and they are remedying that pathology</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">with an</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">augmentation and at some level the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">answer to that is not the augmentation</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the um refiguring thing so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">making other people insecure is not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">profitable business model</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">yeah i mean this is it will the borders</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">of the categories will always be hard to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">exactly where they are always but</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">with regard to women getting plastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">surgery of any sort to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">better fit their you know the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">norms that they perceive</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">as the ones that they want to better fit</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">um is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">largely market driven and advertising</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">driven</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">and some of what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">with with trans and you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">many the orders of magnitude rise in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">number of for instance teenage girls who</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">are declaring themselves trans</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">would appear also to be some combination</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">um social contagion and encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">from larger society who are jumping on</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">the bandwagon</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">for reasons that we won&#39;t go into right</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">now but but</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">can and probably will elsewhere um so</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">those two kinds of um desire to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">to change your body i think are actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">very similar whereas</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">they&#39;re you know trans is real and there</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">cases where people really do have such</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">a mismatch in their heads between what</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">they feel themselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">and what they were born as uh and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">i you know i i see i i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">an honorable and um and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">fair thing to do as a society to allow</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">such people</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">um to to have a match between their</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">their brains and their bodies but um it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">minority of humans and is also i would</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">say a tiny minority of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">um describing themselves as trans yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">would say we also</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">don&#39;t have a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">information on</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">you know as you say trans is real</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">and until recently surgical</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">interventions and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">pharmaceutical interventions would have</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">been impossible right and many cultures</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">make allowances</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">for trans people that legitimize them</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">in their original form and i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">question is are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">people a greater service by</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">with surgery and pharmaceuticals or</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">would we be better off just figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">you know how to you know bring them</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">fully into the protections and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">understanding of society</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">right now that would be that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">the more honorable move i&#39;m sure of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">um okay next question</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">from this hour the dictionary has</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">changed the definition of female and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">male to include gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">how can we defend against this type of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">newspeak</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">so i i&#39;ll bet it has i&#39;d le i&#39;d love a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">reference i&#39;d love to know which</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">dictionary we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">although i believe at least some</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">dictionaries</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">have begun to i know a couple months ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">there was a move to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">change the definition of racism in</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">webster&#39;s i believe and webster said</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">why not can&#39;t see what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">downstream of this decision</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">um how can we defend against this type</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">of newspeak</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">and i think i think we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying in part it&#39;s not most</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">but in part by having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">between us that are unscripted and real</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">and the kinds of conversations that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">have at least sometimes we&#39;re not on</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">to give to you watching and listening</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">the some of the language</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">that allows that will allow you to push</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">back in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how what the pushback</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">against the dictionary changing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">will look like but those changes happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">because there is a widespread acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">and the widespread acceptance happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">because in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">people who disagree are quiet and people</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">who disagree</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">um being quiet is in part because</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;re scared but it&#39;s also in part</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">they&#39;re not really sure they know it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel right wait male and female</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">are our biological sex this is real</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">but they don&#39;t have the certainty of</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">their own footing</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">to defend themselves against the frankly</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">the crazy that comes at them</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:18.000" style="s2">so part of what we&#39;re trying to do i</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">think we haven&#39;t ever talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.000" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">but is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">is to share a language that other people</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">can use</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">um to discuss these things with people</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">when when it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">yep um i would say there is an argument</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">that the market</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">should solve the dictionary thing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">those who are fighting to poison</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">are trying to stigmatize</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">entities that attempt to give you higher</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">quality definitions</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">yep so we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">protect those entities</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">but i would just add one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">that i think we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">and i think this was something that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">did a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">as professors was demonstrating that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">what we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">saying is part of a world view that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">you just kind of let it</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">interact makes sense in other words you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">could come up with some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">that we claim are true</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">and they could just exist in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">but if you tried to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">based on those premises it would fall</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">on the other hand what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">about is part of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">toolkit of understanding that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">tested and the question is well all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">right how comfortable would you be</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">at their table if you were trans could</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">you sit at their table and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">this conversations you were trans and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">the fact is we&#39;ve had lots of trans</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">students and interacted with them</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">very easily and comfortably and so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">when extrapolated from this worldview</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">holds up</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">in light of true variation yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">an important thing to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">next question heather could you come</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">could you come please share some of your</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">exercises for teaching math to children</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">thanks a lot you&#39;re both heroes be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">blessed</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.839" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:03.680" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t um i&#39;d be happy to share</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">some of how i have taught math and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.680" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">um you know the the the work that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">mostly when i have taught math it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">to undergraduates which are usually not</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">i think of when people say children but</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">um of course there&#39;s an argument to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">made there</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">let me think i have to think on how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">answer this question and probably it</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">warrants just having something written</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">out and shared</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">but um one thing that is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">pointing out the math and daily life and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">pointing out its</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">its power and beauty everywhere and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">you know when when we&#39;re going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">with with the children</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">um talking about how far we&#39;re going and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:45.599" style="s2">whether or not how far</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">actually you know that the number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.599" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">miles on a bike</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">actually is a full measure of how hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:52.960" style="s2">it is and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">what you know number of miles doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.960" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">necessarily track to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">to how difficult so what other things</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">might you measure what other things</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">might you be</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:03.280" style="s2">be counting and keeping track of um and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">you know this is easy to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.280" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">kitchen where um if you take a recipe</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">using sort of an american standard of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">for instance weight or</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">rather volume and you want to um use</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">um you or and you want to double it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">know you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">say the kid okay this calls for two cups</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">of flour and there&#39;s five ounces of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">flour in a cup and we&#39;re going to double</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">the recipe how many ounces of flour do</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:28.160" style="s2">and you just start making it</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">backgrounded</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">like you just start</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">i am grateful to have never heard from</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">either of our children</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">what use will math be to me i cannot</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">imagine ever uttering those words myself</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">and i would have felt quite a failure if</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">either of them had ever said that not to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">say that they either of them enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">everything that i did to them or</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">every time i threw math at them but um</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">just making it part of the background</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">and part of the fun is is a big way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">um i would just add something else that</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">i know your dad did with you and you now</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">do with our kids which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">the purpose of math is not to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">answer so you can stop doing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">right so the fact that you can get to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:12.799" style="s2">the answer</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really mean anything if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.799" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know how it was that it worked</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">that you got there</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">and so um going through some other way</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">to get there in order that you can see</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">um what the process meant and why is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">key to understanding it and treating it</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">other than</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:28.799" style="s2">a take your medicine kind of endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.799" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">and this is i mean this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">you know a it&#39;s also about the journey</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">but also the journey is fun the journey</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:38.559" style="s2">isn&#39;t a slog</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">and i guess i would just say one other</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.559" end="00:59:43.280" style="s2">thing i am still</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">stunned by uh my own experience in</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.280" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">college with calculus</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:48.720" style="s2">right i had calculus from two different</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">teachers</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.720" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">and one of them who was not well liked i</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">thought was absolutely phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">at the board he just took a joy in</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">illustrating why things were functioned</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">the way they did and showing us how to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">do things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">it totally worked for me and the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">one who was pretty well liked</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">was very mechanical and it was just very</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:11.839" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">to care right because it was just simply</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.839" end="01:00:16.799" style="s2">a matter of here&#39;s how you do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">right right and recipe yeah right so</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.799" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all about incentives and to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">extent that the person up there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">motivated by the right stuff and can</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">convey the joy of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:28.480" style="s2">doing these things uh properly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">the hardest part</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.480" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">right the math itself isn&#39;t that hard</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">you know getting you oriented to it</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">correctly and knowing that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">go through it because</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">what you get at the other side is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">rewarding that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">important part yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:45.599" style="s2">right and i do i mean i do remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">um bringing math homework home when i</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.599" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">was a kid</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">and having my dad look at how i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">being told to do things in the you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">late 70s</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m just oh for god&#39;s sake no like</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to memorize a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">stuff you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">there&#39;s there will be no way that at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">end of doing this you will know</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">you will understand the the beauty and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">the truth of the math you will only know</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">how to do this current thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">fashionable which frankly math isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">about fashion sorry</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">no yeah he he was shaking his head</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">analog back before it had become an</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">online thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">yeah yeah he was okay i was gonna say</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">why is it deep space nine</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">it says holly math nerd deep space nine</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:35.280" style="s2">is the one in the space station where</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">nothing ever happens why would that be</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.280" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">so we have to admit that um we we</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">enjoy star trek but haven&#39;t watched much</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">of it uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t honestly remember i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t have an opinion in the space</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">station where nothing ever happens so</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">well but i just but do you have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">answer to the first part of the question</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">i mean obviously</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.440" style="s2">start correct the best series why is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">best star trek</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.440" end="01:01:59.440" style="s2">what is the best star trek series and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">why is it deep space nine</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.440" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">well i couldn&#39;t even name them all i</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">mean i couldn&#39;t even name</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">more than two honestly i think holly</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">is um clear this is a back door to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">that the fact that nothing happens in</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">deep space nine makes it more</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:18.839" style="s2">this is a wink to the buddhists there</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">you go yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.839" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">okay good one holly um yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.520" style="s2">i i can&#39;t imagine what you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">actually but</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:29.119" style="s2">okay and i just i don&#39;t know enough we</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">should do some yeah we should</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.119" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">probably watch some more star trek i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">not watching deep space nine</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">wow okay at my university student org</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">is pressuring faculty to have mandatory</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">anti-racism courses and training</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">they are surprisingly effective at</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">organizing and lobbying how can regular</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">people push back</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">so you don&#39;t say sam jam uh author of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">this question if you are a student or</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">faculty and the answer it&#39;s hard either</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.319" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">way for sure</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">but the answer is somewhat different</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">depending on which position you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.079" style="s2">i&#39;m just thinking that you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.480" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">literature has everything to teach us</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.079" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">about this and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">i unfortunately was not prepared for</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">this question but in catch-22</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">um there is a scene in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">um the pilots are being</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.319" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">instructed in some way and one of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">causes havoc</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">by asking some question like when is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">now why is right and where are the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">snowdens of yesteryear</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.160" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">so you might take that kind of approach</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">in seriousness you might take the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:46.079" style="s2">approach of</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:46.559" style="s2">asking good-natured but impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.079" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.559" end="01:03:50.240" style="s2">questions and then letting the thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">collapse of its own accord</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:54.799" style="s2">i think if i okay but you know what like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">you you are the master of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.799" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">really hard for the rest of us to either</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s one of two things like to come up</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">with the thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">that will that will effectively be the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">stick and the gears</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.880" style="s2">right yeah um in real time or if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:09.039" style="s2">come up with it like</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.880" end="01:04:10.720" style="s2">imagining saying it with a straight face</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.039" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">like just like getting it out of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.720" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">mouth like i i&#39;ve been in that position</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.559" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned enough from you in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">that i can sometimes come up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">exactly the thing i might say then like</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">i&#39;m going to burst out laughing like</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">there&#39;s no way i can do this in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:22.720" style="s2">street</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">so you really you have to hone you got</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.720" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">to scale it and you got it</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">but but it&#39;s worth honing especially if</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be subjected to this</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">nonsense so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">um yeah yeah see if you can&#39;t perfect it</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">and just you what you want to just</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:36.480" style="s2">lob the question that causes the thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">to reveal itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.480" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">right there&#39;s to the extent that you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">learn that you will find it is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">delightful exercise</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">yeah um and i haven&#39;t i haven&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">there yet but i</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">um i think the last chapter of helen</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">they are saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">you can you can do to push back against</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">this um and so i</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:01.200" style="s2">i said i haven&#39;t haven&#39;t gotten there in</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">the book yet but i imagine that it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">some very good advice and i got there</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:07.520" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">having just listened to megan dom&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.520" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">latest podcast which is a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">with helen</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:27.520" style="s2">i think the unspeakable podcast um</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:29.200" style="s2">is is quite good and um</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.520" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">she has one particular piece of advice</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.200" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">that i can&#39;t remember but maybe it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">come to me as we&#39;re answering other</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">okay to what extent is political</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">ideology hereditary</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">what evolutionary advantages are there</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">to different proto-political ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">what evil evolutionary advantages are</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">there to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:52.000" style="s2">different proto-political ideologies so</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:55.119" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem every time</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.000" end="01:05:56.160" style="s2">you raise the question of heredity or</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.119" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">hereditary</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">or heritability you run into the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">predicament</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:03.760" style="s2">which is that these words have a meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:04.559" style="s2">in common parlance that has a</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.760" end="01:06:06.480" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.559" end="01:06:07.599" style="s2">to their technical meaning but the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.480" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">relationship is</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.599" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">not straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">so to what extent is it heritable do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">mean genetically because heritable</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">is a genetic phenomenon um</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">technically it shouldn&#39;t be because</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">there are multiple pathways</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:28.079" style="s2">for heredity and to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">include something like cultural heredity</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.079" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">then it is highly heritable the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">household you grew up in has a lot to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">say about</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">what you end up thinking though probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:39.359" style="s2">not at all</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">transmitted on a genetic pathway and</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.359" end="01:06:43.520" style="s2">i would say if i can just cite eric here</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">for a second</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.520" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">long time ago eric and i were talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">the problem of these wrong beliefs that</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">are very</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">powerful politically powerful and he</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">truth is the second best strategy which</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.760" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">smartest things anybody&#39;s ever said to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:03.839" style="s2">me and the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">was instantly clear in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.839" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">our conversation what it means</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:11.280" style="s2">is some of us default to truth as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:12.960" style="s2">a mechanism for getting through the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.280" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">world right it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.960" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">but it means that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">seek to be right because that provides</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">you um with</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">some power but it&#39;s not the best route</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">to power</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">at all the best route to power is</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">affiliation</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">with some thing and that thing can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">saying totally wrong stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">but if it&#39;s powerful it will carry you</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">along with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:35.680" style="s2">and so what is the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">advantage to different proto-political</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.680" end="01:07:38.480" style="s2">ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">some of those political ideologies may</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.480" end="01:07:42.079" style="s2">be inventing something marvelous in</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">other words the american experiment</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.079" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">is really about creating opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:49.760" style="s2">that is broadly distributed</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:51.359" style="s2">and that does not pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.760" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">lineage you come from that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.359" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">and it was very powerful and maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">will be again</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">so signing up for that political</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">is a noble thing to do on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">signing up for woke ideology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">going to tear that all down in order to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">get some stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:10.640" style="s2">is a terrible idea but it&#39;s powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:12.799" style="s2">so the advantage</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.640" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">is power but the question is what is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.799" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">basis of the power is the power</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">derived honorably because the system</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">discovers good stuff and distributes it</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:25.199" style="s2">or is the power derived falsely by</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">stealing stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.199" end="01:08:32.000" style="s2">corralling well-being for example</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:33.679" style="s2">good have you heard of parker</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">crutchfield&#39;s morality pill to make</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.679" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">people complacent to lockdown measures</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:39.440" style="s2">suggested adding it to water supplies</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.440" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t um i&#39;m not sure i heard about</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">that was microdosing with psilocybin i</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">um either</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:53.359" style="s2">either way either this is that or this</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">is something else uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.359" end="01:08:57.600" style="s2">adding adding stuff to water supply</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:09:00.159" style="s2">seems a really really dangerous game</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:01.120" style="s2">another time we can talk about fluoride</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.159" end="01:09:03.759" style="s2">and why that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.120" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">itself was likely a very dangerous game</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.759" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">um but the idea of adding</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:08.960" style="s2">the idea of drugging the population</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:12.080" style="s2">against their will</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.960" end="01:09:14.480" style="s2">not so much no real really terrible idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.080" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">now if this is the same thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.480" end="01:09:18.640" style="s2">thinking of which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">a suggestion suggesting basically people</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.640" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">micro dosing on something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:25.040" style="s2">psilocybin uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">in order to deal with uh justified</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.040" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">anxiety from the state of the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:32.080" style="s2">uh there are potentially large</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">advantages to that but it has to be on</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.080" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">an opt-in basis</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">yeah has to be i would agree</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:40.319" style="s2">brett your idea of a place advertising</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:41.920" style="s2">its hospitality</p>

<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">what it&#39;s called now um</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">uh is has begun to cave to some of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:11.760" style="s2">woke ideology and it just seems so</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">obvious that there are so</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">many would-be college students out there</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:16.800" style="s2">and so many parents</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">would be college students out there who</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.800" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">are interested in paying tuition</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">to a school that isn&#39;t woke that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">be flocking to a school that was pushing</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">back against this</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">that maybe if you were the 200th</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:31.600" style="s2">to declare yourself and actually follow</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.600" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">on not being woke um that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">attract a flood of students but i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">even if you were the 200th</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">institution to do that you would</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:44.560" style="s2">certainly if you were in the first ten</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">like why doesn&#39;t any one of the number</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.560" end="01:10:46.719" style="s2">of now</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">struggling because of covid as if they</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.719" end="01:10:50.480" style="s2">weren&#39;t struggling enough already</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">liberal arts colleges or even r1</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.480" end="01:10:54.640" style="s2">universities</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">make a stand and be firm about it and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.640" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">think then</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:10:59.920" style="s2">watch the applications and then tuition</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">dollars pour in</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.920" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">yeah so the fact that this strategy</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:07.040" style="s2">seems like it would be such a slam dunk</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">that you know any college president who</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.040" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">figured out how to pull it off would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">heralded as a genius and a great hero of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">the institution and all that and yet</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:14.239" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:16.320" style="s2">tells you something about the horizontal</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.239" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">nature of this revolution</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:21.040" style="s2">the point is inside of each institution</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.880" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">there is enough firepower</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.040" end="01:11:24.800" style="s2">to drive out or destroy anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">tries it</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.800" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">so every institution goes over the edge</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">rather than it&#39;s spreading from the top</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:32.480" style="s2">of institutional institution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">spreading horizontally within them</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.480" end="01:11:37.120" style="s2">and yeah i guess i should just add that</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.679" end="01:11:38.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.120" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">oh i thought you were advocating for it</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.960" end="01:11:42.560" style="s2">no no no no quite the opposite okay no</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">i guess we&#39;re on the same page now you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.560" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">are an hour and 12 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:50.239" style="s2">okay uh let&#39;s do four more</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.480" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">ibram x kendi is giving a zoom</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.239" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">presentation at my university this week</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:57.199" style="s2">what should i ask him i want to be</p>

<p begin="01:11:57.199" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">so again it&#39;s different if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">student a faculty</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">or admin if you&#39;re a student</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">in this case i would say you actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:10.159" style="s2">have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">uh freedom a little bit more leverage uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.159" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">to be a little bit pushier with them if</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;re faculty or admin you might end up</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.159" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">behind the scenes getting metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:21.679" style="s2">beaten up for pushing back on</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">the sage of the day um</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.679" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">well i would i would ask him and mind</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:29.760" style="s2">you i have not read his book but</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">um i would ask him whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.760" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">there was an end point how you would</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:35.360" style="s2">know when you reached it and if there is</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">no end point how this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.360" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">simply even if we follow his</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">prescription going to result in an</p>

<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">unfair terrible unstable and dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.120" end="01:12:47.199" style="s2">situation on the far end of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:48.880" style="s2">yeah i guess actually i&#39;m remembering</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.199" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">now what helen plucker has said in this</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.880" end="01:12:54.880" style="s2">conversation with megan dom</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:56.560" style="s2">and it has to do with saying you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.880" end="01:12:58.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the politics of the person</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.560" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">asking but helen is speaking um as a as</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">a liberal</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">and she says you know um</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">the i don&#39;t know what we should call</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:08.719" style="s2">them but in this case</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">candy speaking for anti-racism a term</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.719" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">that he is defined</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">um don&#39;t speak for</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">all of us on the left in any way and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:18.719" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:19.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re a liberal you could do what</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.719" end="01:13:23.040" style="s2">helen suggests and say</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.920" end="01:13:27.040" style="s2">look um i am also</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.040" end="01:13:29.199" style="s2">you know grateful for all of the many uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.040" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">wins that liberalism experienced in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.199" end="01:13:32.880" style="s2">20th century</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:34.480" style="s2">um you know for in for civil rights and</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.800" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">uh and i have a very</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">different understanding of how best to</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:48.159" style="s2">continue to make progress</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">and that different understanding does</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.159" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">not make me the enemy</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:53.040" style="s2">and if you think that it does then and</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.040" end="01:13:56.080" style="s2">this i don&#39;t think helen says this but</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:57.679" style="s2">this is sort of where i would take it</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.080" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">if you think that my different</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.679" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">understanding of how we might get to</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">what you</p>

<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">then i would suggest that maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:09.760" style="s2">goals that you have are not the ones</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">that you say they are</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.760" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">nice nice that&#39;s really good uh the next</p>

<p begin="01:14:18.400" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll do three more after that because</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.920" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">that was an easy one</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:25.199" style="s2">um what&#39;s your opinion on the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.840" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">the struggles and adversity of</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.199" end="01:14:30.159" style="s2">adventuring out of africa in part makes</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.159" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">well the premise is not one that we are</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:37.120" style="s2">going to agree with</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:39.360" style="s2">um but even if you accepted the premise</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.120" end="01:14:40.719" style="s2">i would say it misunderstands what</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.360" end="01:14:43.120" style="s2">africa is</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.719" end="01:14:44.800" style="s2">africa is not a little plot of land uh</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.520" end="01:15:17.120" style="s2">like if if that were true</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.280" end="01:15:19.440" style="s2">you would predict that the people who</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.560" end="01:15:49.440" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:50.480" style="s2">um sure sounds like bs to me yeah i feel</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.440" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">like i&#39;ve heard of these people and i</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.480" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:54.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i can&#39;t pull up more</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">than i feel like i&#39;ve heard of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.400" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">um at the moment without looking it up</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:03.360" style="s2">but yeah it sounds like bs</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:05.840" style="s2">uh and um so i i think the thing the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">the key thing is this if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.840" end="01:16:10.080" style="s2">deficient in something it can cause</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">ill health if you&#39;ve got some pathway</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.080" end="01:16:13.679" style="s2">and up regulating it makes you</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">more healthy why isn&#39;t it being</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.679" end="01:16:16.880" style="s2">upregulated right</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">so there can be answers to this question</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.880" end="01:16:21.120" style="s2">but in general the idea that you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.960" style="s2">read some paper in which some pathway is</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.120" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">involved in some healthy thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.960" end="01:16:27.040" style="s2">and some corporation decides it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:29.199" style="s2">to trigger that pathway and then say aha</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.040" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve found the key to more health it</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.199" end="01:16:33.040" style="s2">just never pans out in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">the data even if they got good graphics</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.040" end="01:16:37.199" style="s2">though well a really good graphics skill</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.440" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">kind of a long way yeah yeah and a good</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.199" end="01:16:41.040" style="s2">brand name yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.480" end="01:16:43.360" style="s2">um so anyway i think you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">smell test here and there are loopholes</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.360" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">right there are things about us that are</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">rigged sub-optimally because of some</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">environment we came from my go-to</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.560" style="s2">example would be</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:54.880" style="s2">we are rigged very stupidly for</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.560" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">cold when we go into the cold our</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.880" end="01:16:58.159" style="s2">capillaries shut down</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:16:59.679" style="s2">in order to protect our core and</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.159" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">preserve heat because our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.679" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t have enough food</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:04.960" style="s2">whereas we could just we could up</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">ratchet the</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.960" end="01:17:08.480" style="s2">circulation to the extremities we could</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:09.760" style="s2">pump heat into them and then you could</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.480" end="01:17:12.480" style="s2">eat more at dinner and</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:14.239" style="s2">you&#39;d be great but um but we don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.480" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">and so we risk frostbite and we become</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.239" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">inept and all of these things in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">cold that are needless</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">yeah for the modern overfed human it</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">would be win-win</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t experience the cold</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">and you get to eat more without getting</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:26.159" style="s2">fat right and in fact if we could turn</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">down our discomfort at being in the cold</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.159" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:30.000" style="s2">go-to way to burn extra calories but the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:31.600" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.000" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">is you&#39;re wired not to do it because</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.600" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">your ancestors didn&#39;t have enough food</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.960" style="s2">and so the point is spending energy</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:39.120" style="s2">keeping yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.960" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">warm is something you&#39;re wired to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.120" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">at all costs it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:44.880" style="s2">physiological laziness but it i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is yep</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.880" end="01:17:49.360" style="s2">physiological laziness so anyway there</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.600" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">are places where there&#39;s a loophole that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.360" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">you know if we could figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:55.440" style="s2">turn down our sensitivity to cold</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.640" style="s2">and upregulate our circulation in light</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.440" end="01:17:59.440" style="s2">of cold rather than</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.640" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">bring it to the core that&#39;d be great um</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.440" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">in general these things are hard to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">right for the same reason it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">do things like turn down appetite by</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">interfering with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">uh the chemical pathways involved um</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">but anyway there are there are</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:13.280" style="s2">possibilities but in general these</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">things are nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.280" end="01:18:17.760" style="s2">yep okay the next two are also comments</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:18.320" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll get to one last question</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.760" end="01:18:20.320" style="s2">before we</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.320" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">stop for the day uh just enjoying the</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.840" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">okay one last question</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.880" end="01:19:03.840" style="s2">yeah one last question for today ooh</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">at a considerable donation thank you</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.840" end="01:19:07.600" style="s2">uh i turned to the outdoors during these</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">times but i&#39;m also drawn more and more</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.600" end="01:19:11.199" style="s2">to pornography and alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">what advice do you have to lessen my</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.199" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">consumption of these</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not an addiction but it may be</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:17.600" style="s2">becoming a habit i don&#39;t like it but</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:20.640" style="s2">oddly hard to stop</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.600" end="01:19:21.440" style="s2">these activities seem to creep up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.640" end="01:19:23.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.440" end="01:19:24.960" style="s2">terrific and terrifically worded</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.440" end="01:19:27.360" style="s2">question as well and i appreciate your</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">distinction between addiction and habit</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.360" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">um habits are things we should all um</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:33.440" style="s2">enable ourselves to form</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:35.360" style="s2">when they are good and to try to stop</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.440" end="01:19:38.640" style="s2">when they are bad but at what point</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.360" end="01:19:39.280" style="s2">do they become addictions you had</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.280" end="01:19:43.600" style="s2">well um i would say one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:46.159" style="s2">you know we talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.600" end="01:19:49.120" style="s2">addiction and our broken model of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.159" end="01:19:50.320" style="s2">on a past livestream one thing is better</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.120" end="01:19:52.400" style="s2">options are</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.320" end="01:19:53.760" style="s2">the key to avoiding addiction all right</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.400" end="01:19:56.000" style="s2">so to the extent that you have more</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.760" end="01:19:57.520" style="s2">entertaining things to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.000" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">you will tend not to default to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.520" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">stuff that you feel is destructive</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:03.760" style="s2">in the case of of porn it&#39;s probably i</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:07.120" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.760" end="01:20:10.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t say enough about uh what your</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.120" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">relationship status is to know but</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.239" end="01:20:13.760" style="s2">um to the extent that it scratches an</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:16.239" style="s2">itch that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.760" end="01:20:18.560" style="s2">um if you had to work harder by</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.239" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">interacting with people um</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.560" end="01:20:22.480" style="s2">to scratch the same itch you would end</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.880" end="01:20:23.920" style="s2">up more rewarded because you would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.480" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">interacting with them</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.920" end="01:20:28.080" style="s2">uh in a way that you know had a proper</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">challenge to it and all</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.080" end="01:20:32.400" style="s2">um during lockdown if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.880" end="01:20:35.760" style="s2">relationship um</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.400" end="01:20:40.159" style="s2">it it might be very hard to know</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.760" end="01:20:41.920" style="s2">how to proceed yep right i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.159" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">the thing i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.920" end="01:20:47.600" style="s2">anywhere yet but the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:52.080" style="s2">porn is that it gets in the way</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:55.600" style="s2">it is a consumer solution to</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.080" end="01:20:58.400" style="s2">uh a</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.600" end="01:21:00.400" style="s2">ability to generate fantasy internally</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.400" end="01:21:01.679" style="s2">and so at some level you&#39;re denying</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.400" end="01:21:03.679" style="s2">yourself something</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.679" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">and exposing yourself to the hazard of</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.679" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">what the market wants you to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.960" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">fantasizing about</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:14.800" style="s2">and you&#39;d be far better off to just say</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:17.199" style="s2">uh you know this is blocking some a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">cognitively productive activity i know</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.199" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird thing to say about it</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:22.719" style="s2">no but i mean you&#39;re making an argument</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:25.040" style="s2">that is sounds</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.719" end="01:21:26.080" style="s2">superficially similar to a familiar</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.040" end="01:21:26.880" style="s2">argument but it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.080" end="01:21:30.239" style="s2">different so</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.880" end="01:21:32.560" style="s2">the the the argument that many people</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.239" end="01:21:35.120" style="s2">will have heard a lot of places is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.560" end="01:21:36.639" style="s2">uh you end up seeing this sort of menu</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.120" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">of options that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.639" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">mostly not at least for women what women</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:41.679" style="s2">want to be engaging in but this is now</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.040" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:45.040" style="s2">men&#39;s heads for instance about what it</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">is that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.040" end="01:21:48.159" style="s2">they think is good sexual activity looks</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.159" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">um and you are saying not just does it</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:55.199" style="s2">put</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:58.639" style="s2">these um wrong things on a menu um</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.199" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">but it actually having a menu at all</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.639" end="01:22:02.239" style="s2">having being handed a menu makes it less</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:06.000" style="s2">easy and</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.239" end="01:22:08.320" style="s2">less easy for you to create your own</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.000" end="01:22:10.639" style="s2">sexual life and explore whatever your</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.320" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">own sexual fantasies might be</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.639" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">such that you actually may live an</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:16.639" style="s2">impoverished</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.000" end="01:22:18.480" style="s2">you know sexually impoverished fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.639" end="01:22:20.000" style="s2">and actual sexual life forever after</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.480" end="01:22:21.440" style="s2">because you thought from the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.000" end="01:22:22.960" style="s2">that it was about a menu that it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.440" end="01:22:23.440" style="s2">about someone handing you something that</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.960" end="01:22:25.280" style="s2">this was</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.440" end="01:22:27.280" style="s2">that sexuality was about market forces</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.280" end="01:22:28.719" style="s2">that you know narrative was about market</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.280" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">forces in the case of you know a</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.719" end="01:22:33.840" style="s2">slightly slightly related concept and</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">um yeah i mean i think that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.840" end="01:22:36.639" style="s2">that&#39;s apt</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.800" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">i think it&#39;s good i want to add two</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.639" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">things to it one you had an</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">excellent piece come out in aerial</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.840" end="01:22:44.000" style="s2">magazine this week</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">on pornography and well it&#39;s also about</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:46.320" style="s2">lizards</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:47.840" style="s2">and about lizards i mean of course the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.320" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">two things like hand and glove</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.840" end="01:22:52.560" style="s2">yeah um but sex love and sexual autism</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:56.159" style="s2">in area</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.560" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">yep the other thing that i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.159" end="01:22:59.840" style="s2">if we&#39;re comparing your internally</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.800" end="01:23:03.280" style="s2">generated</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.840" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">sexual fantasy with porn right</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.280" end="01:23:06.639" style="s2">here&#39;s something we can say for sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">porn</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.639" end="01:23:10.719" style="s2">is a market phenomenon as a market</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:14.880" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.719" end="01:23:17.840" style="s2">different producers are driven to</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.880" end="01:23:20.080" style="s2">compete with each other in a market</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.840" end="01:23:22.960" style="s2">saturated with stuff</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.080" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">are they delivering the ideal thing they</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.960" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">can&#39;t because if they deliver the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:28.080" style="s2">thing what separates them from everybody</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:31.440" style="s2">else so what they&#39;re delivering</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">is an increasingly extreme view of sex</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.440" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">and sexuality in order to get attention</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:36.320" style="s2">you have to push</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:37.600" style="s2">the envelope in order to stand out and</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.320" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">so what we know</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">is that porn has pushed the envelope way</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:42.639" style="s2">the hell out into crazy directions that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:45.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.639" end="01:23:45.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think to desire if they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.360" end="01:23:47.920" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.920" end="01:23:49.840" style="s2">pushed at you as normal and so the</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.920" end="01:23:53.040" style="s2">question is do you want to open</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.840" end="01:23:55.040" style="s2">your sexual life to this</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.040" end="01:23:56.400" style="s2">market force that pushes in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.040" end="01:23:57.760" style="s2">direction of extreme</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.400" end="01:24:00.080" style="s2">or would you rather figure out what you</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.760" end="01:24:03.199" style="s2">actually want right</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.080" end="01:24:06.400" style="s2">these are two um very different views</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.199" end="01:24:09.679" style="s2">and basically</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.400" end="01:24:11.840" style="s2">i think porn&#39;s hurting you so</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.679" end="01:24:13.199" style="s2">stop it right the internally</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.840" end="01:24:16.400" style="s2">endogenously</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.199" end="01:24:19.920" style="s2">generated stuff is natural</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.400" end="01:24:22.080" style="s2">and therefore your tendency</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.920" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">towards this that or the other is much</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.080" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">more likely to be healthy for you</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">so i agree with you but alcohol is also</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">hurting you</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:32.639" style="s2">and we both drink alcohol we both are</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:34.719" style="s2">probably drinking more alcohol than is</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.639" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">optimal for us probably any alcohol well</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.719" end="01:24:38.480" style="s2">in our defense</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:39.840" style="s2">it is 20 20. well but this i mean this</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.480" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">this is the question right</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.840" end="01:24:44.239" style="s2">and um you know just to read it again i</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:44.639" style="s2">think this is where we&#39;re going to stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.239" end="01:24:47.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.639" end="01:24:48.719" style="s2">um but you know i turned to the outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.120" end="01:24:50.560" style="s2">i imagine this is a man</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.719" end="01:24:51.840" style="s2">he says during these times but i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.560" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">drawn more and more to pornography and</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.840" end="01:24:54.800" style="s2">alcohol what advice do you have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:56.239" style="s2">lessen my consumption of these we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.800" end="01:24:57.600" style="s2">already spent time talking about porn</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.239" end="01:24:58.719" style="s2">but with regard to alcohol he says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.600" end="01:25:00.400" style="s2">not an addiction</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.719" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">but it may be becoming a habit i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.400" end="01:25:03.520" style="s2">like it but it&#39;s oddly hard to stop</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:05.920" style="s2">these activities seem to creep up</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.520" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">i feel very much this way about about</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.920" end="01:25:10.400" style="s2">alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.639" end="01:25:11.840" style="s2">actually um and you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.400" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">the person asking the question begins</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.840" end="01:25:15.040" style="s2">when i turn to the outdoors you know i</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:18.080" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:20.400" style="s2">i am feeling the end of summer coming</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:21.440" style="s2">and i was lucky enough to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.400" end="01:25:23.679" style="s2">have the time</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.440" end="01:25:25.360" style="s2">to get up early this morning and strap a</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.679" end="01:25:27.520" style="s2">paddleboard on the top of the car and go</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.360" end="01:25:31.120" style="s2">out to the willamette and spend an hour</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.520" end="01:25:33.679" style="s2">on the water that</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.120" end="01:25:36.639" style="s2">changed my outlook on the day until i</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.679" end="01:25:36.639" style="s2">got back on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.199" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">but certainly if you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.480" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">do that not that particularly</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:45.120" style="s2">necessarily but they&#39;re you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">already it was pretty early and there</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.120" end="01:25:48.000" style="s2">were already so many people out there</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:51.360" style="s2">families</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.000" end="01:25:54.080" style="s2">um with kids fishing fishermen</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.360" end="01:25:54.960" style="s2">people in kayaks not too many at that</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.080" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.960" end="01:26:01.440" style="s2">people with jet skis and such um</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:04.719" style="s2">and it really is healing but also</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.440" end="01:26:06.960" style="s2">figure out what else you do</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.719" end="01:26:08.159" style="s2">to feel your best and most complete self</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.960" end="01:26:11.600" style="s2">you know do do you</p>

<p begin="01:26:17.679" end="01:26:22.239" style="s2">and can you either do more of that or</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.320" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">expand your ability to do it you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.239" end="01:26:26.880" style="s2">hone your skills</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">so you know it was sort of it became a</p>

<p begin="01:26:32.000" end="01:26:35.199" style="s2">and because of your gluten sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.840" end="01:26:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not something that i ended up</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.199" end="01:26:37.520" style="s2">doing i probably</p>

<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:00.239" style="s2">making you know making things out of</p>

<p begin="01:27:00.239" end="01:27:03.040" style="s2">metal or</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">you know anything just there there are</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.040" end="01:27:07.360" style="s2">so many</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:09.520" style="s2">ways i think that you can expand what it</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.360" end="01:27:12.800" style="s2">is that you were finding value in</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.520" end="01:27:15.440" style="s2">and it probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.800" end="01:27:16.719" style="s2">completely replace alcohol and maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.440" end="01:27:18.880" style="s2">porn although i would</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.719" end="01:27:21.280" style="s2">i would advocate that that you should</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.880" end="01:27:24.719" style="s2">try to completely replace the porn</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.280" end="01:27:27.199" style="s2">um but it will probably lessen the pull</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.719" end="01:27:28.000" style="s2">on you you will probably feel less than</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.199" end="01:27:30.400" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:32.800" style="s2">at some point every day yeah i could</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:35.920" style="s2">really go for a drink right now</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.800" end="01:27:37.760" style="s2">all right two things to add yeah one i</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.920" end="01:27:38.880" style="s2">saw an interesting where was it reddit</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.760" end="01:27:41.920" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:44.239" style="s2">um expose or maybe it was the response</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.920" end="01:27:47.600" style="s2">to one of these ask reddit questions</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.239" end="01:27:50.639" style="s2">about the amount of exploitation</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.600" end="01:27:54.080" style="s2">of young people uh involved</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.639" end="01:27:56.639" style="s2">in the porn industry um</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.080" end="01:27:58.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s hurting people right so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.639" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">basic answer is look if it&#39;s hurting</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.159" end="01:28:03.600" style="s2">people that&#39;s probably incentive enough</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:06.880" style="s2">not to participate right because by</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.600" end="01:28:08.880" style="s2">by consuming it you are driving</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.880" end="01:28:10.639" style="s2">that harm to continue and you have an</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.880" end="01:28:13.840" style="s2">alternative on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.639" end="01:28:14.880" style="s2">um other front the alcohol front it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.840" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">great if you can take</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.880" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">days off also if you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.440" end="01:28:21.440" style="s2">take days off</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.239" end="01:28:22.400" style="s2">less is better and here&#39;s an a solution</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.440" end="01:28:25.600" style="s2">based on your</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.400" end="01:28:27.520" style="s2">scenario here a</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.600" end="01:28:29.199" style="s2">i can&#39;t drink beer anymore uh because of</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.520" end="01:28:31.679" style="s2">the gluten thing but um</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.199" end="01:28:33.040" style="s2">pint of cider or a pint of beer followed</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.679" end="01:28:35.520" style="s2">by a bike ride</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.040" end="01:28:37.280" style="s2">it&#39;s really in some ways kind of ideal</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.520" end="01:28:38.800" style="s2">maybe not in heavy traffic</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.280" end="01:28:40.880" style="s2">right well but you wouldn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.800" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">biking heavy traffic anyway so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.880" end="01:28:45.360" style="s2">consider instead of having two or three</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.199" end="01:28:47.840" style="s2">pints have one pint and go for a ride</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.360" end="01:28:49.840" style="s2">and see if it doesn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.840" end="01:28:51.440" style="s2">get you there with half the consumption</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.840" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">yeah well i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.440" end="01:28:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s also true for alcohol like almost</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.600" end="01:28:57.199" style="s2">all drugs</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.560" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">um that taking a break makes the effects</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.199" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">when you go back to it um</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.719" end="01:29:02.159" style="s2">more interesting and powerful anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:04.080" style="s2">you know it&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.159" end="01:29:06.719" style="s2">done this but for many years</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.080" end="01:29:08.719" style="s2">i would i started and and and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.719" end="01:29:10.639" style="s2">decided to adopt as well a habit of</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.719" end="01:29:11.920" style="s2">saying okay every month</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.639" end="01:29:13.760" style="s2">every month is going to be at least one</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.920" end="01:29:15.440" style="s2">a week with no alcohol at all and</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.760" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">you know no drinking more than what was</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.440" end="01:29:18.320" style="s2">it two days in a row or some two days or</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.040" end="01:29:19.920" style="s2">three days in a row i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.320" end="01:29:22.560" style="s2">exactly what the rules were but it just</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.920" end="01:29:24.000" style="s2">you know it keeps you keeps you honest</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.560" end="01:29:25.520" style="s2">and it also means that when you go back</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">to it you&#39;ll actually feel it more</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.520" end="01:29:28.800" style="s2">and you enjoy it more and you know what</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:30.560" style="s2">are you doing it if if you&#39;re only doing</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.800" end="01:29:34.000" style="s2">it to numb the pain</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.560" end="01:29:36.400" style="s2">uh then there are there are bigger</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.000" end="01:29:39.199" style="s2">issues and probably hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.400" end="01:29:40.639" style="s2">uh for for someone in enough control um</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.199" end="01:29:43.760" style="s2">to write this question</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.639" end="01:29:44.159" style="s2">there are some better ways to um to find</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.760" end="01:29:46.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.159" end="01:29:50.159" style="s2">get rid of some of the pain yep think of</p>
