<p begin="00:00:03.330" end="00:00:08.129" style="s2">stoicism is an ancient Greek scholar</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.580" end="00:00:11.100" style="s2">force it was founded in Athens and 300</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.129" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">BCE and it was influenced by Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.100" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">and its central teaching is that virtue</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">is the only true goods and what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">really means is that what we do with our</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">character is the most important thing in</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:26.070" style="s2">life it&#39;s much more important than</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">health wealth reputation or other things</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">that befall us because wealth is only</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">good if you use it wisely and virtuously</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.129" style="s2">and the same with all these external</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">opportunities in life so Stoics think</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.129" end="00:00:39.900" style="s2">the things that people chase after in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">life are only really a value if you use</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.900" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">them wisely and therefore wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:45.630" style="s2">virtue of strength of character is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">most important thing in life and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.630" end="00:00:51.320" style="s2">should all learn ways to focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">and cultivator stoicism means to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.320" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">taking control of your life or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">focusing on what&#39;s in control in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:05.399" style="s2">life and acting accordingly what comes</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.829" style="s2">to mind is genre Vicki&#39;s term of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.399" end="00:01:09.719" style="s2">meaning crisis there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.829" end="00:01:13.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack of meaning in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.719" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">and stoicism amongst all these other</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.079" end="00:01:17.650" style="s2">different life stances and philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:22.090" style="s2">like Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.650" end="00:01:25.120" style="s2">or existentialism is highly relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.090" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">the meaning crisis because if you adopt</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.120" end="00:01:30.370" style="s2">the stoic standpoint then the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:33.490" style="s2">you&#39;re living with purpose kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.370" end="00:01:35.290" style="s2">a way to deal with what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.490" end="00:01:37.750" style="s2">human and to deal with like I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.290" end="00:01:39.490" style="s2">chaos that is kind of life right now so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">things get thrown at you all the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.490" end="00:01:44.590" style="s2">there&#39;s adversity and almost life is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">bunch of kind of problems you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.590" end="00:01:48.100" style="s2">almost say that we have to kind of solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:50.770" style="s2">so I think stoicism is developing to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.100" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">is a way to look at situations that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.770" end="00:01:56.080" style="s2">arise in my life and how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">them in a more skillful meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.080" end="00:02:01.900" style="s2">to me and what it means to be I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.790" style="s2">human that&#39;s kind of and we say in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.900" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">accordance with nature it&#39;s no zone but</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.790" end="00:02:08.619" style="s2">someone that really kind of responds</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.840" style="s2">skillfully to situations to to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.619" end="00:02:12.280" style="s2">better person and whatever that means so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.840" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.280" end="00:02:16.660" style="s2">long-winded way to say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:19.750" style="s2">stoicism to me really is an approach to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.660" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">life and how to deal with the various</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.750" end="00:02:25.420" style="s2">things that arise whether Pleasant or</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">unpleasant so to speak is a personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.420" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2">philosophy so it begins with you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">ideally if everybody started practicing</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">so it is more a similar philosophy this</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:37.450" style="s2">is not the only answer I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.870" end="00:02:38.739" style="s2">there are others out there you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.450" end="00:02:40.630" style="s2">since the point is to become a better</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.739" end="00:02:42.580" style="s2">person hey if everybody were to become a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.630" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">better person I think there&#39;ll be a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.580" end="00:02:48.970" style="s2">good beginning to were a better a better</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.250" end="00:02:51.400" style="s2">world that said some stoic ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.970" end="00:02:52.870" style="s2">direct social consequences one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.400" end="00:02:55.090" style="s2">fundamental stoic ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.870" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2">cosmopolitanism the notion that we all</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.090" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">brothers and sisters just by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.640" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">being members of the human race which</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">means that we should be far more</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">tolerant about you know foreigners and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:08.950" style="s2">involve international relations than we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:11.800" style="s2">tend to be so so those are actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.950" end="00:03:12.980" style="s2">direct political implications of a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.800" end="00:03:15.950" style="s2">outlook</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.980" end="00:03:17.330" style="s2">stoicism to me is about choice like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.950" end="00:03:20.390" style="s2">lot of times we go through our lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.330" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">kind of reacting to things and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.390" end="00:03:26.180" style="s2">really attracted to sources and because</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">it gave me kind of a framework in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.180" end="00:03:31.250" style="s2">I could be better at making choices that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:33.140" style="s2">are in line with my values and being a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.250" end="00:03:34.880" style="s2">good person I really that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.140" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">important to me and you can&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.880" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">you&#39;re reacting to things over time it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">is a way of having more agency over my</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:48.790" style="s2">life and being able to recognize what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:53.510" style="s2">can and cannot control in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.790" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">being able to focus on being connected</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.510" end="00:04:01.010" style="s2">to who I really am my deeper wishes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">a practice where I can not get off track</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:05.530" style="s2">and sort of stay connected to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:08.690" style="s2">really matters to me and what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.530" end="00:04:12.519" style="s2">correct and what actions are the best to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.690" end="00:04:15.140" style="s2">do and control my thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.519" end="00:04:17.989" style="s2">acknowledge my emotion so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.320" end="00:04:27.110" style="s2">just a way to live my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.530" end="00:04:30.680" style="s2">she says it&#39;s a set of sort of values</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:35.930" style="s2">and my actions historically stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:37.400" style="s2">an ancient Greek philosophy which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.930" end="00:04:40.010" style="s2">concerned about living the best life you</p>

<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:05:00.140" style="s2">how I should conduct myself and it gives</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:02.840" style="s2">me a set of criteria to help me make</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.140" end="00:05:04.640" style="s2">difficult decisions primarily that being</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:37.210" style="s2">time it really merely resonated with me</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:39.010" style="s2">particularly Epictetus so I I took it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.210" end="00:05:41.350" style="s2">seriously from the beginning I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.010" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">take it as just let me read this thing</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.230" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve become far more calm about a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:59.560" style="s2">that often I seem to be able to deal</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.560" end="00:06:04.300" style="s2">and I just have a more positive outlook</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.480" end="00:06:06.610" style="s2">about things because I tend to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.300" end="00:06:08.200" style="s2">the things around in my control and try</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.610" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">to train myself to accept everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.200" end="00:06:18.640" style="s2">else as it comes it&#39;s definitely helped</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:21.880" style="s2">me to to recognize when I&#39;m feeling</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:33.670" style="s2">dissociate from that in a healthy way so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:35.380" style="s2">that I can think straight and make the</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.380" end="00:06:40.420" style="s2">helped me to understand acceptance and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.470" end="00:06:43.630" style="s2">and what I have to accept because I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.420" end="00:06:46.870" style="s2">don&#39;t have control over and what I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.630" end="00:06:50.230" style="s2">have control over it&#39;s really helped me</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.870" end="00:06:53.260" style="s2">to hone in on that and to improve my own</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.260" end="00:06:56.860" style="s2">given me more peace in my life</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.780" end="00:07:00.100" style="s2">throughout my life I&#39;ve really been</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.860" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">looking for meaning in so many different</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.100" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">places and I you know I dabbled in</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:08.170" style="s2">religion a little bit Buddhism but</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">nothing ever truly resonated with me and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.170" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:14.130" style="s2">as soon as I came across stoicism it</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:16.229" style="s2">just immediately resonated with me and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.130" end="00:07:18.389" style="s2">was able to apply it to my life and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.229" end="00:07:22.229" style="s2">actually been able to notice some real</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.389" end="00:07:23.940" style="s2">difference in applying it when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.229" end="00:07:25.320" style="s2">high school I mean I&#39;ve always been kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.940" end="00:07:28.530" style="s2">of a deep thinker</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:30.690" style="s2">and I came across the quote the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.530" end="00:07:32.490" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.690" end="00:07:35.220" style="s2">I remember that being one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.490" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">quotes as a kid and I had absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.220" end="00:07:40.470" style="s2">idea that it was based in stoicism until</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:43.100" style="s2">probably two months ago so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.470" end="00:07:43.100" style="s2">that was pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.069" end="00:07:52.670" style="s2">so what kind of person would find</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.980" end="00:07:55.070" style="s2">some useful in their lives someone who</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.670" end="00:07:58.200" style="s2">recognizes that the world is a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.070" end="00:08:00.480" style="s2">complex and uncertain place but still</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.200" end="00:08:03.150" style="s2">wants to be effective in it I think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.480" end="00:08:05.910" style="s2">really gives people a sense of a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:07.770" style="s2">and really like core tools that they can</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.910" end="00:08:09.480" style="s2">use in their life and personally I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.770" end="00:08:11.550" style="s2">interested in psychiatry and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.480" end="00:08:13.500" style="s2">currently a medical student so I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.550" end="00:08:15.150" style="s2">drawing a lot of parallels myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.500" end="00:08:17.310" style="s2">between like mental illness like anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.150" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">and depression and how a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.310" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">things that Stokes have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:23.760" style="s2">about for thousands thousand years like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">make up such a core part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.760" end="00:08:28.470" style="s2">psychotherapy we use so like CBT rebt</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.690" style="s2">like a whole bunch of basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.470" end="00:08:32.250" style="s2">therapies like go on this core principle</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.690" end="00:08:34.590" style="s2">of like what do I really control in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.250" end="00:08:36.330" style="s2">life and so that&#39;s really like the big</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.590" end="00:08:38.460" style="s2">take home for me has been how exciting</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.330" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">stoicism is right now and how much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.460" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">needed especially in today&#39;s day and age</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:45.150" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really interesting the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:48.330" style="s2">relationship between cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.150" end="00:08:50.280" style="s2">behavioral therapy and stoicism I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.330" end="00:08:52.290" style="s2">read a lot of books on cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.280" end="00:08:54.960" style="s2">behavioral therapy in the past and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.290" end="00:08:56.610" style="s2">never really knew the connection but</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.960" end="00:08:59.940" style="s2">once I actually found out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.610" end="00:09:02.550" style="s2">connection it sort of sent me down a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.940" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">path of learning stoicism and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.550" end="00:09:07.500" style="s2">resonated with me way more than CBT did</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:09.990" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s really I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.500" end="00:09:12.750" style="s2">that&#39;s really applicable to treating</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.990" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">mental health issues or anxiety issues</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.750" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">for me personally I&#39;ve dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">anxiety my whole life and stoicism has</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:21.750" style="s2">been the first thing that I could</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:23.870" style="s2">actually apply to my life and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:27.140" style="s2">actually seen</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:29.270" style="s2">you know everyone has the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.140" end="00:09:31.850" style="s2">getting stuck in traffic or getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.270" end="00:09:34.400" style="s2">stuck on the TTC you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.850" end="00:09:35.690" style="s2">no one likes it everyone grumbles I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.400" end="00:09:39.890" style="s2">actually surprised that people who kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.690" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">of you know kind of deal with it in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.890" end="00:09:44.750" style="s2">very a good way and I noticed that when</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:47.000" style="s2">that happens to me now instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.750" end="00:09:48.920" style="s2">flaring up I kind of use that as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.000" end="00:09:51.290" style="s2">opportunity to exercise services and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.920" end="00:09:53.390" style="s2">kind of maybe do something else maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:55.160" style="s2">interact with someone next to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.390" end="00:09:57.650" style="s2">felt like that&#39;s a that&#39;s like I needed</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.160" end="00:10:01.010" style="s2">break in my kind of everyday kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.650" end="00:10:02.780" style="s2">grind and just it&#39;s like a instigator to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.010" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">do something different at that time I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:07.970" style="s2">think that&#39;s really cool your story got</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:09.710" style="s2">you to be tested every day no matter</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.970" end="00:10:12.260" style="s2">what the occurrence is from the minor</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.710" end="00:10:15.080" style="s2">irritations of day-to-day life to the to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:17.300" style="s2">the big deals right the biggest deal of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.080" end="00:10:19.640" style="s2">the mob probably is death right we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.300" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">face death and Seneca famously said that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.640" end="00:10:23.810" style="s2">death is going to be the ultimate test</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">of your character are you gonna be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.810" end="00:10:26.650" style="s2">you know how how are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:31.010" style="s2">approach it how are you gonna behave</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.650" end="00:10:32.990" style="s2">when that moment comes in between you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.010" end="00:10:34.690" style="s2">know the mundane everyday irritations</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.990" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">and the ultimate test of your character</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.690" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">there are some other major challenges</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:42.860" style="s2">right so one of my major challenges is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:45.560" style="s2">to become a better teacher and you treat</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.860" end="00:10:48.140" style="s2">my students better in a way that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.560" end="00:10:50.180" style="s2">good for them in a way that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:51.820" style="s2">to grow and and not in a way that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.180" end="00:10:53.740" style="s2">please me because that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.820" end="00:10:55.850" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.740" end="00:10:58.190" style="s2">teachers are trained to think that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.850" end="00:11:00.440" style="s2">know best and then unless the students</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.190" end="00:11:01.880" style="s2">sort of lined up with that ideal the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.440" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">students not doing well but it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.880" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">there are many different ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:09.890" style="s2">well and so coming to my job with a more</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:12.230" style="s2">open-minded attitude and a little more</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:14.660" style="s2">tolerant attitude so what are the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.230" end="00:11:16.130" style="s2">think and how they behave it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.660" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">challenge but it&#39;s a good one social</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:21.020" style="s2">challenges that people face that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:22.790" style="s2">can apply stoicism to dealing with peer</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.020" end="00:11:25.390" style="s2">review so people have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.790" end="00:11:28.250" style="s2">criticism and their work for example and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.390" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">maybe partly because a modern culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.250" end="00:11:33.350" style="s2">you know it seems like people have lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">some of the social skills like because</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.350" end="00:11:35.810" style="s2">they spend more time with social media I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.810" end="00:11:40.820" style="s2">and stoicism helps people to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:44.150" style="s2">develop social skills ways of coping</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.820" end="00:11:46.550" style="s2">with criticisms learning not to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.150" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">swayed too much by praise learning not</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.550" end="00:11:50.960" style="s2">to be hot or offended too much by</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">criticism and generally coping with</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.960" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">workplace situations and dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:58.100" style="s2">stress more effectively but stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">also provides general purpose emotional</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.100" end="00:12:02.330" style="s2">resilience strategies that can help</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">people deal with difficult health</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.330" end="00:12:07.730" style="s2">situations like undergoing surgery cope</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:10.100" style="s2">with old age dealing with relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.730" end="00:12:12.020" style="s2">breakups any type of situation really</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.100" end="00:12:14.630" style="s2">that could potentially be stressful</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.020" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">stoicism can offer people our way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.630" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">navigating</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.370" end="00:12:25.080" style="s2">I actually there&#39;s a bear</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.150" end="00:12:26.820" style="s2">need for it in youth today so especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.080" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">I talk about toughness about my friends</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.820" end="00:12:30.779" style="s2">a lot I used to be a camp counselor</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:32.400" style="s2">needs to work directly with youth in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.779" end="00:12:34.529" style="s2">like so much of their lives now revolve</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.400" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">around Instagram and what&#39;s really out</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.529" end="00:12:38.040" style="s2">of their control so whether people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:39.420" style="s2">gonna like their photos what people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.040" end="00:12:41.850" style="s2">gonna comment what they think and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.420" end="00:12:43.980" style="s2">think especially in some adolescents</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.850" end="00:12:47.430" style="s2">work I&#39;ve done mental illness wise</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:49.140" style="s2">there&#39;s such a big kind of weight that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.430" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">would almost describe of like what do</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.140" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">people think of me are they gonna judge</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:55.740" style="s2">me and I really think that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.860" end="00:12:57.089" style="s2">start to teach youth these coping skills</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.740" end="00:13:00.330" style="s2">and these skills of how to be resilient</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.089" end="00:13:01.830" style="s2">how to understand what people think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.330" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">you and whether or not you have control</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.830" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">over that and what you can do for</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:08.190" style="s2">yourself I actually think there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:09.650" style="s2">big help that it would have on a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.650" end="00:13:13.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve met natural stores you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.390" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">were just natural historic but even</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.800" end="00:13:16.440" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have that natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:22.220" style="s2">ability they probably need it the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.440" end="00:13:24.750" style="s2">so people who are finance themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.220" end="00:13:28.200" style="s2">apologizing to people every week not</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.750" end="00:13:30.209" style="s2">being able to control the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.200" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">I think that&#39;s those type of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.209" end="00:13:34.500" style="s2">probably needed the most and I I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:37.020" style="s2">consider myself having been one of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.500" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">so I definitely recommend it to people I</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.020" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">see that can&#39;t control their responses</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:44.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a gap between the stimulus and</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.780" end="00:13:59.980" style="s2">response and choose your response and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:01.720" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a really powerful idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.980" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">we don&#39;t get taught that in school</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.720" end="00:14:05.980" style="s2">really but it&#39;s it&#39;s huge for being a</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.980" end="00:14:09.850" style="s2">became and I think is really important</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.020" end="00:14:38.520" style="s2">great way to say it&#39;s not always roses</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:03.710" style="s2">movement so I think it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.880" end="00:15:05.870" style="s2">continue growing and continue getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.710" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">bigger throughout the years and for my</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.870" end="00:15:12.950" style="s2">part in stoic on Toronto our stoic on X</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.620" end="00:15:15.350" style="s2">Toronto yearly we&#39;re gonna host events</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.950" end="00:15:17.900" style="s2">and hopefully they have a great turnout</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.350" end="00:15:19.940" style="s2">and a great vibe like this one happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.900" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">well I see stoic on access is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.940" end="00:15:25.310" style="s2">important part of the international</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.490" end="00:15:27.860" style="s2">growth of the tourism in general the</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.860" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">the major story con is great it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.510" end="00:15:34.700" style="s2">of fun but it&#39;s only one day once a year</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:36.500" style="s2">and you know because of logistics only a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.700" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">few hundred people cannot can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.500" end="00:15:42.260" style="s2">attend so to have these historic on axis</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">all over the world potentially in dozens</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.260" end="00:15:46.100" style="s2">and dozens of different cities that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:47.870" style="s2">actually reaches a much larger audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:51.260" style="s2">it makes the whole thing much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.870" end="00:15:52.790" style="s2">flexible you can organize stoical on</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.260" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">axis around practices or around</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.790" end="00:15:58.550" style="s2">discussions or about theories or about</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:16:00.710" style="s2">you know local maybe faculty from</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:02.390" style="s2">universities that that are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.710" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">ancient philosophy there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.390" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">ways of doing it so stoic on axis is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:09.320" style="s2">vital I think for the International</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:10.580" style="s2">growth of the stoic movement a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.320" end="00:16:12.230" style="s2">positive feedback from this conference</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.580" end="00:16:13.490" style="s2">like I haven&#39;t been to many conferences</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.230" end="00:16:15.650" style="s2">but from what I&#39;ve heard from people</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.490" end="00:16:18.350" style="s2">talking so far it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.650" end="00:16:20.870" style="s2">successful world and I&#39;m just impressed</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.350" end="00:16:22.490" style="s2">that people were so they came out you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.870" end="00:16:24.830" style="s2">know going to put money into it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">engage with people just like talk and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.830" end="00:16:29.690" style="s2">discuss these ideas and one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:32.690" style="s2">really got out of it and said you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.690" end="00:16:33.950" style="s2">if you if you passionate about something</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.690" end="00:16:35.510" style="s2">you will find other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.950" end="00:16:38.510" style="s2">passionate about that thing to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.510" end="00:16:39.830" style="s2">and chances are you will and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.510" end="00:16:41.750" style="s2">beautiful to engage with them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.830" end="00:16:44.710" style="s2">always worth it to try at least and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.750" end="00:16:47.060" style="s2">was success so I&#39;m happy again I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.710" end="00:16:50.300" style="s2">developing community is really important</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.060" end="00:16:51.350" style="s2">I think you know you might find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.300" end="00:16:52.640" style="s2">being passionate about something but</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.350" end="00:16:54.860" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of stuck in your own world</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.640" end="00:16:58.250" style="s2">and people around you&#39;re not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.860" end="00:17:00.200" style="s2">engage with you in that topic and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.250" end="00:17:01.820" style="s2">like you can just you can find people</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.200" end="00:17:03.050" style="s2">that are passionate about the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.820" end="00:17:04.790" style="s2">things you&#39;re passionate about them fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.050" end="00:17:06.199" style="s2">and create those communities and make</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.790" end="00:17:08.350" style="s2">the effort if what inspiration doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.199" end="00:17:11.720" style="s2">work try again try something else and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.350" end="00:17:13.070" style="s2">I&#39;m really grateful that Peter and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.720" end="00:17:14.060" style="s2">other organizers were able to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.070" end="00:17:16.280" style="s2">something like this together</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.060" end="00:17:18.949" style="s2">I think silicon X is absolutely gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.280" end="00:17:20.990" style="s2">grow this is one of the best conferences</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.949" end="00:17:23.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve been to and what unifies it is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.990" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">people are a bunch of you who are really</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.780" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">interested in this topic but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:30.980" style="s2">have been engaging on their own they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.930" style="s2">been reading books they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.980" end="00:17:34.850" style="s2">listening to lectures perhaps that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.930" end="00:17:36.590" style="s2">very private and it changes when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.850" end="00:17:38.180" style="s2">enter a community when you enter a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.590" end="00:17:40.460" style="s2">community of people bounce ideas off of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.180" end="00:17:42.050" style="s2">you have people to relate to people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:45.380" style="s2">help you with their own experience on</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.050" end="00:17:49.160" style="s2">that is that is hugely beneficial for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.380" end="00:17:51.770" style="s2">your own practice and it&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.160" end="00:17:53.150" style="s2">a really rewarding experience to see how</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.770" end="00:17:54.350" style="s2">other people are actually into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.150" end="00:17:57.730" style="s2">other people are benefiting from this</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.350" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">too and and I can learn from them so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.730" end="00:18:04.630" style="s2">this this idea of taking the theory out</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">of the classroom or out of the study and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.630" end="00:18:09.290" style="s2">taking philosophy into your life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:11.060" style="s2">huge and stoicism that&#39;s what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:13.070" style="s2">seen in still contacts you&#39;ve seen what</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.060" end="00:18:15.020" style="s2">we want we want to motivate people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.070" end="00:18:16.850" style="s2">get out and talk about it and relate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.020" end="00:18:18.770" style="s2">each other and hopefully build</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.850" end="00:18:22.610" style="s2">connections that they can then network</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.770" end="00:18:25.010" style="s2">and do something from that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">the value is there as long as the value</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.010" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">is there it&#39;s going to continue to grow</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:29.930" style="s2">I think Stuart connects we do it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:31.820" style="s2">several different cities around the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.930" end="00:18:33.800" style="s2">world each year and I think increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.820" end="00:18:36.650" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen is that when</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.800" end="00:18:38.540" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a successful school context or</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.650" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">maybe the means to a con conference in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.540" end="00:18:43.370" style="s2">city it kind of seeds something and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:45.980" style="s2">there seems to be increasingly an</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.370" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">opportunity to have a regular annual</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.980" end="00:18:50.030" style="s2">so here we have the meetup group that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:51.140" style="s2">meets every month or so and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.030" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">we&#39;re getting to the point where we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.140" end="00:18:56.390" style="s2">install clinics in Toronto as a regular</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:58.430" style="s2">annual thing and then maybe the main</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.390" end="00:19:00.950" style="s2">store corn conference would come back</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.430" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">here you know every five ten years or</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.950" end="00:19:05.210" style="s2">something as well I think because it</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:08.180" style="s2">seems like the audience is just growing</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.210" end="00:19:10.490" style="s2">year on year and Toronto in particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.180" end="00:19:12.980" style="s2">is one of the areas where the for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.490" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">whatever reason those are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.980" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">interest maybe even less may even be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:19.610" style="s2">city where there&#39;s more interest than</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:22.130" style="s2">anybody else in sources in Toronto New</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.610" end="00:19:26.230" style="s2">York are probably the two main cities</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.130" end="00:19:26.230" style="s2">where students become a hot subject</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.190" end="00:19:35.759" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely a movement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.929" end="00:19:37.799" style="s2">definitely something that is a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:19.109" style="s2">philosophy I mean there are leaders in</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.979" end="00:20:24.659" style="s2">study this whole thing over several</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.019" end="00:20:26.489" style="s2">years ago in London there are the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.659" end="00:20:28.979" style="s2">that organize the stoic on in stoic week</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.489" end="00:20:30.659" style="s2">and the various local stoic own axis so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.979" end="00:20:32.609" style="s2">in that sense there are organizations</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.659" end="00:20:34.679" style="s2">there is something like my friend Greg</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.409" end="00:20:44.489" style="s2">sense is very much an organized movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:46.739" style="s2">of course there is no membership cards</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.489" end="00:20:48.840" style="s2">like you go around with a card that says</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.889" end="00:20:57.419" style="s2">is an effort by a number of people a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.779" end="00:20:59.549" style="s2">growing number of people to spread the</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.549" end="00:21:04.019" style="s2">helpful to people and if poor people</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.559" end="00:21:05.999" style="s2">heard of it and started practicing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.019" end="00:21:07.320" style="s2">you know there&#39;ll be to their benefit I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.999" end="00:21:10.200" style="s2">think part of the reason for this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.320" end="00:21:12.599" style="s2">that people like this idea that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.200" end="00:21:15.419" style="s2">accountable and they&#39;re responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.599" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">the quality of their own life in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.419" end="00:21:20.129" style="s2">ways that&#39;s a scary concept but in other</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:21.720" style="s2">ways very empowering because it means</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.129" end="00:21:22.409" style="s2">that the quality of your life is not up</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.720" end="00:21:24.359" style="s2">to luck</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.409" end="00:21:25.950" style="s2">it&#39;s up to the decisions you make and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.359" end="00:21:28.349" style="s2">the way you deal with what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.950" end="00:21:31.349" style="s2">you so as a movement I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.349" end="00:21:33.389" style="s2">looking for someone to tell them that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.349" end="00:21:36.869" style="s2">hey you can improve your lot you can you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.389" end="00:21:38.220" style="s2">can fix him and help your circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.869" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">or at least the way you react to those</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.220" end="00:21:41.190" style="s2">that&#39;s within your grasp and here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.169" style="s2">set of tools on how to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.190" end="00:21:45.720" style="s2">some people are naturally latching onto</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.169" end="00:21:49.289" style="s2">that and benefiting from it I think it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.720" end="00:21:53.549" style="s2">is a movement I first got into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.289" end="00:21:57.269" style="s2">in 2014 when Massimo penuche was</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.549" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">speaking on CBC radio a program that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.269" end="00:22:03.389" style="s2">listened to and at that time there were</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:05.249" style="s2">not a lot of people into it it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.389" end="00:22:08.129" style="s2">really just an ancient philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.249" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">academics studied and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.129" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">really really picking up in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.759" style="s2">practical use and practice of it so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:15.869" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s becoming a movement I</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.759" end="00:22:18.059" style="s2">think it&#39;s really excited</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.869" end="00:22:20.940" style="s2">I&#39;m sure the reason why I came across</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.059" end="00:22:22.830" style="s2">stoicism was because it is becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.940" end="00:22:25.019" style="s2">of a movement because I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.830" end="00:22:29.299" style="s2">Asian philosophy but it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.019" end="00:22:29.299" style="s2">applicable to modern life</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.830" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">the stoicism is something that at first</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.380" end="00:22:36.860" style="s2">might seem a little bit intimidating to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:39.020" style="s2">people because it&#39;s all these ancient</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.860" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">texts it&#39;s easy to see these statues of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.020" end="00:22:43.430" style="s2">like Greek philosophers and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:44.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t know about that but really when</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.430" end="00:22:47.240" style="s2">you kind of look at it it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.840" end="00:22:49.160" style="s2">something that I think supersedes all</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.240" end="00:22:50.900" style="s2">religion and all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.160" end="00:22:52.280" style="s2">schools of thought because it really is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.900" end="00:22:53.960" style="s2">just a central principle and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.280" end="00:22:55.250" style="s2">just a way of life so I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.960" end="00:22:57.170" style="s2">when I first read it I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.250" end="00:22:59.390" style="s2">scared I&#39;m like a bit of a science guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.170" end="00:23:01.190" style="s2">of in medicine I don&#39;t really know how</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.390" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">much I can buy with this philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.190" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">I always avoided but really once you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">start to dig into it it&#39;s really just</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:08.900" style="s2">like a way to deal with life and a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:10.970" style="s2">to explore what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.900" end="00:23:13.240" style="s2">what it means to live a good life</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:16.820" style="s2">whatever that means</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.240" end="00:23:18.920" style="s2">stoicism 101 you have a limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.820" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">of attention you have a limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.920" end="00:23:24.890" style="s2">of energy that&#39;s a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:28.160" style="s2">biological fact so the question is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.890" end="00:23:30.830" style="s2">even necessarily you know what is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.160" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">can I focus on what what deserves to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.830" end="00:23:35.660" style="s2">focused on what is the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:38.690" style="s2">way to spend your focus and stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.660" end="00:23:41.030" style="s2">tells you and this has been used by</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:42.770" style="s2">military by athletes by by people for</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.030" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">generations the most effective way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.770" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2">spend your focus is by orienting it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:49.220" style="s2">towards what you have control over and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:52.220" style="s2">what is up to you and by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:54.200" style="s2">you&#39;re just in a better position to deal</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.220" end="00:23:58.040" style="s2">with the chaos the chaos perhaps does</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.200" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">not go away at least not the start but</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.040" end="00:24:02.090" style="s2">you are you are stacking the cards in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:04.820" style="s2">your favor and you&#39;re taking the tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.090" end="00:24:06.740" style="s2">you already have and you&#39;re using them</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.820" end="00:24:09.230" style="s2">more effectively and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.740" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">anybody can take just from a 5 minute 10</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.230" end="00:24:12.950" style="s2">minute introduction of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.899" style="s2">there are common misconceptions about</p>

<p begin="00:24:14.899" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">mentioning and addressing one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.299" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">that people think Stoics are unemotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:23.779" style="s2">they confuse it with having a stuff up a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:26.509" style="s2">lot because the word stoicism has come</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.779" end="00:24:28.369" style="s2">to mean being tough minded and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.509" end="00:24:30.919" style="s2">unemotional but usually we spell it with</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:37.669" style="s2">of philosophy which has a much more</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.669" end="00:24:42.379" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the inspiration for modern</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:51.289" style="s2">stoicism is more about replacing</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.289" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">ones and also learning to Rado and</p>
