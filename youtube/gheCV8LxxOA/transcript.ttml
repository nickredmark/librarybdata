<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:21.439" style="s2">welcome back to the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2">the 40th live stream this is the q and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.439" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">section where we engage the questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.320" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">answers hopefully we can match them up</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:30.880" style="s2">well enough that they will satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">one of our cats has come to love these</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.239" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">some cream behind you so that we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">a little bit of cap behind you on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">screen we did no such thing that was you</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:44.719" style="s2">you are a sucker and you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">and i have no idea why he thinks i&#39;m his</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.719" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">mother you are yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.480" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">i have some idea yes all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">uh we&#39;re gonna start with four questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">episode uh 39 and then move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">ones from</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">last hour and then this hour why</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">are the citizens of portland accepting</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">such terrible leadership could this be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">test case for unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">at the local level um this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">good question</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">i thought so i think the people of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">portland are accepting such</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">terrible leadership because</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">people are hell-bent on signaling</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">their priorities their values</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">their virtue in the public context and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">they have no</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">understanding of what i have called the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">personal responsibility vortex which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">if you instantiate your values directly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">in your own life or in your own city you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">may be doing so</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">to the long-term large-scale detriment</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">very values and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">portland needs to demand high quality</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">leadership which involves doing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">right for portland even when it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">perfectly match the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">aspirations of portlanders in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">words you have to get there so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">homelessness is a lovely example of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">um lovely in the game theoretic sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">terrible tragedy but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">um the solutions to homelessness which</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">we absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">should have as a society there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">no defense of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">failure to deal with people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">fallen off the bottom of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">ladder or uh you know for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">but you can&#39;t solve it at the city level</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">and if you try you will make the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">worse and so portland</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">because everybody understands that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">want a solution imagines that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">enact it at any</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">level so i would just point out this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">uh the same failure we see in</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">the blm movement which effectively is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">advocating</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">for reparations in all interactions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">anytime there&#39;s an interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">there should be a flow of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">from one party to another</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">you you can&#39;t do it that way you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">do it in a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it uh in a court there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">certain places that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">you were going to engage in reparations</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">you could do it that would fairly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">distribute</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">uh the costs of the program but if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">do it in every interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">it will produce um counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">results so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">an exact match for unity 2020 at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">local level would be tough</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">uh because whereas the presidency does</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">flip between red and blue</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">and you know even putting aside for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">moment that red and blue did not mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">what they have in the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">and that many of us who have always</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">voted blue are fed up with with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">democrats etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">um cities tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">stuck in one or the other uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">color as it were they tend to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">mayoral leader who&#39;s of one party or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">on and on and on and on and you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s as much true as maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">used to be but certainly i would be very</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know and we haven&#39;t been in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">portland long enough for me to know most</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">of my local history very well</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know when the last time</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">portland had a republican mayor was</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">a unity 2020 exactly mapped onto the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">local level might be tougher</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">but but something that had two people</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">uh who were to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">disagreeing on you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">eight or ten of the top</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">issues that are plaguing the city today</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">running as as a team could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">could be an effective way to bring unity</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">2020 to a local level</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">well i think um there&#39;s no structural</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">mechanism because you don&#39;t have two</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">offices you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">president there&#39;s also that if you if</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">you had vice mayor</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">you could potentially do it but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">have that but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">unity 2020 or let&#39;s just say the unity</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">movement is really about the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">that there is a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">values and that far better than having</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">one side advocate for one value on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">other side advocate for the other value</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">and the pendulum swing back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">between them or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">you know that&#39;s how it works in the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">of circumstances in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">country uh recently it&#39;s done nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">the sort but</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">um you could recognize</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">that the solution involved navigating</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">the tension</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">rather than oscillating between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">extremes</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">at the city level and in fact we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">this very tension at the city level</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">you know business owners and homeowners</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">have one view of things and uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">renters uh will have a very different</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">view of things so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">you could navigate these things um</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">in terms of the unity viewpoint the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">unity perspective but you just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">structurally do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">so anyway yes i think it is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">for us to figure this out and the unity</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">movement should</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">um try to figure out how to map</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">that uh higher order value set onto</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">other other power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">since so many big cities increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">refuse to pursue charges against</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">protesters</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.840" style="s2">in quotes what happens if big city cops</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">just refuse to arrest any</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">anti-protesters</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">and then the the question continues</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">problem solved</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t be solved but it might</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">point to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">the problem with not arresting or</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">pursuing charges against protesters such</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">at least it was revealed to more of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">constituency of a city</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">well yes on the other hand it&#39;s a step</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">what the protesters rioters are</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">demanding is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">a discretionary legal structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">where there&#39;s uh one set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">people for whom the laws apply and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">another set for whom they don&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a reparations program</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">within that context but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">it breaks down into a totally</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">discretionary thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">which will be the uninvention of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">civilization rather than a solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t balance the discretionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">thing on one side with a discretionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">on the other side there&#39;s no stable</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">solution that looks like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">so um you know yes yes certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not a stable solution but could it</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">be used short term</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">as a sort of a hail mary to point out uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">just how bad a policy this is well i</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">expect it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t expect it to be deployed but i</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">um you know i expect you will see</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">you know look you know who wins out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">all this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">the anarchists for a very brief period</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">of time they&#39;re going to get their wish</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">and um we will be if we are lucky we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">will be picking up the pieces for</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">about how long have humans been evolving</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">in caves and handmade shelters and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">has that affected our physiology</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">this could be covered for hours but a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">light explanation for you is sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">thanks are you much so this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">be different</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">for different populations and i actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">uh i did not go back and try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">out when is the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">uh cave living that we think there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">um although gosh there&#39;s some stuff at</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">the southern tip of south africa that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">very old that i think is millions of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">years old that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">evidence like uh shellfish processing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">that might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">in a cave so you know caves versus</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">handmade shelters are are quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">uh answers to this question um</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">and uh but but the question then is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">how might this affect our physiology</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t expect any start date on</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">caves</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">um start date is that what you said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">yeah i mean other animals use caves</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s no reason that there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">human start date that one should</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">expect but the other thing you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">had to have come down out of the out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">the trees</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">we had to have been on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">probably yeah you&#39;re right there are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">a lot of trees in caves therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">but then you have a come down out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">uh date for early primate ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">but it it&#39;s not the answer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">looking for what i would say is if</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in caves i&#39;ve long</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">been interested in caves because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">often house</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">bats you realize that they are so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">patchily distributed</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">that there is no um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">you know caves exist in some places and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">people will certainly use them because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">they provide advantages</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">caves don&#39;t exist in other places people</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">long had mechanisms for doing something</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">let&#39;s make nests you know so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">that that suggests that behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">you could call a man-made structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">stretches back before our split from</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">structure and shelter differently</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of mammals and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">birds and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">even some amphibians and reptiles that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">make nests</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">but shelter and cave you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">i read as</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">underlying this question is are there</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">going to be effects on</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">say ability to regulate to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">thermoregulate</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">or photo period interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re living if you&#39;re sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">inside a structure that either</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">mitigates changes in environment such as</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">temperature</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">and rain and protects you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">which may mostly be a negative from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">direct evidence of the sun and the moon</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">moving throughout through the sky</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">and because it&#39;s been so um</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">so varied throughout human history i</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">doubt that we could find any</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">consistent physiological change as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">result of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">certainly at the point that the vast</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">majority of people are living inside</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">we should expect to see changes in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">ability to acclimate that would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">harder</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">and harder for any of us to you know go</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">out and spend time</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">outdoors for for lengths of time uh but</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s probably at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">individual acclimation rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">long-term evolutionary uh change</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">i would think yeah i mean i think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">the problem is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a continuous uh state of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">being change</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">where um you know at first a cave</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">is basically just a place where the rock</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">overhangs enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">so that the rain doesn&#39;t fall so some</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">space stays dry and you seek shelter</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">which reduces your caloric needs because</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t get wet and because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">get wet you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">losing the uh the energy you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">i think the point is the impacts are</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">much more likely the much</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">and all 10 of them had double yolks</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.760" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">what could possibly explain this</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">chernobyl 2020</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">so the kiev part is is relevant because</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">he posits chernobyl as a possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">which would presumably not be an</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">explanation unless every time you buy</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">free range eggs you&#39;re getting double</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">yolks</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">anything well one thing is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">guard against</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:54.639" style="s2">the the fact is double yolked eggs</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">are not all that uncommon</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.639" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a question about how</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">any seems very unexpected if you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">if it was a completely random process</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">that produced double yolked eggs</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">then you would expect for each you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">if you get one double yolk tag what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">the chances that the next one</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">uh is also double yolked would be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">same percentage and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">multiply these and you get a very low</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">overall percentage well but i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">might be just like in humans some</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">families have propensity towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">twinning</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">yeah right and so some chickens</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">presumably have a propensity towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">double yolking</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">yep and so free-range chickens</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">uh may be more likely to be being</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">produced on smaller farms and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">chances of having a small farm in which</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">a majority of the chickens are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">have this tendency towards double</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">yolking</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">would be higher than if it was coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">from some giant farm um so that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">know just</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">just you know basically drift towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">double yokiness</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">in free range eggs is is possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">because you&#39;re talking about likely a</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">smaller population that you&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">yeah so i what i was going to get at is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">the individual likelihoods if they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">all multiplied together</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">seem very low you can&#39;t rule it out</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">somebody&#39;s going to get just by chance</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">somebody&#39;s going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">carton at some point and maybe they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">write to somebody and ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">on the other hand a free range doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">mean what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">think right free range is an appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">some idealized</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">version of uh you know chickens</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">chickens going their own way whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">but anyway so the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">these chickens they go somewhere to lay</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">their eggs you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">nest box and uh somebody&#39;s you know your</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">life if</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">one chicken has a propensity to lay</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">double yolked eggs they&#39;re very likely</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">to end up in the same place they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">likely to be collected at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">basically the point is non-independence</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">of yolk points that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">okay excellent um you were saying in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">that two-thirds of one&#39;s ancestors being</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">women is a misunderstanding of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">individual versus population</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually one in two yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">and i do not understand the second the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">actual question here</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">but maybe you will brett isn&#39;t this a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">contradiction since two to the n</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">spots in one&#39;s tree will cover whole</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">in the limit i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some illusion i</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">mean two to the n</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">is obviously mathematical it&#39;s exponents</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">but i don&#39;t understand what we&#39;ll cover</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">a whole subpopulations in the limit</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s referring to it yeah you know i</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">understand this is a mathematical term</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">but i don&#39;t quite get how it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">used here</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">i don&#39;t yeah so maybe we could just say</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">um although probably we&#39;ll just say the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">same thing as we said whenever it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">that we said that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">um this thing that has tried it out a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">lot that oh you know um</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:54.600" style="s2">women make up many more of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">ancestors than men do</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.600" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">misunderstands that even if you come</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">from a population where there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">polygeny which is to say one male mating</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">with a lot of women and a lot of males</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">not leaving any descendants at all</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">that is true at the population level but</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">every individual human being has one</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">father and one mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">and therefore absent incest which yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">can happen but even in strongly</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">pollutionist societies</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">is is pretty rare um absent incest you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">have an equal number of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">yeah so i think the point is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">this two-thirds number if the two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">number is right it does point to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">something important</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">right about mating systems in human</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">history about mating systems in human</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">history and the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">the routine bottlenecking of men yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a very real thing and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">think it&#39;s important the problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">way it&#39;s deployed is often very</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">confusing</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">and so anyway it&#39;s not like we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a non-existent</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a false idea and so so like we just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">don&#39;t know if the two-thirds number is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">right but let&#39;s imagine for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">that two-thirds is the right number here</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">um two-thirds or some such uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">number is true with regard to the</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">it is true that uh at a population level</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">at many moments in human history</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">many more women than men have reproduced</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">it is not true that at any moment in</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">but most of the world is off limits so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">assuming you&#39;re willing to wait a little</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">ecuador really but the ecuador and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">amazon</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">and yeah we could we could just list and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">list a list do you have any just off the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">top of your head</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the i think the real answer is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">right and if if you can&#39;t see it then</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a scale at which you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">and so anyway we have a um</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">a thing that a shorthand we say to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">other about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">that uh creatures elsewhere that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">very exotic to us</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">may be their squirrel that we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">squirrels that we take for granted and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">squirrels are completely fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">creatures they&#39;re behaviorally just out</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">of this world</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">highly intelligent problem-solving and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">amazing to watch and there&#39;s some places</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">you can go you could sit all day and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">watch squirrels and nobody would know</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">what you were doing but</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">um but it&#39;s worthwhile and we just</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">ignore them because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">this is i mean this is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">and you you can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">you can learn a tremendous amount and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">immerse yourself in animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">almost anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">uh but in terms of getting a respite of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">actually getting away you know going</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">into the back country</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">and the us is is still available i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">i think even</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">even backcountry even national parks</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">were shut down for a while but i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">almost all of them are open again</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">um if you know at your own risk so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">if you had the skills to do that for</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">that you need skills that money won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">money won&#39;t solve your problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">um you know don&#39;t don&#39;t go somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">if you really want a respite and escape</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">from the madness of men as you say</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">do not go somewhere that has been</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">americanized in advance for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">which is you know it&#39;s the way most</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">americans tend to travel and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">any place that has uh that is a giant</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">tourist destination for americans</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">i&#39;m assuming you&#39;re american and if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">wrong then this is this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">but any giant tourist destination like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">you know cancun or acapulco or cabo san</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">lucas</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">uh is just going to be like many america</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">except the climate&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">different and other people around you</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">are speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">in spanish although frankly probably not</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">even that much</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">so go somewhere that a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">americans aren&#39;t already swarming to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">at the point that americans are once</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">again swarming places</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">and um not just immerse in nature but</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">also engage with the local people</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">and that is actually a cure for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">uh the madness of humanity you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">madding crowd is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s it is so eye-opening to just</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">interact with people in of a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">in a different language even if you only</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">have a few words but you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">communicate quite a lot and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve spent time we spent time</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">in turkey i don&#39;t know that when</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">when that is going to be safe again but</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">um cappadocia in turkey is extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">uh you know madagascar is is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">in a lot of ways but um unlike any place</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">else on</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">earth and there&#39;s so many places in</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">remarkable</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">what is the risk that people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">perceiving uh to trying it out</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">and seeing seeing if</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">it might make sense and just holding out</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">right so i will say um this</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">mathematically impossible business</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">is entirely predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">the plan</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">was to get on ballots by collecting</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">signatures which that was never the plan</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">we knew that wasn&#39;t going to work</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">in the very beginning if that had been</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">the only mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">then we would never have embarked on</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">it would it would have been unity 2024</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">right exactly um so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">there are other mechanisms and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">mathematically impossible it does get</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">harder there are various points at which</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">of the many mechanisms one drops out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">you know it becomes less likely at a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">structural level</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">but you know if events intervened at</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">this moment yeah it&#39;s still possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">how does your oh no here we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t the corporate backing of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">blm movement demonstrate to the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">the practical benefits of free market</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">capitalism while also alerting the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">to its potential dangers</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">balance is necessary much love to all</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">yeah if we were all in a learning mode i</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s you know that&#39;s that&#39;s apt</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">that this this could be a way for both</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">to learn from to learn about their own</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">blind spots yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">absolutely um increasingly i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">really important</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">that we get careful around the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">capitalism as either a savior or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">villain</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">that you know i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">people mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">by capitalism if they just mean markets</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">then they&#39;re talking nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">because first of all then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">talking nonsense when uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">when they say they&#39;re anti-capitalists</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">anti-capitalist yes yes we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">destroy all markets really forever like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">or until</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">five minutes from now as if markets you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:49.640" style="s2">know haven&#39;t been with us</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">since the you know the first moments of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.640" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">right it&#39;s like oh i mean i can make an</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">argument that other organisms besides</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">humans engage in markets of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">and so the thing is it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">like you know the uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">the cave and shelter thing right which</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">is you know it starts with such a small</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">alteration that you can&#39;t even identify</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">a point on the other hand there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">something about the um the markets that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">now that left to their own devices do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">tremendous amount of harm</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">but you know i really just think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">should turn the question</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">back on people like what exactly is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">that you want to end</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">right because there&#39;s no they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">and the thing is if you are interested</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">in something that would actually deserve</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">the label</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">social justice then markets are your</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:40.240" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">tool right what you need is a market</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:45.600" style="s2">in a context where the incentives result</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">in more just outcomes then the market</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">finds the solution rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">ibram ex candy inventing a solution</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">that&#39;s going to result in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">destruction of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">right but collecting his share oh he</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">he&#39;s a marvelous capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">yes yeah how does your conception of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">geographical and transfer frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">apply to the rest of the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">i can see how the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">geographical frontier could be similar</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">but cannot intuitively apply transfer</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">so this actually fits perfectly with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">previous question</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">so you know what um in what way could we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">argue that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">other organisms besides humans engage in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">in markets</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">or in exchange that looks like markets</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">uh you know just</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">famously to use the one that that</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">exchange uh that is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">a for a but a for b and uh there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">to be constant negotiation between</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">each player in terms of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">they think they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">a good deal and no it&#39;s not conscience</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">conscious when it spiders and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">to some degree some of it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">in bonobo some of it will be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">but not as fully conscious as it is in</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">humans and of course a lot of the trades</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">that we do aren&#39;t conscious and we think</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">because we use language we put this</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">conscious wording on things</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">and um then we forget all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">that&#39;s happening below the surface</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">because we think our words are our</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">truths and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.279" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">yeah um i agree with this and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">that um we talk about mating and dating</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">markets is that this really isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">conscious people are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">uh market-like exchanges even when</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">they find that terminology abhorrent but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">is versed in the technolo and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">terminology can just map it on there</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">very very easily but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got lots of examples</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">that we can find uh within</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">humans in places that we don&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">within other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">in close context like uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">bonobos within their group and all</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">but if you&#39;re willing to look between</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">the stuff is everywhere right every</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">one of these insect or animal pollinated</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">fruit distribution you know creatures or</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">oh so so so what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">you know a bee comes to a flower</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">and gets uh gets nectar and exchange</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">carries gametes to the next flower so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">clear trade but even something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">mixed foraging flocks</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">of different bird species one of whom is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">helping find the food and the other of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">whom is better at</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">alerting against predators like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">kind of exchange as well oh of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">and you know frankly if you and i were</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">to just set about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">task we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">come up with example after example until</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">we literally</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">fell asleep at the microphone because</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to see that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">no you don&#39;t yeah um no and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">market forces will prevent us from doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">that because it wouldn&#39;t be a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:07.600" style="s2">however i mean look we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">even just you right you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.600" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">yeah you all are you um you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">um simultaneously an</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">individual and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">colony of gut flora and you know other</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">creatures that live yeah some of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">are eating right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">well not anymore um but uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">your gut flora are part of a partnership</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">in which they get something</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">and um you very definitely get something</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">the ability to live because of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">activity in</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">your gut and even even your cells</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">your cells are um</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">the composite of two distinct creatures</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">right your mitochondria were at one</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">point free living creatures who took up</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">residence</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">inside of cells that became eukaryotic</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">so you&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">one creature you&#39;re a partnership at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">level of 30 trillion cells each of which</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">have these uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">little once autonomous creatures within</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">uh you know we&#39;ve got networks of um</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">fungi that allow plants to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">um uh extract nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.279" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">from their soil environment and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">an exchange of resources there</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">the exchanges are everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">um anyway a little imagination reveals</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">just how</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">broad a concept it is yeah so i think um</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">we did not actually answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">what was the question which was about</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">transfer frontiers oh and where we see</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">transfer frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">in in non-humans and i think basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">anytime</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">uh you see theft of resource or uh which</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">often manifests as territoriality um</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">that&#39;s effectively a kind of transfer</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">frontier you know we&#39;re talking within</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">um well gosh not even like i can think</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">of just from</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">from my own research i had i had one</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">frog species moving in and stealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">stealing a place in which to rear his</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">his babies from another frog species</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">and once done there was no using that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">resource again until the second frog</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">species had raised his kids and moved on</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">yep so nectar thieves nectar thieves</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">oh yeah hummingbirds that go in at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">base of the flower rather than going in</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">where they&#39;re supposed to and so get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">nectar but don&#39;t pollinate</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">absolutely they&#39;re beautiful but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">diabolical yes nasty nasty hummingbirds</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">i&#39;m a big fan of hummingbirds but yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">they do all sorts of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">steel and in fact i have bad news for</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">animals we&#39;re stuck with it all right we</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">we are not autotrophic right and even</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">those you might</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">be thinking but corals are autotrophic</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">no they&#39;re not because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">might need to define your terms uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">generating their own food so plants are</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">generating</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">uh carbohydrate from sunlight and co2</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">in the atmosphere they&#39;re literally</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">taking air</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">and turning it into sugar and cellulose</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">energy from the sun like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">honest way to do it so autotrophic</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">self-feeding effectively versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">heterotrophic other feeding which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">what we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">yeah so basically no matter what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">animal you are you&#39;re stealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">those uh resources from some</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">animal or some plant and ultimately if</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">you chase things</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">these things down far enough it has to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">come from some autotroph almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">which are plants</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">which are generating these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">through photosynthesis so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">um do we still call it a transfer</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">frontier</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">if it&#39;s been going on for so long that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just the way things function</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s kind of a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">without a difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">but anyway uh is it a perfect match</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:48.799" style="s2">maybe not maybe uh maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">easier when you&#39;re talking about human</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">populations but it you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">back off the tolerances just slightly at</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">maps</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">very well yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna get through a few more</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">of these because we spent a long time on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">the four that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">weren&#39;t even from this last hour uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">hoping you can share some evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">thoughts on recreational substance use</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">are we faced with new stressors and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">lifestyles that are prompting new ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">to cope</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">or have we always looked for ways to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:20.560" style="s2">alter consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">uh yes the answer to both of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.560" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">um so in part uh create a world of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">stress from which you cannot escape and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">boredom also reigns uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">reigns supreme and you will not only</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">have uh people or rats where research</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">has been done</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">um seeking to press the lever for more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">cocaine or whatever it is over and over</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">again but they&#39;re more likely to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">addicted</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">when they&#39;re bored and uh that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">that is just now well understood</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">um put aside that addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">um you know abuse as opposed to use have</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">uh boy where is the question have we</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:34:59.440" style="s2">always looked for ways to alter</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">absolutely i believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a universal because</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">there&#39;s just a lot of little cultures</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have complete information</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">but this is one of the things that seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">close to a universal</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">in the human experience that there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">the seeking of some kind of altered</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">um from you know something as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">fermenting fruit</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">uh to bringing together a number of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">amazonian species</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">and making ayahuasca yep um yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">brain hack uh that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">do various things i would argue it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">allows you to to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">uh move across the standard lines of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">consciousness so that you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">investigating</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">your own um hidden cognition</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">but anyway people do it with all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">of stuff that isn&#39;t you know even</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">substance based sometimes like uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">sweat lodges for example yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">uh starvation and anyway there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">sorts of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">um so yes it&#39;s a it&#39;s a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">tradition in so many cultures</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">that you&#39;d have to be crazy to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">it was anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">adaptive which isn&#39;t to say that every</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">interaction is adaptive right</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">are there examples in biology of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">predators that hunt by disguising</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">themselves as prey</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">how effective are they compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">types of predators thank you for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">informative content</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">just let me say there&#39;s lots of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">lots of examples of prey disguising</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">itself as something that&#39;s toxic or</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">yeah episomatic prey but um there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">very handsome deep-sea</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">fish oh god that have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">yes like a little uh looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">invertebrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">on a fishing anglerfish anglerfish</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">hesitant to say anglerfish because i</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">know that anglerfish</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">is a term that applies to some amazonian</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">fish</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">is that oh those are archer fish maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">yeah i think those are archer fish</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">um that shoot insects off of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">i think this thing attached to the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right the deep-sea ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">are angler fish</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">um and uh anyway they&#39;re very they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">very interesting creatures yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">also they&#39;re actually so handsome they</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">are very lovely yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">no actually they are basically um</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.040" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">it is not true but it should be true</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">that they had to descend so deep in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">ocean that there was no sunlight on</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">account of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">just sheer ugliness there&#39;s a bat like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">this as i remember that has a it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">good that he has a flap but he pulls up</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">over his face</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">yeah yes i&#39;ll show a picture we will we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">will show that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">he&#39;s a very interesting fruit bath yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">but not pretty nope</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">not pretty um did we answer that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">oh yes yes we did oh how effective are</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">they compared to other types of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">predators</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t so the only example we came up</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">with anglerfish i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">in order to answer the question how</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">effective are they compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">types of predators you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">compare</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">control for both phylogeny and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know who the english fish</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">are related to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if they&#39;re deep sea and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">so it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">likely that such fish have gone into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">new place</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">impossible to answer the question while</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">controlling for the things you would</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">have to control for</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">answerable question yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">and i will say i&#39;m coming up with other</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">examples now like when i think about oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">there was this thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">i i tweeted about it some years back uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">a spider mimic at the tail on the tail</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">snake that causes birds to birds that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">eat spiders to come and then get eaten</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">by the snake</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">exactly um and then i had a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">oh there are some others kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">that i think snakes snakes may do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">with their tails</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not exactly uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">well they&#39;re disguising parts of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">themselves as prey yeah there is stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">that definitely yeah yeah yeah um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">then there&#39;s other stuff like um</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">you know looking blending in with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">flower which is kind of at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">right if you if you&#39;re a like a a mantid</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">disguised as a flower part and some</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">pollinator is going to come to pollinate</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">the flower it&#39;s not exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">talking about but it&#39;s really close</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">i mean camouflage is that&#39;s why i say</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s at the edge because</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">they&#39;re camouflaging themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">indicates food yeah so i think it counts</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">thematically but it&#39;s not a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">match</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">in gender ideology they say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">everyone has a gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">cis peoples matches their sex but they</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">can&#39;t explain what gender identity is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">can&#39;t measure it and it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2">material basis do you have thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">yeah gender ideology is uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">ideology that is a decent match for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:57.520" style="s2">lot of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">woke anti-analytical anti-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible to assess impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">falsify um</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">that said as i you know as we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">now many many times</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">here and elsewhere gender is real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">not a human construct it wasn&#39;t made up</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">by humans gender is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">the behavioral manifestation of sex and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">for some people looking around at what</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">way that members of their sex tend to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">behave they may say you know what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna prefer to behave like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">other sex or in stereotyped ways they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">more like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">the other sex behaves like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">fine you know behavior doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">material basis</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">but um you know not having a material</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">basis does not render it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">uh unfalsifiable or untestable or</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">unscientific</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the point where they wiggle out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">all attempts to figure out what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">that makes it unscientific there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">more but</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">i mean you know at some point we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">going to get down to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">can we just be decent to each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">right the idea that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">establish this category it&#39;s not on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:11.119" style="s2">basis of something scientific so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">going to assert that it is and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to bend the science to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">it seem scientific</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">look you know gender is interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">highly plastic it has certain consistent</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">features there do seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">some people who are um</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">out of phase with their uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">morphology such that trans is the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">category and that appears to be an</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">ancient phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">but not nearly at the level that we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">seeing it nor</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">does it suggest that surgery is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">proper response that you know so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">i think i think we just need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">decent to each other and uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">leave open the possibility that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">stuff we don&#39;t get but at some level</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot that we do get and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">it does not match the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">madness that we are seeing yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll do three more here and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">switch to the next</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">to today to this hour&#39;s livestream</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure what this next one means</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">next time you&#39;re on rogan can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">explain to him that 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">of mongolian men being direct mail-line</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">descendants of genghis khan</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">means that 100 percent are direct</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">descendants in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure why that is posited as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">as a truth i i think the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">is that if 10 to 20 percent of mongolian</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">are direct mail-line descendants</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">above some threshold then a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">percent of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">are likely to be descendants below some</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">threshold that the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">genes as this self-atomizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">property over time means</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">you have to set a threshold to establish</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">so the idea is that that 10 to 20 is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">what we can discern with our current</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">and because what we can discern with our</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">current tools</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">is uh is imprecise and we&#39;re going back</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">in history a long ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">right so if you set some threshold where</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">you say you need</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">uh x level of sequence identity right</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">in order to be able to say descendant</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">then well what</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">what percentage would you come up with</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">if you had half that level</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a point at which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">so low</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">that you can&#39;t establish it but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">mean you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">uh genghis khan somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">in by some ancestor i guess so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">so i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">however he&#39;s talking about men and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">and it feels it seems to me that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">trace the y chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">and um you know direct descendants of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">genghis khan</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">should all have his y chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">and that that shouldn&#39;t have slop in it</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">there will be uh some inaccuracy in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s not going to get less</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">concentrated over time it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">y chromosome and there&#39;s not a lot even</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">crossing over at that 23rd</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">uh 23rd spot</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">i am now afraid that i&#39;m about to make a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">serious error that i will be</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">correcting with great embarrassment in</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">the next live stream but it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">that a direct descendant of genghis khan</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">necessarily has to have his y chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">direct male descendant</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:38.319" style="s2">well direct male descendant does not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">oh okay so you don&#39;t we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">about a line of male male male male male</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">um his daughter could have had a son</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">there um that doesn&#39;t have his white</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">chromosome so i&#39;m not wrong no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">not you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not wrong um so yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">if i mean maybe maybe this recovers the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">question then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s not the 10 to 20 of mongolian</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">men being direct male line descendants</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">10 if if what is hidden in this question</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">is that 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">of mongolian men are understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">direct mail line descendants because</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">his y chromosome and therefore we know</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">atlantic article</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">anti-racist arguments are tearing people</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">apart maybe the author saw your latest</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">live stream</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">ha reassuring that the periodical isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">100 in on the candy kool-aid yeah oops</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">believe it or not had this open and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">thought we might get to it</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">in the first hour and didn&#39;t um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">so this is conor friedersdorf it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">too surprising that he ended up writing</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">this piece</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">but the fact that he&#39;s still published</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">in the atlantic is a good sign</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">there you go um according to the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">census</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">male atheists outnumber females female</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">atheists in a two to one proportion</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">why do you think it is this way please</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">uh i think this is going to have to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">with um this is going to be a similar</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">answer to why</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">women can form at higher rates uh when</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">put them through like the ash conformity</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">experiments and such</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">and that are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">appeasing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">and soothing over</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">disruption and discomfort on average</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">as a rule uh than men are and at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">and presumably forever atheism is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">a is a minority view it&#39;s a fringe view</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t offer the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">community or comfort that</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">religion does yeah are to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">slightly differently</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">um males are traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">more likely to uh blaze new</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">paths and the path out of an established</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">belief system</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">is likely to be pioneered by males more</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">frequently than females</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">expect that that pattern has to continue</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:35.200" style="s2">just that it has traditionally been male</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">associated</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.200" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">behaviors and that one of the things i</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">mean but but it&#39;s been male-associated</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">behaviors for the same reason that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">in every human culture that does whale</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">hunting</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">women don&#39;t do whale hunting right so i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">it is in part about um not being able</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">you know if in your prime you might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.599" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">or or breastfeeding um you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:01.599" style="s2">likely to be taking huge risks that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">would put not just you</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.599" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">but your tiny children at risk yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">i see some aspect of that because this</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">is completely a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">belief which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">atheism or atheism a simple belief it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">seems to me that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">this is probably not going to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">to people but</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">you could there is no bar</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">to writing new mental code that couples</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">atheism with exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">behaviors that would emerge from faith</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">or some particular faith there&#39;s no bar</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">you can write any code you want the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">software level</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">so what that means is if it is true</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">that the beliefs that are resident</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">inside these evolved</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">systems is resulting in behavior that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">females to carry out the part of their</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">role that would block them from taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">up whale hunting</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">that code could be generated and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">you can break the pattern um</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">that said well i guess the plea i would</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">make one more time</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">is we are at a place where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">renegotiate</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">the um relationship between males and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">females the ancestral stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and the no holds barred</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">everything is post-modern doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">so what we need to do is figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">to renegotiate this so that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">access to whatever it is they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">but nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">forced to take up stuff they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">to do because of some naive belief that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">we should all want the identical</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">i mean you and i have done this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">um and so i think it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">people just recognize that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">mechanism to do it and it will not be</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">that it can be a very positive thing but</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">it is not a simple matter of saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">anything that ever created a gender role</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">was oppressive and you can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t cheat you can&#39;t say i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">want any of the downside of this gender</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">role but i want all the upside</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">yeah neither neither neither sex is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">allowed to do that and um</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">what has been pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.559" style="s2">it is captured the third wave on later</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">feminism</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.559" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">uh is that it would appear to be too</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">often exactly that a desire to keep all</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">of the upside</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">uh that comes from being a sex that</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">warranted protection</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">and did not have to take the risks while</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">also claiming all of the upside</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">of the other sex you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">have it both ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">yeah yeah all right we are</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">oh scrolling could there be a role to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">play for an antifa version of titania</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">mcgrath</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">that&#39;s from the militant moderate</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">james lindsay thinks is too dangerous um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">look at this point we are on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">for the collapse of the basic</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">at some level i don&#39;t know what too</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">dangerous means</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s slated for destruction so</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">um could it make things worse um of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">a lot of that is always the risk with</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">uh that is novel but</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">at some level when you&#39;re headed for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">waterfall</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">right you got to figure out what your</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">best likelihood is of paddling out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">the current so that you don&#39;t go over it</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">well i guess the the way it could be too</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">dangerous more than what titanium</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">mcgrath is actually doing is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">titanium mcgrath</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">character uh is making outlandish claims</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">and you know calling for sort of social</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">cancellation yep right but antifa</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">actually regularly um calls for violence</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">and so what would a what would a</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">titanium mcgrath style</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">uh parody of antifa look like</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">if it was to be believed if it was to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">effective that didn&#39;t also sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">call for violence and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be potentially dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">that it might result in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">same yeah i get it um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">obviously it can&#39;t uh you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">as titanium mcgrath does it i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">you know the funny thing is i would have</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">to go back and look at what titania</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">mcgrath does</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">um because it seems to me that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">involves the same danger</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">but it is well done yeah in other words</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it haphazardly you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">do it in such a way that the parody is</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:59.040" style="s2">very very clear and i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">you do in a world</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.040" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">where you know well but uh so i can&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i can&#39;t remember the name of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">the british comic who is actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">titania mcgrath</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">um but he was doing her character for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">while without it being clear that it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">a character</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">and that was a large part of its</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">effectiveness and then he got outed by</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">someone on the woke side who thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">that would cancel</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">mcgrath and it didn&#39;t like the character</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">continues to be quite powerful although</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">i think the account was taken down</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">briefly on twitter recently</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not how i remember it it was he</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">was anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t known who titania mcgrath was</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">but it was a clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">parody from the beginning i think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">certainly it was clear to some of us</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">right well i guess i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">where it is then right</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">yeah um tim dillon did a great parody of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">antifa in the hamptons</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">okay that sounds it sounds hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">uh bandanas have been pooh-poohed by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">media recently as an effective mask</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">compared to other options</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">do we need to hang up our spurs</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s a good question i saw this the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">methodology</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">was atrocious which doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.240" style="s2">was wrong but my thought was first of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">i will make an argument for bandanas on</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">the basis</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:14.559" style="s2">that they solve one of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.559" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">in general cause which is because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">can&#39;t be integrated normally</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">into what you wear they are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">oppressive whereas</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">if i put on my bandana</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">and i go out into the world i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s there until i&#39;m suddenly about</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">to go in someplace that i need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">mask and it&#39;s already on me</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">so my thought was if bandanas are</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">actually less effective they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">ineffective but they were less effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">in the particular study you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">referencing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">then there&#39;s a question about what would</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">you have to make them out of or what</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">would you have to line them with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">that was no longer the case and really</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">we should be shooting just as people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">have produced lots of masks that have</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">humorous things on them or</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">designs that are nice or whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">should be making bandanas</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">that solve the problem by changing the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">pore size if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">issue and that retain the value of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">which is that you can just simply have</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">it on and not think about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">and go into the world and you know i</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">actually find</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">in at least two instances that the mask</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">has come in handy even in places</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">where i didn&#39;t need one the bandana or</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">basket the bandana yeah so i had this</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">i was riding down a bike path</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">uh in a forest around here and there</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">were bugs</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">um and i pulled up the mask and i could</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">breathe</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">over your helmet uh i wasn&#39;t wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:46.079" style="s2">full face helmet i was oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">um and then the other place was</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">leaf blowing i kicked up a ton of pollen</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">i was already wearing a dust mask so</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a question to be answered uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">to the extent that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">atrociously um arranged study</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">is actually indicating something real</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">which i&#39;m not convinced that it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">but if it is then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">what do you have to do to modify it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">because the design</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">beats the hell out of wearing a mask</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">over your ears and pulling it down under</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">your chin which looks ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t comfortable causes acne i hold it</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">in my hands when i&#39;m not wearing it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not a great solution it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">great solution so anyway i</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">difficult one yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">worries of the movies at this point</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">frankly because we&#39;ve been watching some</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">of their kids</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">yeah indeed brazil is a great</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">movie oh also the big short</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">orientation to the world the big short</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">a really um emotional movie</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">as yeah the renegades are fighting</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">the the mockery and the insistence of</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">bettors that they are uh seeing a mirage</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">yeah anyway those are both good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">actually i&#39;ll provide a show</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">um that we recently uh re-watched</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">maybe my favorite um which is peaky</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">blinders which is just</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">just extraordinarily well done yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">is a great show</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">apparently this next question is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">supposed to start with the words</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">that should make more sense oh yes that</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">will make it make more sense thank you</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:18.960" style="s2">zach</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">do primates perceive emotion better in</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.960" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">the left visual field right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">baboons hold opponents on their left</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">side do we tend to move anti-clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">enclosed spaces</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">for instance stores to be ready for</p>

<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">that is fascinating echo um</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know um</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">other primates is known um</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">i would be surprised if we had if if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">had shifted that from</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">um other primates to humans like what</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">would have explained us</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">flipping the directionality of um</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">emotion in terms of the lateralization</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">of brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">as i would think would be similar but of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">course there&#39;s emotional processing</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.640" end="00:59:09.559" style="s2">in both in both hemispheres um and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:12.480" style="s2">this question about moving</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.559" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">anti-clockwise and closed spaces stores</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">i&#39;d never thought of it but as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">read it i started imagining</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">i thought well they&#39;re they&#39;re all set</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">up that way isn&#39;t that just because like</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">we&#39;re just forced to do it but no</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re all set up that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">no they&#39;re not anticlockwise they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">clockwise but only when viewed from</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:32.559" style="s2">below</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">ah um</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.559" end="00:59:35.920" style="s2">yeah this is a tough one for one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:37.520" style="s2">think the real</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.920" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the answer to this question</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.520" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">but i do think the way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:46.319" style="s2">is if it were the case</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.119" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">that we reduce our vulnerability to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.319" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">enemies by keeping them on a predictable</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">side in which we better process their</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">intent or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">then there would be a premium on being</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.880" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work this way but worked the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">opposite way</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">which is i mean almost certainly you</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">know it&#39;s the adaptive explanation for</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">you know not just handedness but there</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">being a nine-to-one ratio</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:13.200" style="s2">of right-to-left-handers in every human</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">population right so that having</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">you know having the dominant way being</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">useful for sort of group cohesion and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:19.599" style="s2">problem solving but always having</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">someone in the group</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">um that is likely to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:24.559" style="s2">what about attacks from that side or</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">maybe i can lift i can get up into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">tree that way or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">well but the problem is that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">wondering</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">if the logic in this case so you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">if you take the example of the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">desirable object in the tree</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">that isn&#39;t accessible with the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">hand but is accessible with the left</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">hand so that the group gets or</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">the lineage gets accessed to it by</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">virtue of having</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">a lefty um and you don&#39;t need an even</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">number but in the case of this</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">antagonism idea i&#39;m wondering if it</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tend to a 50 50.</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">where to the extent that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">strong bias</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">towards one side the advantage to coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">from the other side</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:10.319" style="s2">is great until you get to 50 50. and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">i&#39;m doubtful about this in an</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.319" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">antagonistic context because i think you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">would get to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">a 50 50 parody or very close to it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">unless there was some other reason for</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">the lateralization</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">um so i&#39;m doubtful but i i wouldn&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">it out</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">what is your view on the impact on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">lack of techno-optimists</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">recently all mainstream technology and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">science themes have been overwhelmingly</p>

<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">do you understand i don&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:52.079" style="s2">the connection so i would i have</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:54.240" style="s2">i in the past have argued that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:55.839" style="s2">techno-optimism is part of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.240" end="01:01:58.319" style="s2">that we are facing that it&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.839" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">new cornucopianism that imagines</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">um that all we need is human ingenuity</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">to solve even problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">of clear resource depletion um</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.359" end="01:02:16.000" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">that fact um</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.000" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">it is true though that dystopian views</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">of the future</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">are much more common at least in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">my my sense of what kinds of stories are</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">are making sense right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">uh than than optimistic ones and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">want to use the word utopian because</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">less likely you know a dystopia is going</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">to be easy to fall into and a utopia</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">just won&#39;t happen so how about an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">optimistic version</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">i guess an optimistic version of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">future that doesn&#39;t put too much faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">technology and human ingenuity is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:54.319" style="s2">i&#39;d be looking for</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">so i think i think this question doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.319" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">insofar as i know exactly what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">asked doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t quite thread the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">needle</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">exactly the way that i would do so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">what i see going on is our system</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:13.599" style="s2">is so techno-optimist by</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:15.440" style="s2">structural design that the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.599" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">markets of our political</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.440" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">apparatus the corruption of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">political apparatus all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">tend towards techno-optimism right that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:25.520" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">um where we might have the precautionary</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.520" end="01:03:30.559" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">or the chesterton&#39;s fence recognition of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.559" end="01:03:34.799" style="s2">old protections and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">what we instead have</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.799" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">is this childlike faith that that which</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:40.960" style="s2">is new</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">is fine until we know better right at</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.960" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">which point it&#39;s too late to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">and so i guess the point is i think the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">dystopian nature of our fiction</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">is the natural outgrowth of a system</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">that is based on the faith of the safety</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">of the novel</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:04:01.839" style="s2">the novel is not safe and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">because we are on a uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">on a ship that is committed to the idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:10.839" style="s2">that it is safe until proven otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">we are headed to dystopia right we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.839" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">blindly headed into the north atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">in the winter</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:22.559" style="s2">at breakneck pace on the basis that most</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.200" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">patches of water are not uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.559" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">inhabited by an iceberg yeah right which</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">will result in you hitting an iceberg</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">soon enough okay we are going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">get through</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:39.839" style="s2">looks like six more uh very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">one of these is just a comment a google</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.839" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">search for brett weinstein listed you as</p>

<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">in two weeks we would love to hear your</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">thoughts on circumcision as we both have</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:16.880" style="s2">differing opinions and neither of us is</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">very staunch thanks</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.880" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">so you did this recently yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">answered this</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:23.119" style="s2">maybe two two episodes ago and i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">uh dave</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.119" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">our the guy who&#39;s making the clips for</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">us actually clipped it out so</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">we might just refer to that yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">short version is</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:37.520" style="s2">the foreskin and circumcision are both</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">adaptive that&#39;s the implication</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.520" end="01:06:42.160" style="s2">of the fact that the foreskin exists and</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">it is made of material and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.160" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">passes the adaptive test but the removal</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">of it also passes the adaptive test</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.039" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">so probably these are responses to two</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:54.079" style="s2">different selective forces that are in</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.079" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">the question is how does this map on to</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:01.280" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">in other words if for example the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.280" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">removal of the foreskin is</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.559" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">a uh a an issue of hygiene</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">and epidemiology as has sometimes been</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">implicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.680" end="01:07:16.960" style="s2">to very much um</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:18.079" style="s2">this has been controversial but</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.960" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">nonetheless if</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.079" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what the removal is about then it</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">is possible that modern</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">medicine or um the access to</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:30.799" style="s2">reliable um hygiene maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:32.319" style="s2">mechanisms like showers and things</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">means that that advantage no longer</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.319" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">applies don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re dealing with something</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">that existed for a purpose in the past</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">and it is unclear how it maps onto the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.280" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">that that probably means that you are</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">free to navigate this that you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">there&#39;s costs and benefits on both sides</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.160" style="s2">do what feels right i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.160" end="01:07:59.920" style="s2">mistake to be made and i will just say</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.839" end="01:08:02.720" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">lest people misunderstand as i suspect</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.720" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">people did when you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">circumcision a couple</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">weeks ago just because something has</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.400" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">persisted and been adapted for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">population does not mean that the rest</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:15.599" style="s2">of us need to look at</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">and applaud it or get behind it you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.599" end="01:08:18.640" style="s2">this is this</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">this is a long-standing argument in</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.640" end="01:08:23.759" style="s2">cultural anthropology right you go in</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">and simply observe even things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.759" end="01:08:26.960" style="s2">that you yourself find heinous if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">were trying to do ethnography</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.960" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">or are you allowed to speak what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">understand to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">a better a better way so</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:40.799" style="s2">for instance often</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">people who are simply critics of male</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.799" end="01:08:44.560" style="s2">circumcision will say</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">well if you are in favor of it you must</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.560" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">also be in favor of female genital</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">mutilation</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">and really uh there there is no good</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:54.719" style="s2">analogy between those</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">two things in part because although we</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.719" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">don&#39;t know as you have said brett</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">what the adaptive reasons for male</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">circumcision have been where they have</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">shown up multiple times in human history</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:07.679" style="s2">there has never been a suspicion or a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:09.920" style="s2">hypothesis that has gotten</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.679" end="01:09:10.799" style="s2">anywhere with evidence that it was about</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.920" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">controlling</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.799" end="01:09:16.239" style="s2">um reproduction of or you know otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:18.159" style="s2">controlling the demographic that is men</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.239" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">whereas female genital mutilation</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.159" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">clearly has been about controlling the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">and the demographic that is women and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">whenever you are controlling a</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">particular demographic</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:30.480" style="s2">uh with something that is widespread it</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">may well have been adapted but that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s any less</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">cruel unreasonable heartless and should</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">be abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">yeah um one final note i would just say</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:46.560" style="s2">there are many mechanisms whereby a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:48.960" style="s2">human mating system has been maintained</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">almost always the downsides of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.960" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">maintenance mechanisms fall</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">on women which is not fair um that said</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:59.360" style="s2">the west which basically abandons this</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:01.360" style="s2">invites a whole different level of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.360" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">catastrophe of a different sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.360" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">and so we need to discuss those things</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">in the context</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">of each other right right so it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">moment what it is is pick your failure</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:14.159" style="s2">and the real question is how can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:16.480" style="s2">avoid a failure mode and share the costs</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.159" end="01:10:17.520" style="s2">of whatever our system is equally that</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">would be the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.520" end="01:10:24.400" style="s2">yeah okay two more questions</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:26.320" style="s2">one of which is a double</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.400" end="01:10:28.239" style="s2">uh or actually it&#39;s just a two-part</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.320" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">thing first first of two</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.239" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">the death metric really bothers me i try</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">and explain it this way</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">hypothetically if the virus took 20</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:37.120" style="s2">years off the end of life</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:38.880" style="s2">old people would die middle-aged</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.120" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">unhealthy people would be at risk</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.880" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">young adults would be mostly fine kids</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:44.239" style="s2">would have almost no deaths</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:46.480" style="s2">do you still want your kid getting this</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.239" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">thoughts on the percentage graph to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.480" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">thoughts on the percentage graph do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">give long-term effects on heart</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">brain lungs reproduction so that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">of a comment than a question but i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:57.199" style="s2">it&#39;s a really apt</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:10:59.040" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking of it exactly right and</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.199" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">whether it really is that it knocks 20</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.040" end="01:11:02.080" style="s2">years off the end of life or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">probably more complicated than that but</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.080" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:05.840" style="s2">certainly how we should be thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.000" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">about it it&#39;s a good simple rubric and</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.840" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s before we even get to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:11.440" style="s2">question about whether</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">or not it may be in people who have</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">recovered</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">hiding out in neurological tissue to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">re-emerge</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:20.480" style="s2">later the way um uh herpes zoster which</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">is chickenpox</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.480" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">hides and then comes out and causes</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">shingles so</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">we&#39;re really early days here with</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:28.320" style="s2">respect to what the actual cost of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:29.920" style="s2">thing might be</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.320" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">yeah and the fact that it doesn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.920" end="01:11:34.320" style="s2">up in you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">immediate death is little comfort given</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.320" end="01:11:37.840" style="s2">how many systems it damages and how</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">severely it apparently does so</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.840" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">yeah okay last question for today</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">i was watching a documentary on tantra</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:49.280" style="s2">tantric sex with colombian girlfriend</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">many affluent white women gyrating and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.280" end="01:11:53.120" style="s2">moaning to connect with their sensuality</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">the girlfriend asks why don&#39;t they just</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.120" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">dance is dance adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">what are the effects of dance losing</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">popularity in the white west</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">this is a great question yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:03.440" style="s2">your colombian girlfriend asking why</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t they just dance</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.440" end="01:12:10.159" style="s2">that is apt that is that is terrific</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">yeah in fact uh for years now i&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.159" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:15.199" style="s2">to have a podcast discussion with iona</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.360" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">italia about this very</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">question about what is lost in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">tradition of partner dancing because</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:23.120" style="s2">even if you have dancing</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.000" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">so she does tango exactly exactly and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.120" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2">yes i think there are great many things</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">that are supposed to be worked out on a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:29.280" style="s2">dance floor that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">um get worked out in other much more</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.280" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.239" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">ways and we you know it&#39;s another one of</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">these things where</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:40.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh um</p>

<p begin="01:12:52.320" end="01:12:55.520" style="s2">from from stri from smithsonian tropical</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">research institute where you were</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">and you reported in fact you would i</p>

<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:10.480" style="s2">of art that you had that i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">of a couple dancing um either salsa or</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:24.000" style="s2">what you&#39;d seen in cartagena as well in</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.239" end="01:13:25.520" style="s2">panama too but i remember you talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.000" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">about cartagena it&#39;s just a place i</p>

<p begin="01:13:36.159" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">embrace</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.040" end="01:13:40.800" style="s2">both of whom were quite heavy set and</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">neither of whom were young</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.800" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">but both of whom were beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:47.440" style="s2">doing the dance well</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.239" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">and clearly engaging in sensuality and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.440" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">and frankly sexuality in a way that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">totally acceptable and lovely and loving</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">and wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">and that this was also something you</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">were seeing among people dancing</p>

<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:07.199" style="s2">in our podcast but</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.960" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole landscape that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.199" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">be sorted out here because</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that dance is sex it&#39;s not</p>
