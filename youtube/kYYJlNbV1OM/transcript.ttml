<p begin="00:00:15.140" end="00:00:20.660" style="s2">Well, you might as well start by writing down that URL. Well, you might as well start by writing down that URL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2"> Before get out of class ends, I will give you time again. I&#39;ll show it to you again at the end of class.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.820" end="00:00:26.740" style="s2"> That&#39;s where the syllabus is.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.680" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2"> The course summary basically contains The syllabus will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:32.080" style="s2"> Pretty much everything you need to know about the class.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.160" end="00:00:35.580" style="s2"> This course has a textbook The... there&#39;s a text.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.240" end="00:00:39.260" style="s2"> This is it. This is it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:42.820" style="s2"> It compiles key chapters in many books. It consists of readings from a larger text.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.120" end="00:00:46.940" style="s2"> Although this book is very old, but I use it because it&#39;s old, but</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.940" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2"> Because a lot of the theorists that we are going to talk about are also old...</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:57.640" style="s2"> So it is very suitable for reading materials...and so I found this particular text accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.380" end="00:01:04.220" style="s2"> And many of the people that we&#39;re going to talk about are very...</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.220" end="00:01:08.840" style="s2"> Have very sophisticated views of personality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:12.760" style="s2"> So if you don’t read some of the same advanced articles And I think that it does you a disservice</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.760" end="00:01:18.380" style="s2"> It may be difficult for you to understand the essence of it unless you read something that&#39;s sufficiently sophisticated.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:22.010" style="s2"> But if you read, at least you can So that you actually understand, at least to some degree,</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.010" end="00:01:26.740" style="s2"> Roughly understand their thinking what the people that we&#39;re going to study were talking about.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2"> We may also start from the definition of personality. We might as well start, I suppose, with a definition of personality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.660" end="00:01:39.700" style="s2"> But it&#39;s hard to define something that&#39;s that general because...</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:43.580" style="s2"> Because when you&#39;re speaking about human beings,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.580" end="00:01:46.250" style="s2"> It&#39;s not that simple to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.250" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2"> Distinguish personality from other what constitutes personality and what constitutes something else.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:57.340" style="s2"> So I will cut into the discussion from a few perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.340" end="00:02:00.430" style="s2"> At the same time and while I&#39;m doing so...</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.430" end="00:02:03.220" style="s2"> I would like you also to consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.220" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2"> The nature of what you&#39;re going to learn.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2"> Human personality is, essentially, unfathomable.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.780" end="00:02:17.150" style="s2"> Human beings are unbelievable complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.150" end="00:02:20.540" style="s2"> And the social environment we live in is equally complicated, and we&#39;re nested in systems that are also unbelievably complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.380" end="00:02:23.830" style="s2"> There are more patterns of connections in the human brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.830" end="00:02:26.200" style="s2"> The number of neural connection patterns between neurons in your brain than there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.200" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2"> There are subatomic particles in the universe. There are more subatomic particles in the universe.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:30.020" style="s2"> Much more by a substantial margin.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2"> You can look up Gerald Edelman if you want to find out about that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.860" end="00:02:39.930" style="s2"> So it&#39;s reasonable to say And so it&#39;s not unreasonable to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.930" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2"> You&#39;re the most complicated thing we know of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2"> It&#39;s much more complicated by many orders of magnitude.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2"> And the probability that you can understand yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:55.270" style="s2"> Or the probability of having any overall cognition is very low and anything approaching totality is extraordinarily low.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:00.280" style="s2"> So this makes the study of personality something</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:07.600" style="s2"> It is daring and hopeless and complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.880" style="s2"> We will discuss a lot of theorists Now, we&#39;re going to cycle through a very large number of theorists...</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2"> You will find...and what you&#39;ll find is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2"> Although there are commonalities between them,</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2"> Their theories are still very different, there are marked differences.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:22.160" style="s2"> You might think And so then you might ask yourself...</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.080" end="00:03:23.740" style="s2"> Uh Well...</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.580" end="00:03:27.400" style="s2"> If these theorists hold their own words What&#39;s the point of studying...</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:30.860" style="s2"> Then learn these theories one by one...this sequence of theorists and ideas if...</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.860" end="00:03:33.860" style="s2"> What&#39;s the point...there&#39;s no point of agreement between them?</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2"> My answer is And I would say first:</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:39.240" style="s2"> First of all, they still have points of agreement between them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.860" end="00:03:40.740" style="s2"> Although...</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.520" end="00:03:43.450" style="s2"> Personality hasn&#39;t advanced to the point,</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.450" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2"> There is no one yet where I would say that we have a...</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:49.540" style="s2"> Undisputed unified theory...homogeneous theory that&#39;s free of internal contradictions.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:53.060" style="s2"> But I would also say that...</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:03:58.360" style="s2"> Personality is a multi-field discipline...personality is a hybrid discipline.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.100" end="00:04:01.780" style="s2"> It&#39;s partly science...</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:04.800" style="s2"> It&#39;s also about engineering...but it&#39;s partly engineering.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.280" end="00:04:09.640" style="s2"> From a clinical point of view, I think personality science is more like engineering. The clinical element of it, I would say, is more like engineering,</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.640" end="00:04:12.140" style="s2"> And the job of an engineer is to construct things and what engineers do is try to do things.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:14.140" style="s2"> They follow the theory They try to make something happen.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.350" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2"> Put ideas into action and they are informed by theory.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.450" end="00:04:19.790" style="s2"> But the point is still to build something.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.770" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2"> And when you&#39;re working as a clinical psychologist,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2"> 1/3 to 1/2 and most of the initial theorists that we&#39;ll discuss, for the first...</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.100" style="s2"> All belong to clinical theorists... little more than a third to a half of the course, are clinical theorists.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2"> They&#39;re trying to build something.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2"> But they&#39;re dealing with very very difficult...</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2"> Conceptual problems, because...conceptual problems, because...</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2"> They are trying to cure mental disorders...they&#39;re either trying to cure mental disorders</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:46.840" style="s2"> Or maybe even unhappiness...</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:49.000" style="s2"> Also trying to regain health for patients...and trying to bring about health...</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2"> But the problem with that is that...</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:04:54.890" style="s2"> From a scientific point of view, it&#39;s not a straightforward thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.890" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2"> We can&#39;t exactly define mental illness to define a mental disorder from a scientific perspective...</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:03.640" style="s2"> Because of mental health...because what&#39;s healthy, mentally, and what&#39;s not...</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.640" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2"> One part is social judgment...is partly social judgment.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:10.340" style="s2"> One part is socially constructed...and it&#39;s partly socially constructed.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.440" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2"> And it partly has to do with norms...</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2"> One part has to do with ideals...and it partly has to do with ideals,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2"> As you might say because you might also say that...</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:20.580" style="s2"> A healthy state is a normal state...to be healthy is to be normal.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.640" end="00:05:23.880" style="s2"> You might also say that health is an ideal state. But you could also say that to be healthy is to be ideal.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.100" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2"> And then, of course, you run into the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2"> You need to conceptualize what an ideal state is of having to conceptualize an ideal.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.140" end="00:05:32.510" style="s2"> But actually And it isn&#39;t self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.510" end="00:05:37.860" style="s2"> Science cannot form the concept of&#39;ideal&#39; well that science is capable of conceptualizing an ideal...</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.860" end="00:05:42.110" style="s2"> Because ideals belong to the field of moral judgments... because ideals tend to fall into the domain of moral judgments,</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.110" end="00:05:48.640" style="s2"> Or philosophical judgments rather than scientific judgments say, or philosophical judgments rather than scientific judgments per se.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:53.420" style="s2"> So what I would say to you is that...</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:05:59.040" style="s2"> It would be worthwhile to approach this course</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.040" end="00:06:02.460" style="s2"> Please imagine yourself as an engineer of the human spirit as if you were an engineer of the human spirit.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.780" end="00:06:07.100" style="s2"> An engineer of your own spirit, to begin with...</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.100" end="00:06:11.760" style="s2"> When you start communicating with others...but also an engineer of the spirits of other people...</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.680" end="00:06:14.930" style="s2"> You will also be the engineer of the soul of others...because, as you interact with other people...</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.720" end="00:06:20.900" style="s2"> Because inevitably you tell them what you want and what you don&#39;t want...you inevitably tell them what you want and what you don&#39;t want.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:25.920" style="s2"> When they give you what you want and what you admire...</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.920" end="00:06:27.990" style="s2"> You respond positively to them,</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.990" end="00:06:31.820" style="s2"> You pay attention to them, you smile at them, you focus...</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.820" end="00:06:35.380" style="s2"> You focus your thoughts on them, you interact with them.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.580" end="00:06:37.420" style="s2"> You will also because of their behavior, And you reward them...</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.420" end="00:06:40.040" style="s2"> And give them rewards...for acting in a particular manner,</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.040" end="00:06:43.040" style="s2"> And when they don&#39;t respond the way that you want,</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.040" end="00:06:44.710" style="s2"> Then you punish them...</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.710" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2"> You will show an unhappy expression, alienate this person or reject their friendship...with a look or by turning away or by rejecting their friendship or,</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:50.340" style="s2"> If you were a child, you would refuse to play with them when you&#39;re a child, by refusing to play with them.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:06:54.780" style="s2"> That&#39;s why And so...</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:01.880" style="s2"> We&#39;re engaged in the co-creation of personalities, our own and others...</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.880" end="00:07:07.160" style="s2"> This brings us back to the previous question...and that also brings up the same question:</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.160" end="00:07:15.100" style="s2"> What is it that we are all collectively trying to be and trying to create?</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:23.020" style="s2"> I believe that you all have realized your shortcomings in front of your ideals. I suspect that you all have the experience of falling short of the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.020" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2"> Whether this ideal is proposed by you or by others...an ideal that you hold for yourself or an ideal that other people hold for you.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.360" end="00:07:30.260" style="s2"> I believe that you all</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.680" style="s2"> I have felt the negative consequences of falling short of that ideal.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.600" end="00:07:38.140" style="s2"> Freud’s theory is that Freud would conceptualize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.180" end="00:07:44.150" style="s2"> When the super-ego imposing its judgment on ego,</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.150" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2"> You being the ego,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:50.940" style="s2"> The super-ego being... a hybrid, I suppose, of...</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.450" end="00:07:54.450" style="s2"> Are external factors...external forces</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.450" end="00:08:01.540" style="s2"> And your internalization of those judgments and forces.</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.060" end="00:08:10.660" style="s2"> For the personality itself I think Now, personality per se, I would say...</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.660" end="00:08:14.480" style="s2"> It has these ideal elements...has these elements of ideal...</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.480" end="00:08:17.100" style="s2"> There are structural elements...and has structural elements as well,</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.100" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2"> In the second half of the course we will discuss these more and we&#39;re going to talk about those more in the second half of the class.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.980" end="00:08:26.820" style="s2"> The structural elements can be lined up and outlined more scientifically.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:32.990" style="s2"> The second half of the class concentrates more on physiology</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.990" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2"> Brain physiology—brain physiology</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2"> And on statistical approaches to the description of personality.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2"> You might think that what I just mentioned is the approximate course category Um... I suppose you might say that that outlines the territory.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.460" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2"> The full name of this course is &quot;Personality and Its Transformations&quot; because The course is called Personality and Its Transformations, because...</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2"> We have personalities—that&#39;s who you are now</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:58.980" style="s2"> But our personalities are also capable of transformation, of change.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:02.960" style="s2"> Obviously we understand transformation as the result of learning. I mean, obviously we think about that as learning.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:08.360" style="s2"> It can be the learning of factual knowledge Um... some of that might be regarded as factual learning...</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.360" end="00:09:11.480" style="s2"> It can also be and some of it might be regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.480" end="00:09:14.740" style="s2"> Learning how to perceive and behave.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.500" end="00:09:16.950" style="s2"> At the beginning of the course we will And I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.950" end="00:09:23.620" style="s2"> The clinical psychologists that we&#39;ll cover, to begin with,</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.620" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2"> More concerned...are much more concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:31.940" style="s2"> The nature of the implicit structures that shape your perceptions,</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.940" end="00:09:37.880" style="s2"> The essence of those invisible structures...and also the implicit structures that shape your behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.880" end="00:09:41.260" style="s2"> And how they&#39;re integrated in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.260" end="00:09:45.350" style="s2"> To your negative emotion health and well-being,</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.640" end="00:09:51.180" style="s2"> Relatively the scholars we will meet in the second half...whereas the thinkers in the second half are more concerned about...</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.180" end="00:09:54.110" style="s2"> Will directly list those structural elements...laying out the structural elements of those features</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.110" end="00:09:59.540" style="s2"> And relate them to underlying, say, mechanistic phenomena,</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.540" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2"> They will assume...making the assumption, which seems warranted,</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.740" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2"> Your personality and the mode of operation of your brain that there&#39;s some relationship between your personality</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:08.710" style="s2"> Closely related and the manner in which your brain functions.</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.860" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to try to provide you with a meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.840" end="00:10:18.760" style="s2"> That will help you to unite these different theories.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.430" style="s2"> I&#39;ve often found it useful when I&#39;m trying to remember something</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.430" end="00:10:25.700" style="s2"> Use stories to connect facts to have a story to hang the facts on,</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.700" end="00:10:26.980" style="s2"> Otherwise you can only...otherwise you&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.980" end="00:10:29.650" style="s2"> Memorize the necessity of doing nothing but memorization, and...</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.650" end="00:10:31.480" style="s2"> And I think...it isn&#39;t obvious to me that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" end="00:10:33.940" style="s2"> Memorization does not allow you to acquire real knowledge. memory actually constitutes knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2"> Um...</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:37.030" style="s2"> What constitutes knowledge is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.030" end="00:10:42.500" style="s2"> Generation of a cognitive structure that enables you to...</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.500" end="00:10:46.360" style="s2"> To help you live a better life...conduct yourself more appropriately in life.</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:50.400" style="s2"> In other words, a course in psychology And so I suppose you might say that a course in psychology—</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:54.740" style="s2"> You could argue that a course in psychology, especially in personality,</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.740" end="00:10:57.540" style="s2"> Is a course in applied wisdom as well,</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.540" end="00:11:00.220" style="s2"> If wisdom is to a certain extent...assuming that wisdom is, in part,</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.220" end="00:11:04.760" style="s2"> Is to understand yourselves, so that you don&#39;t—</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.760" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2"> You can reduce it a bit—so that you don&#39;t present</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:09.820" style="s2"> Too much of an intolerable mystery to yourself,</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.820" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2"> You can also understand others better...and also to understand others so that you can...</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2"> To predict their behavior...predict their behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.520" end="00:11:18.980" style="s2"> And understand their motivations...understand their motivations,</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.980" end="00:11:20.820" style="s2"> Negotiate with them...negotiate with them,</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.820" end="00:11:22.820" style="s2"> Listen to them,</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.820" end="00:11:26.380" style="s2"> Cooperate with them...and formulate joint games with them,</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.380" end="00:11:29.750" style="s2"> From this you can better...so that you can integrate yourself reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.750" end="00:11:36.040" style="s2"> Integrate into the lives of others into the family and society with another person and with a family and in society.</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.140" end="00:11:42.550" style="s2"> The structural elements of personality might be regarded as Well, the structural elements of personality might be regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.640" end="00:11:48.040" style="s2"> The implicit structures that govern your perception, the implicit structures that govern your perception,</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.040" end="00:11:51.460" style="s2"> Implicit structure...and that tilt you towards certain kinds of behaviors.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.460" end="00:11:53.310" style="s2"> I can give you some examples</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:11:56.820" style="s2"> We can talk about the big five model just briefly.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.260" end="00:12:01.070" style="s2"> The big five personality model is a statistical model,</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.070" end="00:12:04.080" style="s2"> In the second half of the course which we&#39;ll cover in detail, trait by trait,</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.220" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2"> We will explain each personality trait in detail...partly during the second half of the course.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.340" style="s2"> The way that the big five was generated was that...</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.340" end="00:12:15.700" style="s2"> It was proposed about fifty years ago...its trait been generated over about fifty years...</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.700" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2"> Personality psychologists are first...that personality psychologists gathered together adjectives</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.300" end="00:12:22.260" style="s2"> I tried my best to collect within the English language first that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.260" end="00:12:25.720" style="s2"> All the words describing people in English were used to describe human beings,</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.720" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2"> How many are collected...as many adjectives that they could collect,</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:32.430" style="s2"> Then factor them...and then subjected them to a process called factor analysis,</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.430" end="00:12:35.900" style="s2"> In short, factor analysis is to determine by statistical methods...and what factor analysis does is enable you statistically to determine...</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.900" end="00:12:37.080" style="s2"> Similarity between different adjectives...in some sense how similar adjectives are to one another.</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.080" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2"> For example, So, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.540" end="00:12:47.990" style="s2"> If you gave a thousand people a list of adjectives</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.990" end="00:12:49.330" style="s2"> Let them describe themselves to describe themselves with,</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.330" end="00:12:51.410" style="s2"> One of the adjectives is happy...and one of the adjectives was happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.410" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2"> Another of the adjectives was social,</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:58.710" style="s2"> You will find those who think they are happier...you&#39;d find that those who rated themselves high on happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.710" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2"> Would also rate themselves high on social,</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:03.550" style="s2"> And those who think they are less happy...and those who rated themselves low on happy</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.550" end="00:13:06.380" style="s2"> Would also rate themselves low on social.</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.820" style="s2"> And by looking at those patterns of co-variation, you can determine...</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.820" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2"> What are the basic dimensions of personality...what the essential dimensions are of human personality.</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.100" end="00:13:19.020" style="s2"> One of the dimensions is roughly happiness.</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.020" end="00:13:20.420" style="s2"> That&#39;s extraversion.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.900" style="s2"> Another dimension is neuroticism. It&#39;s a negative emotion dimension. It&#39;s a negative emotion dimension.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.180" end="00:13:29.660" style="s2"> So, if you ask someone if they&#39;re anxious,</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.660" end="00:13:33.080" style="s2"> They score high on a scale of 1 to 7, and they score high, say, on a scale of one to seven,</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.080" end="00:13:35.960" style="s2"> Then their another scale number is likely to show.. they&#39;re also likely to score high on another item</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.960" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2"> They are sad that says that they&#39;re sad.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:41.840" style="s2"> In fact, bad emotions clump together. And it turns out that negative emotions clump together.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.020" end="00:13:45.550" style="s2"> And so that people who experience more of one negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.550" end="00:13:48.840" style="s2"> There will be a higher tendency to have all bad emotions have a propensity to experience more of all of them.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2"> There&#39;s another dimension called agreeableness.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:13:56.230" style="s2"> And agreeable people are self-sacrificing,</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2"> Compassionate, and polite.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.420" end="00:14:01.230" style="s2"> If you&#39;re dealing with an agreeable person</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.230" end="00:14:05.260" style="s2"> Then they don&#39;t like conflict, they care for other people.</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.800" end="00:14:08.360" style="s2"> Um, if you&#39;re dealing with an agreeable person,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.200" end="00:14:12.300" style="s2"> They tend to put your needs ahead of their own needs, they&#39;re likely to put your concerns ahead of theirs,</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.300" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2"> They don&#39;t like competition and have a cooperative spirit...they&#39;re non-competitive and cooperative.</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.460" end="00:14:18.080" style="s2"> Uh, it&#39;s a dimension where women are—</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.080" end="00:14:22.500" style="s2"> Women score more highly than men on agreeableness across cultures,</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.500" end="00:14:26.840" style="s2"> Even in terms of equality...including those cultures where the largest steps have been taken</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.840" end="00:14:30.010" style="s2"> The very progressive social environment is the same, towards producing an egalitarian social circumstance,</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.010" end="00:14:31.480" style="s2"> Like Northwestern Europe...like Scandinavia actually.</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.720" end="00:14:33.720" style="s2"> The gender differences in personality there</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.720" end="00:14:35.660" style="s2"> Bigger than other places are larger there than they are anywhere else.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.260" end="00:14:36.940" style="s2"> Um...</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.480" end="00:14:40.080" style="s2"> Another dimension is conscientiousness. Another trait is conscientiousness.</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:43.840" style="s2"> Conscientiousness is an excellent trait if you want to do well in...</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.840" end="00:14:46.070" style="s2"> Strong work especially...in school, and in work,</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.070" end="00:14:48.300" style="s2"> Especially if you&#39;re a manager or an administrator.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.320" end="00:14:51.160" style="s2"> I can&#39;t say we understand a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.160" end="00:14:52.940" style="s2"> Very comprehensive but about conscientiousness, although it...</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.940" end="00:14:55.910" style="s2"> No matter in which country the adjective molecular analysis is performed...it reliably emerges from factor analytic studies of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.910" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2"> It will continue to appear adjective groups across different countries.</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.370" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2"> Conscientious people are diligent, industrious, and orderly.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.380" end="00:15:05.860" style="s2"> By the way, their orderliness will shift their political views to the right. The orderliness tilts them towards political conservatism, by the way,</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.860" end="00:15:08.840" style="s2"> Because of your natural temperament... because it turns out that your in-built temperament,</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.840" end="00:15:10.130" style="s2"> And your in-built personality,</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.130" end="00:15:14.620" style="s2"> Will automatically filter the world you see... which constitutes a set of filters through which you view the world...</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.620" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2"> Will also adjust the way you process information... also alters the manner in which you process information,</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:21.780" style="s2"> This affects your thinking when you vote...and influences the way that you vote.</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.780" end="00:15:24.820" style="s2"> And so you might say, and I do believe that this is true,</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.820" end="00:15:27.780" style="s2"> Because over the years we have done a lot of related research...our—we&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on this as of late:</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.600" end="00:15:34.070" style="s2"> That is, the more accurate a measure you take of someone&#39;s political beliefs,</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.070" end="00:15:37.660" style="s2"> The more you find that personality is what&#39;s predicting them.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.760" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2"> And I agree with this point of view because you think about it, and I think that&#39;s a reasonable thing to think about, because, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:45.750" style="s2"> You have to—you have to figure out ways of simplifying the world,</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:47.580" style="s2"> After all, one person can&#39;t do everything right, because you just can&#39;t do everything.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.980" end="00:15:49.880" style="s2"> And so, people are specialized.</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.880" end="00:15:52.300" style="s2"> Everyone has their own domain. They have specialized niches that they occupy.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.300" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2"> You could think about them as social niches.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2"> A niche is a place where your particular skills in that small social field</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:15:58.760" style="s2"> Your skill will keep you alive, would serve to maintain you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.760" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2"> If you are very outgoing, you will actively look for a social niche. And so if you&#39;re extraverted, you&#39;re going to look for a social niche,</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:04.580" style="s2"> Because you like to be around people...because you like to be around people.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.580" end="00:16:05.690" style="s2"> And if you&#39;re introverted,</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.690" end="00:16:07.580" style="s2"> You&#39;re going to spend much more time on your own.</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.580" end="00:16:09.880" style="s2"> For example, an introverted person, and so, if you&#39;re an introverted person, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.880" end="00:16:13.780" style="s2"> You&#39;re gonna want a job where you&#39;re not selling,</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.780" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2"> Because you don&#39;t want to be in the crowd...and where you&#39;re not surrounded by groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.780" end="00:16:17.420" style="s2"> Catering to those who need you to use social etiquette who are making social demands on you all the time,</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.420" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2"> Because it will wear you out.</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.060" end="00:16:22.260" style="s2"> And if you are very extroverted, that&#39;s exactly what you want. Whereas if you&#39;re extraverted, that&#39;s just exactly what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.700" end="00:16:26.680" style="s2"> In the eyes of extroverts, the world is full of social opportunities. And so the extravert sees the world as a place of social opportunity.</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:29.550" style="s2"> And for the introvert, they just want to and the introvert sees the world as a place to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.550" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2"> Retreat from and spend time alone.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.300" end="00:16:37.240" style="s2"> These two lifestyles are reasonable and it turns out that both of those modes of being are valid,</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.240" end="00:16:38.970" style="s2"> The problem is...that the issue, at least to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:41.460" style="s2"> Is whether or not you&#39;re fortunate enough...</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.460" end="00:16:44.980" style="s2"> To match your temperament with the demands of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.980" end="00:16:48.730" style="s2"> And I suppose also whether you&#39;re fortune enough—fortunate enough—</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.730" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2"> So that you&#39;re born in an era</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.610" style="s2"> This era has an exclusive field where you can be useful where there is actually a niche for your particular temperament.</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.610" end="00:16:57.070" style="s2"> Not everyone is so lucky because it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that that will be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.070" end="00:17:00.910" style="s2"> Imagine that all of these temperamental dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.910" end="00:17:03.900" style="s2"> Will change because of evolutionary pressure, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:07.140" style="s2"> The degree of extroversion of different people forms a normal distribution. So there&#39;s a distribution of extraversion, a normal distribution.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.140" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2"> Most people are somewhere in the middle and then as you go out</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:12.580" style="s2"> The fewer people are distributed, the extremes there are fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.070" end="00:17:18.550" style="s2"> That is to say in a very wide time range And what that means is that, on average across large spans of time,</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.560" end="00:17:20.100" style="s2"> Every position on that distribution...there have been environments that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.100" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2"> The corresponding environment has appeared match every single position on that distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:26.350" style="s2"> But most of the environments are still close to the middle position.. with most of the environments matching the center,</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.350" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2"> Otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have evolved that way.</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:32.570" style="s2"> So sometimes being really extraverted is going to work well for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.570" end="00:17:35.240" style="s2"> In a minority of environments—a minority of niches,</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.240" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2"> But sometimes this personality can be a disaster...and sometimes it&#39;s just going to be a catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.800" end="00:17:42.040" style="s2"> For example, if you were born in a tyrannical society, I suspect, for example, that if you live in a tyrannical society,</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.040" end="00:17:44.750" style="s2"> Where any sign of...</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:46.830" style="s2"> Performance...of... of... of...</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.830" end="00:17:50.980" style="s2"> The signs that you are inclined to personal activities may bring you trouble...personally oriented activities likely to get you in trouble,</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.980" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2"> Extroverted and neurotic...that being extraverted and low in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2"> It might not be very beneficial because wouldn&#39;t be a very good idea, because...</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:17:59.140" style="s2"> You will love to talk about it and be lively...you&#39;re going to be mouthy and happy and saying a lot of things,</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.140" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2"> Unable to keep your thoughts to yourself,</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:02.740" style="s2"> You will also be relatively fearless...and you&#39;re going to be relatively fearless.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.940" end="00:18:04.310" style="s2"> Now, I don&#39;t know that for sure,</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.310" end="00:18:06.230" style="s2"> Because we haven&#39;t done the studies that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.230" end="00:18:10.380" style="s2"> To accurately match temperamental proclivity to environmental demand,</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.380" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2"> But you should understand what I mean...but you get what I mean.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.660" end="00:18:13.480" style="s2"> So...</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:16.570" style="s2"> Conscientious people, anyways—</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.570" end="00:18:20.280" style="s2"> Conscientious people are industrious and orderly.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.280" end="00:18:22.260" style="s2"> We know a little bit about orderliness.</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2"> Although it sounds strange, it seems to be associated, strangely enough, with disgust sensitivity,</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:29.000" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not that surprising...which I suppose isn&#39;t that surprising, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.000" end="00:18:32.680" style="s2"> You take an orderly person, and you put them in a messy kitchen,</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.680" end="00:18:34.920" style="s2"> They will definitely feel disgusted...they respond with disgust</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.920" end="00:18:37.050" style="s2"> I just want to hurry up and want nothing more than to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.050" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2"> Straighten it all out and organize it and clean it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2"> There are many types of orderliness, and there&#39;s tremendous variability in orderliness.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:42.840" style="s2"> Um...</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.800" end="00:18:46.440" style="s2"> I said before that orderliness predicts political conservatism and as I said, orderliness predicts political conservatism.</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.440" end="00:18:49.080" style="s2"> It&#39;s not the only thing, but it&#39;s certainly one of the things.</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.740" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2"> Um...</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:58.060" style="s2"> The correlation between conscientiousness and grades is about 0.4.</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.420" end="00:19:00.680" style="s2"> That&#39;s about sixteen percent of the variance.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.860" end="00:19:05.140" style="s2"> It&#39;s the second best predictor of university grades after intelligence, it&#39;s the second best predictor of university grades after intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.140" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2"> In this course, we will also discuss IQ... and we&#39;ll talk about intelligence during this course, too.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.200" end="00:19:11.060" style="s2"> Relatively speaking, IQ is a relatively straightforward concept. Intelligence is actually a relatively straightforward concept.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.680" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get into it today, but...</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:16.460" style="s2"> Conscientious people—they&#39;re industriousness—they&#39;re industriousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.460" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2"> Being organized will make them plan their time well, and their orderliness makes them schedule their time,</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:20.980" style="s2"> So they make efficient use of their time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.980" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2"> They use schedules and that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.000" end="00:19:25.680" style="s2"> We haven&#39;t been able to figure out anything about</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.680" end="00:19:28.740" style="s2"> The underlying biology or psychology of industriousness.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.040" end="00:19:33.140" style="s2"> We&#39;ve tried, really, dozens and dozens of tests,</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.140" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2"> Trying to find a laboratory measure on which a diligent person will have excellent performance...attempting to find a laboratory measure on which</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2"> But we failed completely. Industrial people do better, and we failed completely.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:42.460" style="s2"> And there&#39;s no animal models of industriousness, either.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:44.820" style="s2"> And so, I would say it&#39;s a great mystery that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.820" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2"> An unsolved mystery remains at the heart of trait psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.420" end="00:19:47.980" style="s2"> Um...</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a human-specific category, you know, I mean,</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.600" style="s2"> Maybe you would say that sled dogs are diligent...you could think of sled dogs maybe of being industrious, and maybe—</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.600" end="00:19:57.250" style="s2"> Or maybe sheep dogs and animals that work like that,</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.250" end="00:19:59.880" style="s2"> But after all they have undergone human training but of course they&#39;ve been trained by human beings, so...</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.880" end="00:20:04.740" style="s2"> And the diligence of animals is not the same as that of humans...but, it isn&#39;t obvious that animals are industrious the same way we are.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.940" end="00:20:09.310" style="s2"> I mean, industriousness involves sacrificing the present for the future.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.310" end="00:20:10.930" style="s2"> Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.930" end="00:20:13.100" style="s2"> This also means you have to be able to and it seems like you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.100" end="00:20:16.900" style="s2"> The ability to understand the concept of time can conceptualize time in order to sacrifice the present for the future.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:22.200" style="s2"> Speaking of diligence, I would recommend you One of the things that I would recommend that you do as students,</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.200" end="00:20:23.820" style="s2"> As a student of this course, in this course,</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.820" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2"> But this applies to every course... and maybe in every course, speaking of industriousness, is:</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.240" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2"> Come up with a plan of attack for the course,</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2"> And use a scheduler, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.740" end="00:20:35.330" style="s2"> If you treat your university career like a full-time job,</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.330" end="00:20:38.380" style="s2"> You&#39;re much more likely to succeed, and,</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.380" end="00:20:40.170" style="s2"> If you keep up on the readings,</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.170" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2"> Keep writing essays and all other exercises and you keep up on the essays and all of that,</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:48.300" style="s2"> Then you will not fall into the course progress...then you&#39;re much less likely as well to fall into despair</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.300" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2"> I won&#39;t feel too desperate when you get too far behind...</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:52.430" style="s2"> Using a Google Calendar or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.430" end="00:20:55.780" style="s2"> To organize a schedule for the entire semester...</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.780" end="00:20:58.860" style="s2"> This move at the beginning of the semester will benefit you a lot...at the beginning of the semester can be invaluable,</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.860" end="00:21:02.420" style="s2"> Especially if you&#39;re not very industrious,</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.420" end="00:21:04.110" style="s2"> Because it can keep you on track,</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.110" end="00:21:06.360" style="s2"> And one of the things we know about industrious people is...and one of the things we know about industrious people</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:08.780" style="s2"> Is that they are very good at using schedules,</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.780" end="00:21:11.680" style="s2"> And at planning the use of their time,</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.680" end="00:21:15.080" style="s2"> Of course I hope you all become smarter...and so, I would like to say that you should all be smarter,</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.080" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2"> But I don&#39;t know how you could be smarter.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know anything about how to improve intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:22.300" style="s2"> For improving diligence...and, I suppose we don&#39;t really know anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.300" end="00:21:24.260" style="s2"> We also know nothing about how to improve industriousness, either,</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.260" end="00:21:27.050" style="s2"> But I can tell you that people who are industrious</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.050" end="00:21:29.340" style="s2"> Come up with a strategy for problems that will be encountered in the future...</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.340" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2"> Actively develop strategies...for solving the problem that&#39;s ahead of them,</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:34.380" style="s2"> And do their best to stick to the strategy, and then they do whatever they can to stick to the strategy,</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.380" end="00:21:36.730" style="s2"> So if today or tomorrow...and so, for example, if you sat down,</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.730" end="00:21:39.940" style="s2"> You spend a few hours sitting down today or tomorrow, for a couple of hours—</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.940" end="00:21:43.110" style="s2"> Use Google Calendar or other...three hours—and you filled in a Google Calendar</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.110" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2"> The schedule tool you use—whatever you happen to use—</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:46.530" style="s2"> Develop a learning strategy with a strategy for studying,</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.530" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2"> Mark the due dates for all your assignments and exams and a list of when all your assignments are due and all of that,</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:52.910" style="s2"> And the study time you plan for them...and when you&#39;re going to sit down and study</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.910" end="00:21:56.250" style="s2"> Then you won&#39;t be in the position where you have to crammed for</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.250" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2"> Ten hours a day, hopelessly, right before</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2"> Embracing the Buddha&#39;s feet in despair...you know, important exam</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.090" end="00:22:04.200" style="s2"> And holding the Buddha&#39;s feet is a very inefficient learning method...it&#39;s also very ineffective way of studying by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.200" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2"> I mean, first of all people who cram for ten hours</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:10.500" style="s2"> Although they claim that they have been studying crazy for 10 hours, they are not really continuing to study say they&#39;re studying for ten hours, but they rarely are because, well...</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.260" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2"> I can&#39;t study for ten hours</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:15.850" style="s2"> I don&#39;t have the power of concentration that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.850" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2"> High concentration of attention for so long would enable me to do that for that prolonged period of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.360" style="s2"> I can manage about three hours of intense intellectual activity</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.360" end="00:22:24.140" style="s2"> Then I ran out of energy before I&#39;m pretty done</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.740" end="00:22:27.400" style="s2"> Also if you study and sleep and it&#39;s also the case that if you study and than sleep</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.400" end="00:22:31.300" style="s2"> Sleep and learn again, learn again and sleep again, spread the learning away and than study and then sleep, you space it out</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.300" end="00:22:32.820" style="s2"> It’s easier for you to remember what you learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.320" end="00:22:36.790" style="s2"> It&#39;s also much more likely that you&#39;re much more likely</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.790" end="00:22:38.540" style="s2"> To remember if you try to recall the material.</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.540" end="00:22:42.280" style="s2"> It’s useless to highlight and so highlighting and that sort of thing isn&#39;t very useful</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.280" end="00:22:46.380" style="s2"> Read carefully and then close the book, but reading, closing the book, summarising what you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.380" end="00:22:49.400" style="s2"> Don&#39;t peek at this is useful without opening the damn book, that&#39;s useful.</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.920" style="s2"> Because this way you are exercising the ability to remember and the reason for that is that you&#39;re practising remembering.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2"> And that&#39;s what you really need to exercise and that&#39;s what you have to practise.</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.580" style="s2"> If you&#39;re practising memorisation, you have to practise remembering.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:01.230" style="s2"> Instead of repeating memorization mechanically, you don&#39;t just go over the thing over and over;</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.230" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2"> That&#39;ll help you with recognition memory, some,</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:06.260" style="s2"> But it won&#39;t help you with recall memory.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.500" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2"> Back to the topic The last character trait is Anyways, the last trait is openness.</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.400" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2"> Openness is a creativity trait.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:14.460" style="s2"> It&#39;s also associated with intelligence, in that intelligent people</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.580" end="00:23:16.800" style="s2"> Specifically, I mean IQ and I&#39;m speaking technically of IQ,</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:22.180" style="s2"> People with high IQ have higher creativity. It’s nothing surprising. tend to be higher in, tend to be more creative, which is hardly surprising,</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.580" end="00:23:26.800" style="s2"> By the way, creative people are more likely to be liberal politically, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.620" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2"> They like unique styles, they like aesthetics, they like novels, they like novelty, they like aesthetics, they like fiction,</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2"> They like movies, they like art, they like poetry.</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:39.500" style="s2"> There&#39;s something about them that grants them an aesthetic sensitivity.</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.840" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2"> And that&#39;s an inbuilt trait.</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.980" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2"> It&#39;s not the case, by the way, that everyone&#39;s creative.</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:48.360" style="s2"> In fact, a small number of people are creative. In fact, far from it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.500" end="00:23:51.060" style="s2"> We&#39;ve used the Creative Achievement Questionnaire to--</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.940" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2"> To measure people&#39;s creativity,</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:55.180" style="s2"> I will talk about this part in the class later and I&#39;ll talk to you about that later in the class.</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2"> And the Creative Achievement Questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.980" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2"> Takes thirteen dimensions of creativity from 13 dimensions -</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.380" end="00:24:04.980" style="s2"> For example, writing, dancing, acting, scientific investigation, so, you know, writing, dancing, acting, scientific investigation,</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.980" end="00:24:08.420" style="s2"> Entrepreneurial activity, architectural activity,</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.080" end="00:24:10.460" style="s2"> Cooking...</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.020" end="00:24:13.540" style="s2"> There&#39;s a handful of others... singing, etc...</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:15.260" style="s2"> All in all, you know, the sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.260" end="00:24:17.720" style="s2"> You would assume that people could be creative about -</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.720" end="00:24:22.340" style="s2"> People need to rate themselves on a scale from 1 to 10 and then it asks people to rate themselves on a scale from 1 to 10</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.820" end="00:24:27.380" style="s2"> On their level of achievement with regards to all those creative domains</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.380" end="00:24:31.680" style="s2"> 0 means I have not received any training in this area, nor have any attainments with zero being &quot;I have no training or proficiency in this area,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.680" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2"> The result shows that 70% of people and 70% of people score zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2"> There is no cross the entire Creative Achievement Questionnaire for a creative project.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2"> A tiny proportion of people are outliers, way out,</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2"> At the same time have made achievements in multiple creative fields and they&#39;re creative in many dimensions simultaneously.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.740" end="00:24:45.340" style="s2"> And have a high degree of creativity Exceptionally creative.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.340" end="00:24:47.170" style="s2"> And this phenomenon you will find It turns out, as you&#39;ll find out,</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.170" end="00:24:49.640" style="s2"> That that pattern, which is called a Pareto distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.680" end="00:24:51.800" style="s2"> Where most people stack up at zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.800" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2"> And a few people are way out on the creative end</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.780" end="00:24:57.800" style="s2"> Characterizes all sorts of distributions,</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.800" end="00:25:00.020" style="s2"> For example, wealth like the distribution of money, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.020" end="00:25:02.520" style="s2"> Which is why 1% of the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:06.200" style="s2"> Have the overwhelming majority of the money.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.540" end="00:25:09.180" style="s2"> It&#39;s a different 1% across time.</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.540" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2"> It is floating It churns.</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.180" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2"> And you&#39;re much more likely to be in the 1%</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:15.980" style="s2"> The more likely you are to squeeze in that 1%, which is reasonable if you&#39;re older, logically enough,</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.980" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2"> Because one of the things you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:20.780" style="s2"> You will trade youth for money as you age is you trade youth for money.</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.780" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2"> If you&#39;re fortunate.</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:25.940" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think the trade is fair but it may be the best case. I don&#39;t think the trade is really worth it, but that&#39;s the best you&#39;ve got.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.700" end="00:25:27.960" style="s2"> So back to the topic So, anyways...</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:29.670" style="s2"> Those particular traits,</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.670" end="00:25:33.660" style="s2"> You can think of those as ways that you simplify the world, right?</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.900" style="s2"> There&#39;s lots of different places that you can act in the world,</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.900" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2"> There&#39;s lots of different ways you can look at it and survive.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2"> That&#39;s why you can be a plumber, and a lawyer,</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:46.140" style="s2"> There are lawyers, engineers, etc. and an engineer, and those all work, right,</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:48.360" style="s2"> Even though they&#39;re very different modes of being.</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.620" end="00:25:51.820" style="s2"> People can have different personalities, and survive,</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.820" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2"> As long as you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:59.780" style="s2"> Finding the place where your particular filters and behavioral proclivities</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.780" end="00:26:01.980" style="s2"> Match the demand of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.980" end="00:26:06.780" style="s2"> And a large part of the so-called successful adaptation refers to this. And a huge part, I would say, of successful adaptation is precisely that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.880" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2"> Personality also contains other elements. Now there are other elements of personality too.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.520" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2"> I have a different view on one of the elements. One of the elements I&#39;ve been struck by;</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:14.920" style="s2"> This is what I mean to psychoanalysts and clinicians, and this is actually one of the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.920" end="00:26:17.460" style="s2"> I have about the psychoanalysts and the clinicians in general,</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2"> Of course I still admire them (even though I have great admiration for them and would say that,</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2"> Their theories are also worth listening to what they have to say is very much worth listening to),</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.680" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2"> But I don&#39;t think that personality is inside you. is that, it&#39;s not obvious that your personality is inside you.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.800" end="00:26:30.520" style="s2"> You know, you think,</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:34.620" style="s2"> You know, a human being is a strange multilevel thing.</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.240" end="00:26:37.300" style="s2"> For example, you might ask yourself, and you might ask yourself, well for example,</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.540" end="00:26:41.780" style="s2"> Is your mother a more part of you than your arm?&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.540" end="00:26:44.160" style="s2"> Or maybe even more precisely,</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.160" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2"> Is your child more a part of you than your arm?&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:52.040" style="s2"> Certainly, people will do drastically self-sacrificing things</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.040" end="00:26:54.360" style="s2"> Let the children live to maintain the lives of their children.</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.800" end="00:26:56.590" style="s2"> So as a person and so you&#39;re-you&#39;re a person</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.590" end="00:27:00.380" style="s2"> You are made up of many small parts and you&#39;re made up all sub-sort of subcomponents of a person,</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.380" end="00:27:02.680" style="s2"> None of which you can seen when you look at a person.</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.920" end="00:27:05.140" style="s2"> All the complicated machinery inside you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.140" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2"> That makes you who you are, and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:08.340" style="s2"> And outside of that of course,</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2"> You&#39;re nested in all sorts of complex system</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:14.730" style="s2"> So you&#39;re part of the family, and-and you&#39;re part of a community,</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.730" end="00:27:18.100" style="s2"> The community belongs to the province, the province belongs to the country and that&#39;s part of a province, and that&#39;s part of state, and that&#39;s part of...</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.100" end="00:27:20.450" style="s2"> Belongs to an international consortium of states,</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.450" end="00:27:21.910" style="s2"> Belong to an ecosystem and that&#39;s part of an ecosystem,</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.910" end="00:27:25.800" style="s2"> And how you make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.800" end="00:27:28.580" style="s2"> .With such a complex link between you and the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.580" end="00:27:32.120" style="s2"> It is also very difficult to distinguish the system environment, you&#39;re embeded in is also of extraordinary difficulty.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.820" end="00:27:36.210" style="s2"> One of the things you have to do as a clinical psychologist, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.210" end="00:27:38.580" style="s2"> If you&#39;re trying to diagnose someone with depression,</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.580" end="00:27:41.900" style="s2"> You think oh, this person is dreadfully unhappy...you think &quot;Well, this person is dreadfully unhappy&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:44.180" style="s2"> Well, you can think about that as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.180" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2"> With their psychological adjustment-</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2"> You know, the way that they&#39;re looking at the world.</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2"> But if you look at the...</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.660" end="00:27:53.400" style="s2"> Epidemiological information...epidemiological literature,</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:27:54.540" style="s2"> For example, one of the things that you find is that very many people...</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.580" end="00:28:00.360" style="s2"> After suffering a major blow...have a first depressive episode</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.360" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2"> Depressive symptoms that have never occurred before will appear after something genuinely terrible has happened to them.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.980" end="00:28:06.580" style="s2"> For example, they lost their loved ones or were seriously injured Right? They&#39;ve lost someone or they&#39;ve become injured or...</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.580" end="00:28:08.580" style="s2"> Or unemployed...or they&#39;ve become unemployed</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.580" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2"> Because unemployment is a terrible shock to people...</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually hard to judge...and it&#39;s not precisely self-evident that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:17.170" style="s2"> You can consider someone who&#39;s unhappy and desperate</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.170" end="00:28:20.520" style="s2"> Is it because he lost his job or is he depressed-because they no longer have a job-depressed.</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.420" style="s2"> They&#39;re certainly sad and they&#39;re not doing very well, but...</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.820" end="00:28:28.200" style="s2"> Because there is no fixed income...the fact that they no longer have an income...</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.200" end="00:28:32.690" style="s2"> Will have a dramatic practical impact on people... is actually something with dramatic practical consequences,</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.690" end="00:28:36.650" style="s2"> But treating that as if it&#39;s a mental disorder seems to be...</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.620" end="00:28:38.760" style="s2"> It is often counterproductive.</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.900" end="00:28:41.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s also the case, for example...</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.400" end="00:28:45.740" style="s2"> If someone comes in to you, to talk to you, and they&#39;re very upset and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2"> And show anxiety disorder...they may manifest the signs of, say, an anxiety disorder</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:51.220" style="s2"> Or symptoms of depression or, again, depression or other...</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:53.380" style="s2"> Or other clinical features...other clinical features, for that matter,</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:53.940" style="s2"> Cough...ahem...</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:28:57.380" style="s2"> Then you may need to analyze carefully...you have to do a careful analysis of the manner</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.380" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2"> The family environment he is in in which they&#39;re embedded in their family because,</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.060" end="00:29:02.200" style="s2"> This is also when we talk about Freud later...and this is something that we&#39;ll talk about quite...</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.520" end="00:29:07.180" style="s2"> Will discuss in depth...thoroughly when we come to discussing Freud, is that,</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.180" end="00:29:10.180" style="s2"> You know that not all families are well, you know, it&#39;s not like everybody&#39;s families are necessarily,</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.180" end="00:29:12.040" style="s2"> Particularly happy places to be.</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.040" end="00:29:13.000" style="s2"> You know, i mean...</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.180" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2"> Human beings are very dependent.</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:18.100" style="s2"> We have a very long period of dependency, partly because...</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.100" end="00:29:20.650" style="s2"> Our cerebral cortex is very developed we&#39;re so cortically hyper-developed that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.650" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2"> It takes a very long time to program us into something that&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:27.300" style="s2"> Vaguely capable of maneuvering on its own, and...</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:31.540" style="s2"> This makes us form a close family bond that produces, of course, the very tight familial bonds that we all...</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2"> This is something we all desire deeply...that we all desperately require,</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:35.960" style="s2"> After all, who wants to be alone in the world because-who wants to be alone in the world?...</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.040" end="00:29:36.940" style="s2"> But at the same time...but it also...</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.580" end="00:29:43.100" style="s2"> It also exposes us to the probability of becoming entangled into...</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:46.120" style="s2"> Causes in generations of families...even multigenerational family pathology</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2"> At least as far as I know...and it isn&#39;t obvious, always and certainly hasn&#39;t been to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:51.920" style="s2"> When I&#39;ve seen my clients</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.920" end="00:29:55.890" style="s2"> Their fundamental problem does not lie in themselves that the fundamental problem with the client, is the client</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.890" end="00:29:58.150" style="s2"> It lies in Sometimes, the fundamental problem is...</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:01.380" style="s2"> Their family...is the family.</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.980" end="00:30:08.100" style="s2"> And the reason why the patient is considered to be the source of the problem and perhaps that person has been identified as the problem person.</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.100" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2"> It&#39;s rather convenient for everyone who&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.600" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2"> This assumption is the most convenient to make that presupposition.</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:14.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s also the case that,</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:17.210" style="s2"> This is the Freudian idea fundamentally,</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.210" end="00:30:18.700" style="s2"> This is the Oedipus idea that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.480" end="00:30:20.660" style="s2"> It&#39;s very easy for</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:23.460" style="s2"> People to become over dependent on their parents</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.460" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2"> Or parents’ spoiling has caused the child’s over-dependence and, and for the parents to facilitate that,</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:29.340" style="s2"> And therefore for the individual and then for the primary developmental problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.120" end="00:30:31.380" style="s2"> The primary growth issue for the individual,</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:38.600" style="s2"> In fact to become free of interfering elements of the family</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.660" end="00:30:43.080" style="s2"> And make yourself independent individuals so that they can exist as independent individuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.800" end="00:30:46.190" style="s2"> Of course there are cultural differences and then of course there are cultural variations in that,</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.190" end="00:30:48.900" style="s2"> This also makes this theory complicated that make that proposition complex,</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.080" end="00:30:53.180" style="s2"> But overall this is the basis of Freudian psychology but, that&#39;s a fundamental tenant, say, of Freudian psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:54.260" style="s2"> A lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.000" end="00:30:57.000" style="s2"> The clinical psychologists,</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.000" end="00:30:59.480" style="s2"> And all the psychologists we have contacted all of whom, that we&#39;re going to study,</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.720" end="00:31:02.340" style="s2"> The viewpoints held are very westernized. have a pronounced western orientation.</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.620" end="00:31:05.300" style="s2"> One of the fundamental presuppositions is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.040" end="00:31:07.380" style="s2"> Part of the hallmark of positive psychology development</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.060" end="00:31:09.960" style="s2"> A feature positive psychological development</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.400" end="00:31:13.720" style="s2"> Is the creation of an individual that&#39;s capable of acting</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:15.660" style="s2"> Individuals capable of acting independently, and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:18.020" style="s2"> I think this idea is implicit in I would say an implicit ideal</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.180" end="00:31:21.320" style="s2"> That lurks at the bottom of the clinical presuppositions of all classic psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.500" end="00:31:24.300" style="s2"> Of all the theorists that are classic Npsychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.500" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2"> This is a very old picture.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.680" end="00:31:36.840" style="s2"> The picture is Jonah emerging from the whale. It&#39;s Jonah emerging from the whale.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.160" end="00:31:38.440" style="s2"> It evolved from It&#39;s a variant of a,</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.840" end="00:31:39.460" style="s2"> A legend a myth.</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.300" end="00:31:41.140" style="s2"> One about The myth is,</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.140" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2"> The dragon myth, I suppose.</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.210" end="00:31:46.340" style="s2"> The dragon myth is that there&#39;s a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.340" end="00:31:50.130" style="s2"> It lives under the ground that&#39;s eternal,</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.090" end="00:31:55.010" style="s2"> From time to time it will come out of the ground to threaten the world and now and then it rises out of the ground to threaten the state.</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.010" end="00:31:59.640" style="s2"> Every time someone in the world will take the initiative to stand up and someone within the state determines</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.230" end="00:32:04.440" style="s2"> To go confront the dragon voluntarily, and does so,</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.440" end="00:32:07.320" style="s2"> And bring back the treasure from the dragon and then brings back something of great value.</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:12.700" style="s2"> The hero is generally male,</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.700" end="00:32:14.660" style="s2"> Sometimes the thing of great value</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.660" end="00:32:17.790" style="s2"> Is the female that the dragon has kidnapped,</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.790" end="00:32:19.450" style="s2"> That’s a St. George story,</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.450" end="00:32:22.160" style="s2"> Sometimes the warriors brought back gold and silver jewelry, and sometimes it&#39;s gold and other treasure,</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.160" end="00:32:24.040" style="s2"> That was interpreted as a story of the Hobbit like in the story of the Hobbit.</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.170" end="00:32:27.500" style="s2"> A story that you all know very well.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.500" end="00:32:29.000" style="s2"> It&#39;s a classic hero story,</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.000" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2"> And this hero story is also and the hero story is another fundamental element</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:35.680" style="s2"> A basic element of the clinical theories, I would say.</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.680" end="00:32:39.890" style="s2"> This theory believes that it&#39;s predicated on the idea that you learn</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.890" end="00:32:44.060" style="s2"> The things that make you afraid or disgusting through voluntary contact with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.060" end="00:32:46.400" style="s2"> You will gain something that frightens or disgusts you.</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.190" end="00:32:50.690" style="s2"> This is also the characteristic of psychoanalytic theory And that&#39;s a hallmark of psychoanalytic theory.</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.690" end="00:32:53.400" style="s2"> Carl Jung, who we&#39;ll discuss in detail, said</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.400" end="00:32:58.450" style="s2"> His classic saying is (Latin) in sterquiliniis invenitur his primary dictum was “in sterquiliniis invenitur” (Latin),</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.450" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2"> Ignore my fake Latin pronunciation which I am sure I&#39;m massacring because it&#39;s Latin.</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.330" style="s2"> It means: What you are looking for is hidden in the most unsightly place. But it meant “in filth it will be found”.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.330" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2"> And one of the characteristics of clinical theory is And one of the hallmarks of the clinical theories</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:11.510" style="s2"> Is that within the confines of everyone&#39;s experience,</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.510" end="00:33:14.680" style="s2"> This experience can be actual social experience and you can think about this as experience out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.680" end="00:33:17.050" style="s2"> It can also be your subconscious travel or experience in the unconscious mind,</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.050" end="00:33:22.390" style="s2"> There are dirty little secrets, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.390" end="00:33:29.150" style="s2"> There are skeletons and dreadful, old fears and skeletons and dreadful, old fears</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.150" end="00:33:34.740" style="s2"> There are traumas of abuse and memories of pathological behavior and remnants of abuse and memories of pathological behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.740" end="00:33:39.620" style="s2"> And the growth and failures of courage that leave you undeveloped,</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.740" end="00:33:42.450" style="s2"> It may be due to escape. Perhaps out of avoidance.</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.450" end="00:33:44.830" style="s2"> And that the psychoanalytic process</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.830" end="00:33:49.590" style="s2"> Is precisely the careful encounter with the forgotten and suppressed part of myself</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.590" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2"> Those forgotten and repressed elements of the self,</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:00.260" style="s2"> In the hope that a clear encounter will redeem them,</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.260" end="00:34:03.270" style="s2"> Unite them with the remainder of your personality,</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.270" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2"> To make yourself stronger and make you stronger in consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2"> I think this is also a kind of and I would say that&#39;s just a variant</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:12.230" style="s2"> Of the manner in which human beings learn,</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.230" end="00:34:16.030" style="s2"> When we talk about Piaget, we will have a more in-depth discussion and we&#39;ll talk about this more in relation to Piaget, because</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.650" end="00:34:18.490" style="s2"> You always learn when you&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.870" end="00:34:21.120" style="s2"> Although this is very annoying.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.950" end="00:34:23.740" style="s2"> So what do you learn when you&#39;re correct?</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.740" end="00:34:26.500" style="s2"> You&#39;re walking in the world, you&#39;re operating in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.500" end="00:34:30.130" style="s2"> You have a sense of what you want to have happen.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.130" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2"> You are through &quot;what you want to happen&quot; You&#39;re always looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:34.670" style="s2"> Come to see the world through this sense of what you want to have happen.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.670" end="00:34:39.130" style="s2"> Your every move is trying to achieve what you want to happen. You&#39;re acting so that what you want to have happen will happen.</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.130" end="00:34:42.300" style="s2"> And when it happens, then you&#39;re happy.</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.300" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2"> Because first of all you get what you want, and that&#39;s good, maybe,</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:48.440" style="s2"> Depending on what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.440" end="00:34:52.110" style="s2"> Secondly, if your behavior helps you realize your wish, but it&#39;s also good because if you get what you want when you act,</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.110" end="00:34:55.900" style="s2"> This means that your model of behavior is correct, then it turns out that your model of how to act is valid, right?</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.900" end="00:34:59.950" style="s2"> Because you got what you want The outcome that you get what you want indicates no error</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.950" end="00:35:01.530" style="s2"> It means that your model is correct on the part of your model.</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.530" end="00:35:04.660" style="s2"> But it&#39;s very frequently the case that,</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.660" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2"> When you act to get what you want,</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:08.710" style="s2"> You don&#39;t get what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.540" end="00:35:13.460" style="s2"> It&#39;s very unpleasant because you can&#39;t get what you want and then, that&#39;s unpleasant, because you don&#39;t get what you want,</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.590" end="00:35:15.710" style="s2"> But it&#39;s even more unpleasant because</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.710" end="00:35:17.840" style="s2"> Your failure means it brings with it the hint of a suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.840" end="00:35:20.340" style="s2"> The way you understand the world that the manner in which you&#39;re construing the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.340" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2"> Is incorrect at some indeterminate level.</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.430" end="00:35:31.650" style="s2"> So for example, if you tell a joke at a party,</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.270" end="00:35:34.060" style="s2"> You presume that people will attend,</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.060" end="00:35:37.230" style="s2"> Suppose they will laugh when they hear it and then when they hear the joke they will laugh.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.230" end="00:35:41.360" style="s2"> But if you tell the joke and it goes flat, or even worse,</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.360" end="00:35:43.950" style="s2"> Even feel sick or offended disgusts and offends people,</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.950" end="00:35:46.660" style="s2"> Then you will be surprised. Then you&#39;re going to be taken aback.</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.660" end="00:35:49.370" style="s2"> And that&#39;s partly because you didn&#39;t get what you want,</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.370" end="00:35:50.460" style="s2"> It feels bad and that&#39;s not so good,</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.460" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2"> But what’s worse is that you find the way you understand the situation but it&#39;s more because there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:56.630" style="s2"> There is also a mistake with the way you conceptualize the situation.</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:35:59.010" style="s2"> And then you&#39;re faced with a problem,</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.010" end="00:36:03.180" style="s2"> An unknown domain emerges before you and the problem is the emergence of a domain of the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.180" end="00:36:05.550" style="s2"> You will wonder where did I go wrong Well what kind of mistake did you make?</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.550" end="00:36:07.600" style="s2"> Maybe you&#39;re not as funny as you think you are.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:10.140" style="s2"> This is a big problem. That could be a big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.810" end="00:36:12.730" style="s2"> Maybe you&#39;re not around people</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.730" end="00:36:15.110" style="s2"> It&#39;s not the same as I think. Who are the way you think they are.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.110" end="00:36:17.940" style="s2"> Maybe they don&#39;t like you as much as you thought they liked you.</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.940" end="00:36:22.860" style="s2"> The potential for various paranoid thoughts appear in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.860" end="00:36:26.530" style="s2"> One is more serious than the other of increasing severity to come welling up at you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.530" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2"> Even if you make a small social mistake in a situation where you make</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2"> You will also think of various possibilities even a trivial social mistake is quite broad.</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.910" end="00:36:34.290" style="s2"> And when you make an error of that sort,</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:38.210" style="s2"> You have to face it and sort through all the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.210" end="00:36:41.670" style="s2"> So that you can find out what it was you did wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.670" end="00:36:44.380" style="s2"> And find ways to improve and how to re-tool it so that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.380" end="00:36:46.300" style="s2"> You don&#39;t make the same mistake.</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.300" end="00:36:49.930" style="s2"> And that requires in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.930" end="00:36:51.600" style="s2"> Carry on a what you might describe as a journey</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.600" end="00:36:52.850" style="s2"> To the journey into the belly of the beast,</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.850" end="00:36:56.270" style="s2"> [Beast of the beast] the beast being that place where things have fallen apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.270" end="00:36:58.440" style="s2"> Where you&#39;re overwhelmed with negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.440" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2"> Facing chaos, you are confused and chaos and confusion.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.570" end="00:37:01.990" style="s2"> That&#39;s a very old story.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:04.700" style="s2"> That&#39;s the story of the journey to the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.700" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2"> And the hero is the person in the story</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.370" style="s2"> Who makes the voluntary journey to the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.370" end="00:37:11.750" style="s2"> To collect what&#39;s been languishing down there,</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.750" end="00:37:15.830" style="s2"> This is the main theme of psychoanalytic theory and that&#39;s the basic motif of psychoanalytic theory.</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.830" end="00:37:20.210" style="s2"> From a certain perspective, this is also the main theme of clinical practice. I would say it&#39;s the basic motif, in some sense, of clinical practice.</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.210" end="00:37:23.590" style="s2"> One of your tasks as a clinician is because one of the things you do as a clinician</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.590" end="00:37:29.100" style="s2"> Find out what people are afraid of and what they&#39;re avoiding—</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.100" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2"> This may exist in the patient’s past, present or future and that can be in their past or in their present or in their future—</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:35.850" style="s2"> Break it down into smaller pieces,</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.850" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2"> Help patients develop strategies for approaching or controlling them and help them devise strategies of approach and mastery.</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:44.360" style="s2"> And that improves the quality of their personality,</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.360" end="00:37:48.490" style="s2"> Will also help them avoid and helps develop them into people</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.490" end="00:37:51.240" style="s2"> Who won&#39;t make the same mistakes over and over again.</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.080" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2"> So why do we need so many theoretical tools? Alright, so, why is this plethora of tools?</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:05.260" style="s2"> I said before, in some sense being a personality psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.260" end="00:38:06.510" style="s2"> Is like being an engineer.</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.550" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2"> You&#39;re trying to build better people.</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.140" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2"> For example, if you are a carpenter or a mechanic, you might say that if you&#39;re a carpenter or a mechanic</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:19.690" style="s2"> Then your ability to fix a vehicle or build a house</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.520" end="00:38:22.150" style="s2"> Is dependent on your proficiency</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.150" end="00:38:24.990" style="s2"> The proficiency of various tools with regards to the use of a multitude of tools.</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.650" end="00:38:28.950" style="s2"> It can be said that the more tools you can master, then you might say that the more tools you have at your disposal,</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:33.910" style="s2"> The more likely it is that you&#39;re going to manage things properly.</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.910" end="00:38:36.790" style="s2"> So in this course So what I would like to offer you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.790" end="00:38:39.670" style="s2"> What I want to teach you is is the possibility that what you&#39;re going to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.670" end="00:38:45.960" style="s2"> In this course is a series of sophisticated conceptual tools</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.340" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2"> They can help you understand yourself better,</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.010" end="00:38:52.260" style="s2"> Live better in this world and therefore better orient yourself in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.260" end="00:38:56.060" style="s2"> I regard this course as intensely practical,</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2"> Because I believe and that&#39;s because I believe that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:02.110" style="s2"> Have nothing to rely on in your life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.110" end="00:39:07.740" style="s2"> The most crucial thing to help you succeed more crucial to your success as you move through life</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.740" end="00:39:10.030" style="s2"> It is your own character and personality than your character and your personality.</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.030" end="00:39:12.700" style="s2"> Your character and personality affect you at any time that&#39;s what you bring to every situation,</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.700" end="00:39:16.330" style="s2"> When getting along with others and with yourself and the more sophisticated you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.330" end="00:39:18.870" style="s2"> The more experienced you are in relationship to yourself and others,</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.870" end="00:39:21.250" style="s2"> The more you understand people</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:24.590" style="s2"> The more you understand the nature of your own being,</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.590" end="00:39:28.630" style="s2"> Then the more likely it is that you&#39;re going to proceed through your life</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.630" end="00:39:33.470" style="s2"> The more you can live happily in a manner that will make you pleased to exist</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.470" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2"> Rather than displeased to exist.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.350" end="00:39:39.940" style="s2"> The reading list of this course contains many articles I&#39;ve collected the writings of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.270" style="s2"> Written by someone I think is unmatched that I regard as of incomparable brilliance.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:46.780" style="s2"> They&#39;re difficult to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.780" end="00:39:49.360" style="s2"> The concepts are complex.</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.360" end="00:39:50.700" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not surprising,</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.700" end="00:39:54.280" style="s2"> Because this subject is complex and vital because the subject matter is complex and vital.</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.780" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2"> So you need to work hard and so it requires work,</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:39:59.160" style="s2"> To do your best and I would say try to keep up on the readings,</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.160" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2"> Complete every reading if you would.</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:03.500" style="s2"> This will make you a lot richer in this course. It&#39;s going to make the course much richer for you.</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.500" end="00:40:04.710" style="s2"> And I would say,</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.710" end="00:40:08.050" style="s2"> Cuz people often ask me how should I read for this course?</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.050" end="00:40:09.590" style="s2"> There&#39;s so much material to read&#39;Cuz there&#39;s a lot of reading.</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.170" end="00:40:13.840" style="s2"> My answer is to read them as if it matters. And the answer is: read as if it matters.</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:16.010" style="s2"> That&#39;s the right answer.</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:18.680" style="s2"> Don&#39;t be thinking about how it&#39;s going to be tested.</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.680" end="00:40:21.140" style="s2"> If you do the readings and you come to the lectures then</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.140" end="00:40:24.150" style="s2"> Then the tests aren&#39;t particularly difficult for you.</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.650" end="00:40:27.320" style="s2"> But the key is that you should pay attention to those readings</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.320" end="00:40:29.360" style="s2"> Think of them as if the person is writing about you.</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.070" end="00:40:32.490" style="s2"> And you should try to understand what the person says,</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.490" end="00:40:34.780" style="s2"> Because they can also be your tools because it&#39;s another tool for you to use.</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.320" end="00:40:37.950" style="s2"> In the face of patients And I would say, well, with my clients</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.370" end="00:40:41.500" style="s2"> I use the approaches of one theorist for one client</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.500" end="00:40:43.750" style="s2"> Use different theories on different patients and the approaches of another theorist for another client,</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.750" end="00:40:45.710" style="s2"> To a certain extent it seems to me to depend on some degree</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.710" end="00:40:48.380" style="s2"> It depends on the patient&#39;s own temperament actually on the temperament of the client.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.380" end="00:40:50.300" style="s2"> For example, those I&#39;ve found for example that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.300" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2"> Who are very high in openness,</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:53.590" style="s2"> That is to say those who are creative which is the creativity dimension,</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.590" end="00:40:57.350" style="s2"> They are quite amenable to a Jungian approach.</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.350" end="00:41:00.390" style="s2"> But for those who are more practical, conscientious,</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.390" end="00:41:04.230" style="s2"> People with low experience openness, behavior therapy will be more effective low in openness, are much more amenable to a behaviorist approach.</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.230" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2"> We don&#39;t really know enough about psychology yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.560" end="00:41:10.360" style="s2"> Can’t match every temperament and treatment to match treatment to temperament,</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.360" end="00:41:14.530" style="s2"> I just talked about my experience but those are some of the things that I&#39;ve experienced.</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.860" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2"> Okay, practicalities.</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.280" end="00:41:20.410" style="s2"> Well, there&#39;s a website.</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.410" end="00:41:23.620" style="s2"> I just gave you the URL, I&#39;ll put it up at the end of class. I gave you the URL, I&#39;ll put it up at the end of class.</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.210" end="00:41:27.710" style="s2"> The URL lists all the readings that aren&#39;t in the textbook.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.710" end="00:41:30.840" style="s2"> In other words, there are classic readings in the textbooks,</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.840" end="00:41:37.090" style="s2"> From Jung Freud Piaget readings from people like Jung and Freud and Piaget, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.090" end="00:41:38.180" style="s2"> Rogers wait Rogers.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.850" end="00:41:41.010" style="s2"> I chose this book because And as I said, I picked that particular textbook</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.010" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2"> I believe that the author did a very credible job</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:47.850" style="s2"> That is, summarizing what&#39;s very difficult to summarize.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.440" end="00:41:52.900" style="s2"> And those articles in the website So, and then also on the website there are links to papers,</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.900" end="00:41:55.650" style="s2"> Because much of the more modern material</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:41:58.620" style="s2"> Related to neuroscience that pertains say, to neuroscience,</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.620" end="00:42:00.370" style="s2"> And also to trait personality,</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.370" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2"> You are going to read those first-hand materials I think it&#39;s better to just read the original papers</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:06.330" style="s2"> I will also do a detailed interpretation during class and I&#39;ll detail them out with you as we go through.</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.330" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2"> Those articles can make you familiar with that&#39;ll also give you some familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:10.090" style="s2"> Original psychological papers with original psychological papers.</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.090" end="00:42:14.170" style="s2"> Just as the saying goes Which are, again—there&#39;s an idiom</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.170" end="00:42:17.180" style="s2"> Gewuzhizhi that you have to master in order to understand them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.180" end="00:42:19.590" style="s2"> You can practice more but you might as well practice,</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.590" end="00:42:23.350" style="s2"> Especially if you want to go deeper in psychology it is especially if you&#39;re interested in continuing with psychology</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.350" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2"> Such as being an educator or a psychologist in your educational practice or as a career.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.600" end="00:42:29.100" style="s2"> It&#39;s good to get accustomed to it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.190" end="00:42:36.740" style="s2"> You can remember this URL. So there again is the URL for the class.</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.740" end="00:42:38.780" style="s2"> jordanbpeterson.com If you go to jordanpbeterson.com,</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.780" end="00:42:40.120" style="s2"> This URL should not be difficult to remember which isn&#39;t too hard to remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.120" end="00:42:42.240" style="s2"> Assuming you can remember my name,</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.240" end="00:42:45.790" style="s2"> On the left side of the page you can find a list of courses, then classes are listed on the left hand side.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.790" end="00:42:48.040" style="s2"> You can just find the syllabus there.</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2"> These are what we will learn. Oh so here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to cover.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.670" end="00:42:57.300" style="s2"> Today is mainly for course introduction and overview Today, obviously, this is the introduction and overview.</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.300" end="00:42:59.130" style="s2"> Class is a little strange this year because</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.130" end="00:43:01.510" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s one hour at a time, and the next two hours, one day it&#39;s an hour and the next day it&#39;s two hours,</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.510" end="00:43:04.430" style="s2"> So I don’t know exactly what to do for the time being, so not exactly sure how we&#39;re going to negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.430" end="00:43:06.390" style="s2"> But we will figure it out our way through that but we&#39;ll figure it out.</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.480" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2"> Historical Perspectives: Mythological Representations.</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:16.440" style="s2"> I told you I&#39;d try to provide you the meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.440" end="00:43:19.900" style="s2"> That might enable you to link the theories</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.900" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2"> We will learn the theories that we&#39;re going to talk about together,</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:23.160" style="s2"> So I will describe a kind of so I&#39;m going to describe to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.160" end="00:43:26.370" style="s2"> What you might regard as a conceptual language.</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.370" end="00:43:30.290" style="s2"> What I can say at the moment is As far as I can tell, it&#39;s that: imagine that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.290" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2"> Imagine that there are two kinds of things that you need to know.</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.500" end="00:43:35.380" style="s2"> And I think this is a fact I believe this to be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.380" end="00:43:38.260" style="s2"> You need to know what the world is made of, I believe you need to know what the world is made of,</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.260" end="00:43:40.930" style="s2"> I suppose that&#39;s the proper domain of science.</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:43.430" style="s2"> But then you need to know how to act.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.430" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2"> This is totally another field. And that&#39;s a whole different thing.</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:47.470" style="s2"> And you need to know how to act,</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.470" end="00:43:50.770" style="s2"> It&#39;s the thing you need to know most of anything.</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.770" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2"> After all you are a living creature because of course you&#39;re a living creature,</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.850" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2"> Action in relationship to desired goals</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:43:58.610" style="s2"> To you is life is everything to you.</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.610" end="00:44:01.450" style="s2"> You can think about that from a Darwinian perspective;</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.450" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2"> You have to act at least so that you can survive,</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2"> At least so that you can find a partner.</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:08.540" style="s2"> That&#39;s life!</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.540" end="00:44:10.330" style="s2"> So one question is So part of the question is:</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.330" end="00:44:12.170" style="s2"> If you imagine the world as a place of action how does the world look</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.170" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2"> What will it look like in your eyes if you think about it as a place to act?</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2"> And the answer isn&#39;t:</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2"> The world is full of worthless things a place of value-free objects.</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:22.010" style="s2"> That&#39;s not what the world looks like,</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.010" end="00:44:25.350" style="s2"> In a world where everything is worthless, you can’t act in a world of value-free objects</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.350" end="00:44:28.310" style="s2"> Because there&#39;s no way of choosing between them.</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.310" end="00:44:30.270" style="s2"> If everything has zero value,</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.270" end="00:44:33.100" style="s2"> How could you choose this and not that why would you choose one thing over another?</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.100" end="00:44:35.480" style="s2"> You live in a world where things</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.480" end="00:44:39.360" style="s2"> Present themselves to you as of different value,</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.360" end="00:44:41.860" style="s2"> This partly depends on your temperament and that&#39;s partly a consequence of your temperament,</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.860" end="00:44:43.740" style="s2"> Partly depends on other reasons although that&#39;s a consequence of other things.</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.740" end="00:44:46.830" style="s2"> So what I&#39;m going to try to do is to provide you in the next course</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.830" end="00:44:52.250" style="s2"> A framework that describes the world of morality with a schema that describes the world of morality,</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.250" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2"> Roughly speaking, a framework for a code of conduct is roughly speaking, which is how to act.</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2"> I will also tell you a little bit about what I think the language is from Darwin&#39;s theory,</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.050" style="s2"> Definition of language which I think was derived from Darwinian processes,</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.050" end="00:45:03.840" style="s2"> I think logically speaking those clinical theories and I believe it&#39;s within that structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.840" end="00:45:06.430" style="s2"> Contained in this structure that the clinical theories logically nest.</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.430" end="00:45:09.010" style="s2"> This can also help you so that&#39;ll give you a way of linking</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.010" end="00:45:12.020" style="s2"> Connect different theories from a conceptual perspective one theory to another from a conceptual perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.020" end="00:45:16.060" style="s2"> Rather than memorizing theories mechanically without having to rely so much on sheer memorization.</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.060" end="00:45:19.320" style="s2"> After that we will discuss the Heroic and Shamanic Initiations, then we&#39;ll talk about Heroic and Shamanic Initiations,</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.320" end="00:45:20.650" style="s2"> The reason for discussing them and the reason we&#39;re going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.650" end="00:45:24.950" style="s2"> Is because people used shamanic initiations</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.990" end="00:45:27.370" style="s2"> For tens of thousands of years all over the world,</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.370" end="00:45:29.030" style="s2"> It has its own system and they have a particular kind of structure.</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.030" end="00:45:31.370" style="s2"> There is an article by Mircea Eliade on the website The paper by Mircea Eliade,</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.370" end="00:45:34.120" style="s2"> Which is linked on the site, is very interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.120" end="00:45:36.250" style="s2"> One that details out some of these processes.</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.250" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2"> There have been intelligent commentators,</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:43.300" style="s2"> Like Henri Ellenberger, I think his book &quot;The Discovery of the Unconscious&quot; like Henri Ellenberger, who wrote The Discovery of the Unconscious,</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.300" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2"> Very outstanding which I think is an outstanding book,</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2"> He will psychoanalyst who linked the processes</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:50.100" style="s2"> At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century that the psychoanalysts uncovered</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.100" end="00:45:53.100" style="s2"> The process of discovery in the late part of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.100" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2"> Contacted and early part of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:57.850" style="s2"> Back to these more primordial rituals</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.850" end="00:45:59.810" style="s2"> The original ceremony of personality transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.810" end="00:46:03.740" style="s2"> So from a certain perspective So we&#39;re going to situate ourselves,</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.740" end="00:46:06.110" style="s2"> We will also be immersed in history in some sense, in deep history.</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.070" end="00:46:10.330" style="s2"> We will first discuss the underlying mythological landscape, Talking first about the underlying mythological landscape,</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.330" end="00:46:13.500" style="s2"> Then talking about archaic modes of personality conceptualization and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.500" end="00:46:16.120" style="s2"> Ancient model of personality conceptualization and transformation,</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.120" end="00:46:19.540" style="s2"> Discuss structuralism and then moving from there into Constructivism.</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.540" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2"> We will focus on Jean Piaget and we&#39;re going to concentrate mostly on Jean Piaget,</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:24.670" style="s2"> He is a developmental psychologist who was a developmental psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.720" end="00:46:28.220" style="s2"> Structuralists believe that Constructivists believe you make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.220" end="00:46:30.680" style="s2"> People build themselves out of the information that you gather in the world,</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.680" end="00:46:32.390" style="s2"> People are exploring animals so you&#39;re an exploring creature.</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.390" end="00:46:35.890" style="s2"> You explore specifically when the maps you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.890" end="00:46:38.690" style="s2"> Can&#39;t guide you well in the world are no longer orienting yourself properly,</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.690" end="00:46:39.900" style="s2"> Even when something goes wrong you will really start to explore the world when they&#39;re producing errors.</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.900" end="00:46:41.480" style="s2"> You go out and gather information,</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.480" end="00:46:44.940" style="s2"> Assemble yourself from the information that you discovered.</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.940" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2"> The next thing to be discussed is the depth psychologists Jung and Freud, then the depth psychologists Jung and Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2"> I will use some videos when introducing Jung. I think with Jung, I&#39;m going to walk you through some films.</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.540" end="00:46:57.540" style="s2"> I&#39;m not going to use the films, per se.</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.540" end="00:46:58.670" style="s2"> But will select some clips I&#39;m going to use clips;</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.580" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2"> In chronological order stills some of the film but you know the films.</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:04.460" style="s2"> Some well-known movie clips will be screened So in chronological order.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.460" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2"> I will explain to you and I&#39;m going to try to explain to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.300" style="s2"> How you might use Jungian presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.300" end="00:47:13.810" style="s2"> To understand what the films are about.</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.810" end="00:47:16.890" style="s2"> For example, the movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; If you think about a film, say, The Lion King,</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.890" end="00:47:18.890" style="s2"> That movie was very popular which was an extraordinarily popular film,</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.890" end="00:47:23.190" style="s2"> But isn&#39;t it strange that you go to watch &quot;The Lion King&quot; it&#39;s a very strange phenomena that you go and watch it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.190" end="00:47:24.230" style="s2"> Think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.230" end="00:47:27.530" style="s2"> To put it bluntly, it&#39;s drawings of animated animals</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.530" end="00:47:30.490" style="s2"> But in some sense represent you.</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.490" end="00:47:32.410" style="s2"> They&#39;re very low-resolution,</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.410" end="00:47:36.290" style="s2"> But you perceive them immediately as living things.</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.290" end="00:47:38.870" style="s2"> And you attribute to them motivation</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.870" end="00:47:42.130" style="s2"> And motive power and understanding.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:44.170" style="s2"> You do it automatically without even thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.170" end="00:47:46.300" style="s2"> And there&#39;s a classic plot behind those stories</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.300" end="00:47:48.050" style="s2"> There is a classic plot that lies underneath those stories,</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.050" end="00:47:51.090" style="s2"> This plot is very very very old and the plots are very very very very old.</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.840" end="00:47:53.430" style="s2"> So old that you must read it. That&#39;s why you can understand them.</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.430" end="00:47:55.260" style="s2"> The reason you can understand them</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.260" end="00:47:56.890" style="s2"> Life has a plot is because life has a plot.</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.890" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2"> Or maybe it has a couple of plots,</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2"> A multitude of plots,</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:01.350" style="s2"> In any case, life has a plot, but life has a plot.</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.350" end="00:48:01.940" style="s2"> And if it didn&#39;t,</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.940" end="00:48:03.480" style="s2"> We wouldn&#39;t be able to understand each other.</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.480" end="00:48:06.070" style="s2"> So I want to pass some movies So I&#39;d like to illustrate that for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.070" end="00:48:08.780" style="s2"> Let me explain this to you by analysis of some of these films.</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.610" end="00:48:10.570" style="s2"> I think this way is the best way I think it&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.570" end="00:48:13.450" style="s2"> To understand someone as sophisticated as Jung,</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:15.830" style="s2"> Because Jung is really difficult to interpret who is very difficult to get a handle on.</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.830" end="00:48:18.290" style="s2"> I will use the same method for Freud, I&#39;m going to do the same thing,</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.290" end="00:48:20.370" style="s2"> When talking about Freud, I will also play a film although I am going to show you a film with Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.370" end="00:48:22.120" style="s2"> This movie is called Crumb. I&#39;m going to show you a film called Crumb,</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.120" end="00:48:23.880" style="s2"> Which is a documentary,</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.880" end="00:48:27.750" style="s2"> About a troubled family and it&#39;s about a very badly enmeshed family,</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.750" end="00:48:30.420" style="s2"> All family members and the attempts of the family members to,</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.420" end="00:48:31.840" style="s2"> I suppose, escape it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.840" end="00:48:33.340" style="s2"> I&#39;ll talk to you about Freud,</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.340" end="00:48:33.970" style="s2"> I will show you the film, I&#39;ll show you the film,</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.970" end="00:48:35.010" style="s2"> You should be able to experience that should give you a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.010" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2"> Freudian psychopathology concept of Freudian psychopathology,</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:39.310" style="s2"> If he doesn&#39;t play the movie, he is afraid it is too difficult to understand which is a very difficult thing otherwise to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.350" end="00:48:41.730" style="s2"> Then there&#39;s a midterm exam.</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.730" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2"> The midterm is multiple choice.</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:44.900" style="s2"> You&#39;ll do it in class.</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.860" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2"> You&#39;ll have lots of time to finish it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:51.070" style="s2"> The content of the exam is the chapter we have learned by then. It&#39;ll cover the material that we&#39;ve studied up to that point.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.070" end="00:48:53.570" style="s2"> Then we&#39;ll talk about Rogers.</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.570" end="00:48:55.490" style="s2"> Carl Rogers is a humanist, Carl Rogers, who&#39;s a humanist.</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.490" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2"> Rogers has a body-centered philosophy, I suppose.</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:01.870" style="s2"> He&#39;s also interested as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.870" end="00:49:03.620" style="s2"> In optimal personal development</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.620" end="00:49:06.380" style="s2"> And the role that interpersonal communication plays in that.</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.380" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2"> Rogers&#39;s hypothesis, fundamentally,</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:10.170" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually very interesting and it&#39;s a very interesting one,</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.170" end="00:49:12.670" style="s2"> He thinks that the sincere communication between two people is that honest communication</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.670" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2"> Can make each other&#39;s personality transformation between two people can produce personality transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2"> You might think you kind of know that already,</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.430" end="00:49:22.850" style="s2"> When you have a deep, sincere conversation because there&#39;s something very engaging about a deep,</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.850" end="00:49:25.770" style="s2"> You can say some honest conversation where you&#39;re able to say things</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.770" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2"> You wouldn&#39;t normally say.</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:29.690" style="s2"> Where you&#39;d be listened to by someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.690" end="00:49:31.110" style="s2"> Seriously who&#39;s actually listening to you,</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.110" end="00:49:32.280" style="s2"> Listen to each other and you listen to them,</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.280" end="00:49:34.320" style="s2"> Through the conversation you will each other and in the conversation you&#39;re moving,</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.320" end="00:49:37.070" style="s2"> Something changed both you, forward to a different point.</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.070" end="00:49:38.620" style="s2"> That&#39;s different than a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.620" end="00:49:40.910" style="s2"> In daily conversation, you feel that you are right and want to convince me where you&#39;re right and you&#39;re trying to convince me,</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.910" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2"> Or I&#39;m right and I&#39;m trying to convince you,</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:45.210" style="s2"> This is a typical daily conversation which I&#39;d say is the typical conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.210" end="00:49:48.130" style="s2"> The healing conversation is more,</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.130" end="00:49:50.040" style="s2"> What&#39;s more about paying attention to you? what&#39;s up with you?</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.040" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2"> Are you okay? How are you doing?</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:52.260" style="s2"> What happened in your life? How&#39;s your life going?</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.260" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2"> What sort of problems are you facing?</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2"> What do you think about those problems? What do you think about those problems?</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:58.470" style="s2"> Do you have any solutions in your mind? Can you conceptualize what a solution might be?</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.470" end="00:50:00.470" style="s2"> Is there a way to implement these schemes? Is there a way we might figure out how to get there?</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.470" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2"> So it&#39;s a problem-solving conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:06.100" style="s2"> You first need to assume that it&#39;s predicated on the presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.100" end="00:50:07.650" style="s2"> That the person you&#39;re conversing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.650" end="00:50:10.610" style="s2"> Has the capacity to grow in a positive direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.610" end="00:50:11.900" style="s2"> If they so choose.</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.900" end="00:50:16.030" style="s2"> This is That&#39;s the fundamental presupposition of Rutgers Psychology</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.030" end="00:50:17.570" style="s2"> Basically assume of Rogerian psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.320" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2"> May and Frankl are also humanists.</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:24.750" style="s2"> I will continue to tell you in the next class I&#39;ll finish telling you what the rest of the material</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.750" end="00:50:26.120" style="s2"> The content of the second semester is the next time we meet.</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.120" end="00:50:28.540" style="s2"> I will talk about it now I should let you know a little more</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.540" end="00:50:29.880" style="s2"> About the structure of the course.</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.880" end="00:50:32.090" style="s2"> The second midterm is March 14</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.500" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2"> There&#39;s a final at the end as well.</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.180" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2"> The proportion of multiple choice questions is The multiple choice tests are graded in that manner,</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.430" style="s2"> 25% 25% and 27.5% 25%, 25%, and 27.5%.</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.430" end="00:50:48.270" style="s2"> The content of the exam is not cumulative. They&#39;re not cumulative.</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.980" end="00:50:51.110" style="s2"> Each test only covers what you covered before</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.650" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2"> What you learned after the last exam is the same for the final exam since the last test, including the final.</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:50:57.240" style="s2"> Another 15% of the grades are a small essay You&#39;ll be required to write an essay of 15%.</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.240" end="00:51:00.910" style="s2"> It&#39;s 1,000 words, sorry not 750 words.</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.910" end="00:51:03.330" style="s2"> And you&#39;ll also do an online exercise,</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.330" end="00:51:08.080" style="s2"> A personality analysis, which is pass/fail is not counted on a psychological test.</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.080" end="00:51:09.460" style="s2"> All you have to is complete it</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.460" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2"> And prove that you have completed it and show proof of completion.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:14.340" style="s2"> That test is a modified Big Five personality test It helps you do a modified Big Five analysis</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.340" end="00:51:15.590" style="s2"> About your own personality,</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.590" end="00:51:19.590" style="s2"> Concentrating on your virtues and your faults of it.</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.590" end="00:51:24.140" style="s2"> This test is to take the personality theory we have learned It&#39;s an active exercise in the application</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.140" end="00:51:27.310" style="s2"> Applied to personality theory of personality theory to personal development.</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.310" end="00:51:30.690" style="s2"> This is the structure of the course. So that&#39;s the structure of the course.</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.020" end="00:51:39.400" style="s2"> I can tell you there&#39;s a sign-up sheet on the syllabus.</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.860" end="00:51:42.780" style="s2"> I have broken the essays down for the entire semester</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.780" end="00:51:45.160" style="s2"> There are several categories into multiple types across the entire semester.</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.160" end="00:51:47.660" style="s2"> I would highly recommend you go there and sign up,</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.660" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2"> There are limited slots for each topic.</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2"> The reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want my teaching assistant to breathe at the end of the term I don&#39;t want my TA to have to grade 200 essays</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2"> Corrected 200 papers the last week of classes.</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:51:58.090" style="s2"> So we have to spread them out across the year.</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.090" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2"> So remember to choose a topic you want to do and sign up So figure out a topic and sign up.</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:04.470" style="s2"> Please do that sooner rather than later.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.470" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2"> This can also help you study diligently. It&#39;s an industrious thing to do.</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:08.770" style="s2"> It&#39;ll help you organize yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.770" end="00:52:11.560" style="s2"> I will post some relevant information later. I&#39;ll post something that&#39;s quite useful</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.560" end="00:52:14.770" style="s2"> Teach you how to write, especially a 1,000 word essay about how to write, especially a 1,000 word essay.</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.480" end="00:52:19.530" style="s2"> The deadline for essays is the day before the corresponding course. In a close, the essays are due one day before class.</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.530" end="00:52:21.030" style="s2"> At the end of the course I&#39;ll close, by the way,</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:25.160" style="s2"> Let me talk about who shouldn&#39;t take this course by telling you who shouldn&#39;t take this course. Okay?</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.700" end="00:52:28.450" style="s2"> First of all, if you didn&#39;t like this lecture,</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.450" end="00:52:29.950" style="s2"> Then don&#39;t take this course,</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.950" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2"> Because this is what the lectures</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:32.710" style="s2"> The same is going to be like.</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:35.540" style="s2"> They&#39;re not for everybody.</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.130" end="00:52:39.130" style="s2"> I use a lot of loose associations,</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.130" end="00:52:40.630" style="s2"> To elaborate the central idea and try to gather them back in.</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.630" end="00:52:42.340" style="s2"> I will walk around and I kind of wander around,</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.340" end="00:52:45.050" style="s2"> That way I can talk directly to you,</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.050" end="00:52:45.800" style="s2"> Which I like doing,</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.800" end="00:52:48.850" style="s2"> Of course I will sacrifice a certain amount of organization for that.</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.850" end="00:52:52.060" style="s2"> But my sense is that it&#39;s worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:56.650" style="s2"> The second thing is there&#39;s a lot of reading, a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.980" end="00:53:01.190" style="s2"> Many of them are hard science articles. And a lot of it is, I would say, a lot of it&#39;s hard science.</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.190" end="00:53:02.990" style="s2"> Especially the last half in particular.</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.990" end="00:53:04.780" style="s2"> But the first half of a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.780" end="00:53:06.370" style="s2"> Discussing philosophical in nature.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.370" end="00:53:08.330" style="s2"> Philosophical/psychological.</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.330" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2"> So if you&#39;re not interested in that,</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:13.410" style="s2"> For example, if you&#39;re a pure science type</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.410" end="00:53:17.000" style="s2"> Or not interested in clinical psychology and you&#39;re not interested in the clinical element</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.080" end="00:53:20.550" style="s2"> Unwilling to explore of personality, and in investigating</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.550" end="00:53:22.010" style="s2"> The philosophical underpinnings behind the clinical theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.010" end="00:53:23.630" style="s2"> Philosophy of those clinical theories,</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.630" end="00:53:25.720" style="s2"> You don&#39;t come, then I would say this isn&#39;t the course for you.</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.720" end="00:53:28.010" style="s2"> So you should take that seriously,</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.010" end="00:53:29.470" style="s2"> Because the readings are hard,</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.470" end="00:53:31.220" style="s2"> You need a lot of work for this course, there&#39;s a lot of work involved in this course</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.220" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2"> If you want to choose a course and it would be better if you took a course</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:35.230" style="s2"> It&#39;s better to choose the class that you actually want to take.</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.150" end="00:53:39.320" style="s2"> So welcome to Psychology 230,</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.320" end="00:53:40.690" style="s2"> We will see you later and we&#39;ll see you in a bit.</p>
