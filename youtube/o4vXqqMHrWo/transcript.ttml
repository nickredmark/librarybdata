<p begin="00:00:05.839" end="00:00:10.240" style="s2">for making time for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">um i actually thought this morning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.240" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">to the day that we first met</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:17.359" style="s2">um just down the road from here in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">little cafe um</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.359" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">two weeks after my daughter was born</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:23.840" style="s2">three years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">um so yeah it&#39;s interesting you were on</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:28.640" style="s2">a holiday in mallorca</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:30.640" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.640" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">this this series is a series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.640" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">conversations i&#39;m having with people</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">see in the larger field of what i call</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">the regeneration rising</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">um a global response to the converging</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">crises</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">um but also to the the potential that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">now have to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">we clearly know that exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">on a finite planet is impossible and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">clearly see</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">the impact of the system that no longer</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">um will give</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:03.520" style="s2">our children and children&#39;s children a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">livable future on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.520" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">and we see that everywhere people are um</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">responding to this and then for me this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">is this is a global movement that goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">um the practice of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">development it&#39;s it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">network of organizations some of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">have been around for 50 years some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">them have been set up in that last</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">five ten years that are now beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">um create a concerted</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">response and um so</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">what i normally invite people to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">my guests on the show is to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">their personal story a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">to to tell how they got into</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing um so i would love to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">hear rather than me introducing you and</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">of you you&#39;ve studied biology you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">studied</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">tropical ecology agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">environmental science</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s always better to have the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">from the person</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">him or herself oh thank you very much</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">a lot of people are trying to establish</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">um yeah my personal story is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">um starts when you wonder as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">uh some about something and that happens</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">uh you know we still have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">to to get these what i call magic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">moments in their life</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">and for me it was when i was very young</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">already nature although i was raised in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">amsterdam as an amsterdam city kid</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">nature was always around the corner and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">for me all those small creepy animals</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">that you could find you know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">small bushes in the city um where were</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">small miracles and that&#39;s where it all</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">started i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">because i brought all those animals back</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">back home put them in kind of terraria</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">to observe them although my mom and dad</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">were you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">a bit looking what is he doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">uh and that was and i think that period</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">framed me uh and later on that brought</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">me to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">you know to study biology and to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">biodiversity and the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">species and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">ecology is working and these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.120" style="s2">and i&#39;ve yeah i&#39;ve had experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">when when i was young as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">uh when these magical moments were very</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">powerful sometimes that you had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">an animal is speaking to you or a tree</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">maybe this sounds a bit weird but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">that give you the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">unity of whole wholeness and i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">wholeness feeling and experience never</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">i i kept it in a way i was able to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">maintain it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">also when i grew up uh in the puberty</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">times and later on</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">which is really not easy because i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">like going through at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">amsterdam a degree in biology and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">environmental science at the time um</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">i mean that must have been when did you</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">it it was in the 80s i finished my</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">studies in 87</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">1987. science was still pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">reductionist like i mean when i did</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">biology at edinburgh in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">the early 90s um i still remember some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">of the professors calling ecology the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">weird science</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">yeah not proper science yeah yeah and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">you know just so used right i studied of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">course i studied ecology and tropical</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">ecology vegetation science uh enactus</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">focused on not on animals but</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">on flora fauna flores and vegetation</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">and yes that was of course ridiculous i</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">mean it was all</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">part of the the big you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">i was able to go to nature and i was</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">able to stay in nature i</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">was doing these researches and and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">know all the things that were needed but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">still i was able to be there</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">in the most wonderful places and because</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">could take a sabbatical within my study</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">period which i did</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">at that time it was still possible so i</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">took off a year</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">and went to india and sri lanka and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">know because i wanted to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">tropics so i bought</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">the the cheapest stickers i could find</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">at that time it was to colombo</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">and um yeah and the new world opened up</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">and um and then i realized that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">i need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">i need to work and understand tropical</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">ecosystems because they</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">were the most diverse i could ever see</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">and have found in my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">i know that in advance but i didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">know you need to experience it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">and i think yeah i don&#39;t know i think i</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">able to to to do the scientific part</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">while maintaining the the miracle the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">wonder part</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">and and and keep that because that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">the real driver within myself to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">understand the scientific part</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">and and bringing those two together uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">because science did not always have an</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">answer or why a tree could speak to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">or whatever you know it&#39;s not speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s more you know you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">feel uh it&#39;s about the feeling of of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">the yeah the healing power of nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">on the other hand while the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">background is super important as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">to understand how ecosystems work what</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">species do you interact with</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">all kinds of species how does the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">colonization process</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">of reef works after uh you know a land</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">has been cleared</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">all these things are uh i was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">anxious now and still am</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">very anxious to understand how that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">works so science is is a very much a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">part of myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">ecological science agroscience because i</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">was very much interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.639" style="s2">in that world you know where aggro and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">was facing each other that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">the basis of my studies um</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">and yeah the real old growth forest and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">the virgin places that could re-energize</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">people i find it fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">like i because it so resonates with my</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">story of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">like i basically studied biology</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">and um worked on marine mammal ethology</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">behavioral science of marine mammals</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">and just got frustrated by um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">seeing and sensing so much complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">and then having to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">keep it to what i could put into</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">statistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">significant boxes and add a p-value to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">and anything else was anthropocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">anthropomorphism and whatever they would</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">would call it um projection and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">there was no way of including</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">this qualitative experience um</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">in the scientific discourse and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">that&#39;s why i initially left science and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">then did a masters in holistic science</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">because when i saw that there was this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">place at schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">college this new course that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">actually addressing all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">made me go away from science um it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">i immediately signed up for it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a rare but well maybe not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">rare maybe there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">biologists and life scientists who have</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">to hold this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">slight um well this is the schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">that in what some circles</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">where you where you talk hard science</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">you would get ostracized if you stop</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">talking about a tree</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">uh talking to you yeah oh but i never i</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">never talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">yeah i never talked about it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">was my world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">um but i observed it and i felt it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">i think that i think you know when i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">um you know i i had the i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">what happened but at a certain moment i</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">i was told by by an animal that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">that actually when i i i i can really</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">i remember that i was a kid i was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">young and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">eight years old and was walking in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">france and i think it was in italy with</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">my mid with my father</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">and there were some italians standing</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">around a snake that they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">kill</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">for me it was you know a wonder wow a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">snake beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">and i was looking in the icing of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">snake and that snake</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">was still not dead it was laying there</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">you know it was you know just a grass</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">snake</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">you know not a very anonymous animal not</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">and and i asked in myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">you know what are they doing to you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">immediately the answer of that snake</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">came back and they said they</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">are killing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">wow and at that moment it that was so</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.079" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">i really i certainly felt the unity in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">myself you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">i&#39;m the snake the snake is me those</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">italian people are the snake as well we</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">are all the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">but they don&#39;t know um because actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">they didn&#39;t know what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">feel such a and i have some other</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">experiences in this this way later on as</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">and and and if you feel that and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">nurture that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">and keep it then you know science is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">every is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">an additional great opportunity to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">system about how we about you know about</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">all the scientific things of biology</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">and i was you know consuming that all</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">and trying to get more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">reading all the books and getting more</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">understanding of all the plants and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">species and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">i wanted to know all the animal species</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">and with their latin names and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">because i because it didn&#39;t i did it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">yeah it was kind of a separate part</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">while this other</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">secret or or unity feeling was there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">actually it was so powerful it could not</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">move it couldn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t possible to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">get it away</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">and i was trying to go to places where i</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">could nurture both parts</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">the scientific parts with the species</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">in the lens out and that&#39;s what i did</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">so from 2000 to 2012 i was able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">actually to fulfill that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">dream and and i i remember signing it i</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">i remember when the board asked me i</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">said so this is the potential of irish</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">in the netherlands</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">and here are we now so give me 10 years</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">create this open up this potential with</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">funds with more members</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">with more influence with more</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">communication and dialogues also with</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">and yeah and that&#39;s what i did actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">this is this is what i</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">but i keep finding everywhere like</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this close</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">group of people working within</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">regenerative development</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">with with certain they have a very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">um clear frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">and the word potential is is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">um but then there are lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">naturally without necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">um knowing the the frameworks that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">um uh kara sanford and and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">particular the regenesis group and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">lineage of regeneration has</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">developed are actually working naturally</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">from that from understanding nested</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">wholeness from understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">the the the need for developmental</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">long-term evolutionary work</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">um and from starting from</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">starting from potential rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">problems and oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">i find it really interesting because one</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">of the amazing things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">i think make the approach the full</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">returns approach of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">common land which we&#39;ll get to in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">minute um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">unique is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">the conviction and the the audacity to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">clearly say from the beginning this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">going to take 20 25 years</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">um and not pretend anything else and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t know that you you also when</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">years basically like</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">this is going to take some time and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">good transformation need to be curated</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">over time patiently um</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">yeah now yeah i i i don&#39;t know how this</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">uh the potential there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">potential and in nature there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">your potential so i&#39;m an optimist as</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:29.679" style="s2">um if you see that potential of signs</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">of ngos you know more than a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.679" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">members working in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">the connection with the governments</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">because members there&#39;s all there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">also government members</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">and then the the you know the potential</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">that that you can have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">offer as a scientific based organization</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">with practical experience to to watch</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">the business</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">and get them on board on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">if you see that huge potential the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">question is how can you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">make sure that you can develop that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">potential while</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">you&#39;re also part of a let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">bureaucratic organization</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">and um the the great advantage of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:12.240" style="s2">national part of irish and was that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">was able know that that this this</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">i open up that space</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">and that was i think my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">challenge to open up that space make</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">sure that i was able to raise my</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">own funds our own funds without asking</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">funds from the swiss headquarters</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">but able would be able to add more</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">members internationally through</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">you know as through our grand mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">we could ask new</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">foundations in whatever countries to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">to become an asian member so actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">ended up after 10 years in more almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">200</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">extra new members local ngos for eisen</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">international</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">and and um when people but but it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a balancing act because you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">know you need to talk a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">so that people get an understanding yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">we&#39;re not competing we are adding value</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">to the network and the union</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">and that was my most yeah that was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">thing i was always worried about and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">tried to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">to do that again if i find that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">also a pattern that i i</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">see um</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">through observing your way of working</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">also in with common land that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">acknowledging that there can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">for different organizations as they come</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">together to do work to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">together actually to start competing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:32.880" style="s2">funding sources and for</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">competing for turf in what they</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.880" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">traditionally are doing and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">the trick is bringing everybody with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">vision that is long-term enough and big</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">enough and holistic enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">into a space where they understand that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">they can shift from competitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">advantage to collaborative advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">actually stay in doing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">doing well</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s great because then the others</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">don&#39;t need to do that but they can trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">somebody yeah but they can build</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">and more transformative together which</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">is the the collaborative advantage yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">i think you hear you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">hear you um and i i didn&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">at that time when i was doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">basically what you say yeah we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">creating a kind of a space</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">and within that space there was there</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">was space for organizations</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">to to work with to work raise funds</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">to do lobbying together based on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">different roles and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">and networks the different organizations</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">that people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">and um i think that&#39;s why i see</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">netherlands could grow</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">extensively because we could be we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">building both</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">the trust towards the dutch government</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">as well as</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">the international headquarters as as</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">we were bringing new energy to members</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">and bringing in new members as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">and you also i mean you you made very</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">good inroads with philanthropic money</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">around the world and were able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">through through ioc and funnel</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">a lot of funds into projects all over</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">the world he financed many projects in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">in south america and and another place</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">central america um yeah i mean but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">maybe two to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">to to bring the expectations a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">bit down it was small grants so</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">it was not a lot of money and i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">the overall budget was like 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">euros per year</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">so it it was not the hundreds and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">hundreds millions um</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">but but what i realized is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">small grants</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">are those seed money in institute for</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">grassroots organizations are essential</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">and if you can help them to move then</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">towards larger grants</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">uh from other institutions um you know i</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">think that&#39;s that was what our role at</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">that time and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">is and and still is i think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">this is this is also fascinating i</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to go there but you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">you made me think about when when i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">working with the team that had set up</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">the lush spring price um</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">the lush setup a few years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">and we were like they invited a team of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">12</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">judges to help them select who gets the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">prize</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re relatively small prizes</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">they&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">basically kind of in the range of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">from 10 to 25 000 so minuscule to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">compared to the big funding</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">but we realized very quickly that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">was such wealth</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">in all the organizations that had made</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">it into the runner-up stage had been</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">selected and bettered by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">pre-selection process and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">12 international judges and all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">judges were constantly saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:49.919" style="s2">we&#39;re looking 52 projects and really 49</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">or 48 of them should be funded</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.919" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">um but we can only give 11 prizes</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">and so so we started to explore could we</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">network with other prizes around the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">world and create a platform where all</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">these runner-ups are showcased</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">as wonderful projects that deserve um</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">funding and that have already been</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">vetted by a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">selection process and out of that group</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">this platform that is still</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">somewhat in development currently</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">looking for the next stage of funding</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">the re-generosity um</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">um and one of the central things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">you just made me think about is</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">precisely this problem that there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">lots of foundations out there</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">for whom 500 000 is a small ground</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">that on the board of directors meeting</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">get discussed just somebody says and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">then there&#39;s these five</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">projects that we also want to fund and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">they either just</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">sort of say okay or they they say no but</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">let&#39;s put that money somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">and but for many projects that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">very place source place based grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">sourced regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">getting 500 000 in one bulk might</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">already be</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">a bit too much to handle what they would</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">is 50 000 every year for 10 years to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">ready then maybe receive 500 000.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">here you point out a critical element</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what i took over in common land</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">if you want to bring change in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">landscape and quite often ngos want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:24.760" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">that because they see nasty situations</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.760" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">deforestations</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">whatever they want to bring change and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s it the charity world is focused</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">around results</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">and uh short-termism funding</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">which is it has its history you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">say or</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">until many of those vendors need to need</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">need to reply to their vendors where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">where the money will go</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">and whether the results are are achieved</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">but in difficult circumstances where all</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">those local ngos and indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">communities are working</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t predict you can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">how your money is spent and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">uh it will will will be achieved</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">so what you need to do actually is try</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">is try is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">to find the staff</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">so get the best people there local</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">make sure that they don&#39;t need to worry</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">about their salary</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">so that they can do their work well for</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">the long term</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">long run and what is the long run yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">our work is about decades</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">it is difficult but but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">plants or trees do do grow but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">grow faster because</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">because you put some pour some money</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">over it and and planting trees is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">i always say planting trees is the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">easy thing to do with getting the trees</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">mature</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">over let&#39;s say 100 years that is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">most difficult things to do i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">google and amazon can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">you know all those tech companies they</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">can&#39;t even do that we need to have good</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">in the field make sure that those trees</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">are not good</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">uh just as an example</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">so so um funding</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">of projects mean for filling of projects</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">it means that you need to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">the staff is well covered and that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">reliable trustful knowledgeable people</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">and human people human beings who can</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">who can where you can take away a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">bit of the worries of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">that they need to think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">fundraising every</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">six months because thinking about friend</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">racing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">sucks so much energy basically that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">can&#39;t do your work</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">and you are hired to do the work on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">ground with farmers with local</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">conservationists with indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">all those people living there to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">protect restore</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">and bring people together to transform</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">their vision and life into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">regenerative way of living and that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">so um that&#39;s why it&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">when i started commonland was that i</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">wanted to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">first build a strong organization with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">good staff</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">that don&#39;t need to worry every every</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">month about print raising</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">and then we can create a vehicle to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">with others</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">and and help them to to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">do whatever is needed at the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">i understand that at some point despite</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">of all your love and all all your</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">amazing service um</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">that you grew out of in the iuc and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">international union for the conservation</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">of nature i</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">i sense that you you you step beyond</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">conservation to regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">and the answer is it&#39;s now it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">i&#39;m still a conservationist and a very</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not that i stepped out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">conservation i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">i&#39;m still connected to i assume for</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">other organizations that work on</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">conservation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">we just celebrate at the moment uh the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">publication will be released next month</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">20 years of uh land acquisition funds</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">which i started in 2001 with lottery</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">at iucn so that is buying lands to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">conserve it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">locally with local or ngos of course and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">you know we i think we spent more or</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">less 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">over the last 20 years in tiny protected</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">that we could that we needed to buy</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">because that was the only way to protect</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">you know if you have some small endemic</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">species that live there</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">within a small water catchment or</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">rainforest area and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">the only way is to to to make sure you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">protect those species by buying that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">otherwise a mining company or an oil</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">pump company will consume it</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful tool um</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m very happy that that this fund</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">still continues</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">what i was getting with with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">conservation is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">even if you have a reserve like that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily fully protect it</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">no no so exactly so i&#39;m going to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">point exactly so so what my frustration</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">yeah but what i realized after so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">years working 17 years working with iucn</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">in the netherlands especially abroad</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">internationally</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">and funding a lot of projects that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">could indeed fund</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">let&#39;s say a thousand hectares projects</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">of rain</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">converting rain forest in let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">brazilian amazon</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">but then at a certain moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">that island of rainforests</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">it became an island of rainforest in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">soy belt</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">or in a palm oil belt because around it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">everything was cleared for monocultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">agricultural cropping or livestock or</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">and for me it was important to bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">together you know i&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">agriculture but i see</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">the danger of large monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">agricultural deserts</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">and and we need to weave these things</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">into a landscape approach and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">within irish and we always call that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">mosaic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">and the concept of mozi landscape was</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">built upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">what within our i should be called the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">ecosystem approach</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">and the ecosystem approach is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">wonderful document if you can find it on</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:28.990" style="s2">the web you should google it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">because it it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.990" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">written by people from isian in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">and it was accepted by the conventional</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">biological diversity in 1995</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">but it was a theoretical concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">and for me i always thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">that ecosystem report means people need</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">to live</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">within an ecosystem approach and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">we have the scientific parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">what an ecosystem approach is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">but now we need to make it practical but</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">because otherwise you you know it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work it stays within</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">international conventions</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">and and scientists can use it but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">know we need to live it actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">and when i had built that all that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">all those experiences within iucn with</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">grants and working with business and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">on and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">ngos at a certain time in 2010</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">and nine i realized i need i need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">need to go towards the next step for</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">myself and i probably cannot do this</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">next step within an institution like</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">iecn</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">but i didn&#39;t know that at that time for</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">me the moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">the the moment when i when my eyes were</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">opened was when i met john d liu</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">in 2009 at a conference in tahlberg in</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">sweden</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">and he gave a presentation and um he</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">showed his</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">beautiful footage of the lust plateau</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">and then and i immediately saw that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">list plateau actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">was implementing in a kind of a way the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">ecosystem approach</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">and i thought wow now i&#39;ve got finally</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">filmed and documented large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">an ecosystem approach so i went to him i</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">said listen guy</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know you you don&#39;t know me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">bill i&#39;m from the netherlands i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">heading out in the lance you&#39;re a john d</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">but we need to work together and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">without knowing it i said and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">work together for the rest of our life</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">all else is history yeah well i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">know the guy he didn&#39;t know me</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">and then we said together we were</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">talking almost for three days and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">the whole conference we forgot about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">conference and we were talking the whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">con you know talking for three days at</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">night because it didn&#39;t you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">in summertime in sweden</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">almost no night and um and that went to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">a collaboration so i hired john he came</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">working for us at that time with iucn</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">he was able to produce with my support</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">to our support</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">uh documentaries that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">everywhere like green gold and like</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">like a time of change in climate</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">uh bbc documentaries and so on so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">were teaming up together</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">uh because he could speak out and he</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">could communicate</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">that&#39;s this very well in his way of of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">and meanwhile it gave me the time to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">rethink</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">and also conclude at a certain moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">that i needed to leave aisha and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">need to take more time a sabbatical</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">which i did in 2012</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">to interview farmers and investors</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">because if we want to change this system</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">and build</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">the ecosystem approach into a economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">landscape approach um we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">onboard</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">all those external parties business</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">but you know always living there</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">and farmers they are living on the rural</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">countryside</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">and of course some other people but they</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">they are impacting that landscape in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">positive or a negative way</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">if it is in a negative way we consumers</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">through corporates and investors are</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">behind that because we want all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">things out of those landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">um so i went to those i took a year off</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">i actually asked i quit with my job and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">the next i remember the day you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">first you have a whole office business</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">secretaries and a pa and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">then the next day you&#39;re sitting alone</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">like here in my room</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">and i say okay um and my mailbox was</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">greatly going down</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">okay where am i what did i do had no</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">income had a kid and a family so it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">a bit scary</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">and risky but on the other hand it also</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">felt very much free</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m a little bit entrepreneurial you</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">know it felt like you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">now i can take the next step of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">this danger of you know no</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">income was becoming readily bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">bigger but they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">finally after a few months people came</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">to me and said how can i help you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">arrest some people with some</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">deeper pockets than i had and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">helped me to survive</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">which was wonderful so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">i was able to visit and travel a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">that period</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">and i asked farmers and investors</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">basically two questions so i went to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">london new york</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">frankfurt and amsterdam and spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">investors especially institutional</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">investors of pension funds</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">and i went to poor farmers and wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">farmers</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">in in the us in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">in europe france the netherlands</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">spain but also places like india ghana</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">south africa colombia ecuador so</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">several places turkey and i spoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">i met all those farmers and asked and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">investors and basically asking two</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">um the first question question was what</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">is your biggest frustration</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">and the second question is was what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">your dream</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">and almost all the farmers whether they</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">were poor or rich</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">it didn&#39;t matter uh answered on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">frustration</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">that the biggest frustration was that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">they could not hand over their land in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">better condition</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">as they have received it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">when i asked about their dreams their</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">dreams were where</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">in general that dreams where we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">and produce in a landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">is alive that is green</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">uh where people can live and come back</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t we the biggest you know their</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">dream was we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">that the people come back because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">were living in abandoned lands</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">quite often people were moving to cities</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">which is still</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">the big trend as you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">missed their you know communities</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">in spain schools were closed churches</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">were closed you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">swimming pool was closed so and only all</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">people were living there</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">so the community was number one and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">then the next though in their dream is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">give us a community back and then give</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">us a landscape back where we can produce</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">within an ecological setting so that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">don&#39;t harm the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">and we know how to do that but we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">not you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">uh financed to do that we&#39;re finding two</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">that was the farmer story that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">investment the investor story</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">uh you know i just summarized it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">so i spoke to people from our age and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">then they some of them were all that had</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">kids you know and puberty</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">kids in their puberty and and then our</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">twenties or thirties</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:25.520" style="s2">and when i asked the question about</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">frustration says that they said in</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.520" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">we are i&#39;m frustrated because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">investing</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">in destroying the future of my kids and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">my kids are telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">and blaming me for it but you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">got a big house two cars you know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">can&#39;t step out of this job</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s so they were actually they had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">crisis within</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">a generational crisis um and that was in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">2012</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">even before greater turnberg until i</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">came on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;re pointing this out and when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">when i was asking them about their dream</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">um it was more about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">their dream would be in their job first</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">of all it would be that they could</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">in the future of their kids but that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">means that their dream would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">that they could find pipeline of real</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">positive</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">sustainable projects but they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">find them</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.640" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">the projects that they were funded ever</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:24.760" style="s2">cold sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">where projects that were doing less harm</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.760" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">and and that was their so lack of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:34.319" style="s2">pipeline on the one side</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">and lack of funding to do good on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.319" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">other side at farmland level</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">those two things were connected of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">course and i thought how can i</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">build that bridge in a language that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">both farmers</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">ecologists as well as investors and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">business will understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">and that brought me back to simplify the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">whole discussion on ecological</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">degradation</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">simplify to one sentence and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">sentence is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">maximization of return on investment per</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">hectare</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">leads to degradation</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">because you know in every business</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">school and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">when i was in my sabbatical i became a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">fellow at the rotterdam school of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">management as well</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">so but every business school still is</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">realized in my discussions with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">investors and with the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">that the word return was critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">everyone is looking for a return</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">but what is a return when investors</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">speak about return they only mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">financial returns and they prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">speak in double digits</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">when the farmer speaks about return the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">first return he wanted was people</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">let the people come back the second one</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:32.800" style="s2">yes i would love to have some more</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">income of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.800" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">but sustainable income but i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">to get rid of my land because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:41.440" style="s2">holy that&#39;s my you know i</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">that&#39;s my whole history it&#39;s my land</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.440" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">and and generations before that so for</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">farmer land is super important which of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">and especially for indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">it&#39;s even much more important because</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">they have a longer history</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s tension with</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">colonists and so on but i won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:59.710" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">so return was critical the word return</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.710" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">so i decided you know if if that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">maximization of financial return per</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">hectare</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">is the real stuff simplified in one</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">then there are losses at the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">level but if you look into how many</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">losses there are there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">losses</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">and i brought it down to four losses</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">people who are living there lost their</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">sense of meaning and their pride</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what i noticed when i spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">farmers and i knew it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">already for for for decades when i spoke</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">to indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.319" style="s2">the second loss is that they lost their</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">community and they lost</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.319" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">because jobs were going away so they</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">lost jobs social capital</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">and the third loss was biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">you know the whole vegetation cover all</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">that had to do with biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">and species and the natural system and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">as a result of that the fourth loss at</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">the london is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">financial capital because at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">the system is so degraded that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">move away</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">that you can&#39;t do anything with those</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">wastelands anymore</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">no financial capital so those four</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">losses</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">are the basis of my you could say model</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">that i designed</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">to create a language model to build a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">bridge between all those different</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">and that was if we want to restore</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">based on an ecosystem approach the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">science underneath</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">then we need to talk about four returns</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">we need to return inspiration we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">social capital jobs we need to return</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">and that will give sustainable return</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">of financial capital or you could say no</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">return of sustainable financial capital</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">so that was the first layer of the model</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">and that but still theory because if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">explain it like you and you can put</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">indicators under those</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">different returns return of inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">is probably the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">but the most important one and you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">you can put a lot of indicators under</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what i did and i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">it now</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:14.839" style="s2">but to get it landed at the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">level you need to talk about landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">zoning</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">and that is where ecologists like you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">and me where you know understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">how zoning works and you need to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">first of all you need to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">an ecosystem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">so i was always approaching landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">from an ecosystem perspective it means</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">that you really</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re talking about thousands or</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">hundred thousands of hectares</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">because this is about a large landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">if you talk about uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">the ecosystem of the amazon there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">type of rainforests in the amazon basin</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">and you can see the amazon is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">area but if you look into it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">you can say okay there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a type of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">amazon forest between two river</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">catchments there</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">or tributaries of the amazon and if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">take that area it&#39;s maybe fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">or a hundred thousand or even</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">five hundred thousand hectares and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">these areas actually in a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">perspective you need to bring it back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">three zones</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">normally we bring it back to two zones</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">happens all over the world you have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">economic zone where people</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">are active land use mining agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">infrastructure cities buildings etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.000" style="s2">and you have what we call a protected</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.000" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">that is where we say okay their nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">should be more dominant in that place</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">and so we have a natural zone protected</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">or even still quite not protected but</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">it&#39;s still natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">but it may move into an economic zone</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">and you have an economics</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">town but the in-between zone is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">where the magic</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">can happen of course we need to protect</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">especially now in these days and yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">we understand the economic zone but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">in-between zone is almost</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">not present in most countries and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">call that we call that the combined zone</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s the place where you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">produce two things</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">you produce food and fibers</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">with agriculture and you produce</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">and if you do that well then you create</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">agricultural or regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">agroforestry systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">and we know that that this is possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">from you know a lot of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">nowadays in the regenerative agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">and permaculture we know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">but it means we need to have a change</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a mindset change but it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">fascinating how important mimetics and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">actually are in all of this because the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">classic</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">um ecologist language would call that a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">buffer zone</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">a buffer is is is a framing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">it common there&#39;s this and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">and we have something to keep them apart</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s um but the combined zone</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">is is the opposite it&#39;s it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">bridge building it&#39;s saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">we there is a way that we can um</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">increase bioproductivity and diversity</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">in this area</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">and still do it in a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">regeneratively harvest we</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">improve the landscape but we actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">get value out of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">and because we do that we create enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">financial return to the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">in the industrial zone in the in the um</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">the the economic zone but the economic</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">zone that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">that there is no reason to invade</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">the protected zone in in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">um happens all over the world where you</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">large nature reserves biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">reserves with</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">un labels on them and they&#39;re not worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">the paper that they&#39;re written on</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">um people have economic pressures and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">the reserve can&#39;t be enforced but if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">a combined zone that helps you to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">enforce the reserve</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">now that that&#39;s that&#39;s that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">true and i realized something else</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">that is the combined zone is</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:20.079" style="s2">um the combination is also</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">get now farmers get a better</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">understanding of what the natural zone</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">can provide for</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">can mean for them through the combined</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">zone because they&#39;re going to rethink</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">what this combination of biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">and productivity means</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">and for city people um of course they</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">know quite often</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">how important the natural zone is but</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">they have no idea what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">farmer</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">and and they can build a bridge to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">farmer</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">or to the conservationist or the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">indigenous uh community</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">so so um but you need to have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">and an ecosystem that covers that so</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s important that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">that you understand what a natural</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">is and where this mosaic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">setting or</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">three-zone setting uh can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">part of and that&#39;s why we when we</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">so so this is so so the four turns</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">is about measurements and uh the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:19.839" style="s2">opposite of the maximization of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">return on investment</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.839" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">idea the the three zones is how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">deliver the four returns within a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">and the last component is of course time</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">uh being so much frustrated about</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">of four years or three years of maximum</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">five years with</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">donors and so on i very much looked into</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">the large infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">world you know if you want to plan a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">high-speed train between</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">madrid and paris you can&#39;t do that in an</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">overnight</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">maybe in china they do it in a few years</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">but in europe it will take more years</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">in other places it will take a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">years so</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">um time is super important and here of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">the ecologists would say we need a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">decade we need</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">a century but the investor</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">who has been used working with large</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">infrastructural investments</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">dredging or building cities or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">will probably say no we need a decade</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">or two so i i brought in</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">two decades minimum so 20 years uh also</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">because that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">very much in tune with generational</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">so a generation and so i said okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">four returns are delivered by a three</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:40.400" style="s2">zone approach in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">minimum 20 years uh because then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.400" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">first of all you you can build trust</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">within a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">in 20 years you can&#39;t build trust with</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:49.920" style="s2">consultants and ngos if you have only a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">four years project</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.920" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">you can build relations that&#39;s right the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">building trust is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">and it can go away before you know it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">and and because these things are going</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">like that people come</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">and go in a landscape and um</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s how it all started so</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">what i did is i wrote it down</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">published it and asked my my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">from the ecological world from unep from</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">wwf from iucn</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">to to reflect on this document and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">and that happened in 2000 between 2013</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">and 14 and in 2015 the second document</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">was published with all those</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">people having looked at it at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">erasmus university the rocksman school</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">management and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">within the iucn commission on ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">management so that is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">the ecology the science scientists of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">ecologists within iucn</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">so i bought i brought those two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">together in one publication the business</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">world and the ecology scientists so</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">yeah that well it was not easy but it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">very fascinating to do i mean a link in</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">post this um conversation i will link</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">the freedom to test it so you need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">have the resources and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">let&#39;s say the legal constituency to do</p>

<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">foundation or ecosystem return</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">foundation but then we asked others to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">look at it and they said yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">such a difficult name no one will get it</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">you need to think about others as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">uh it turned in in mar i think in april</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">no in july 2014 we termed</p>

<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s grown so rapidly now you have</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">yeah luckily enough and that was only</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">possible because i found a co-founder</p>

<p begin="01:02:56.079" end="01:03:00.640" style="s2">so all that&#39;s how to bring them all</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.640" style="s2">together and work together</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.640" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">at a landscape skill and then work and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.640" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">identify landscape so i</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">i knew of course due to my background i</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">what kind of criteria you were you need</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:13.520" style="s2">to look at before starting a project at</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.520" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">you know within a concrete landscape and</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">decided to first start in countries that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.520" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">were less</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">difficult you know spain is less</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:25.839" style="s2">difficult than</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">southern sudan but southern sudan needs</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.839" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">a lot of ecological</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">restoration projects of course but if</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">you start there you know you probably it</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">will be more tough</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">and this is already is not easy so i</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">started to work in countries like</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">south africa spain and later on also in</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">the netherlands</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">could you explain a little bit um also</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">for my benefit of how</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">how to maybe um</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">ground the similar process maybe in</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:54.240" style="s2">collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">with with you and and common land here</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.240" end="01:03:57.839" style="s2">on majorca</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">the the actual process of engagement</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.839" end="01:04:03.039" style="s2">because the largest of those</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">um core pilot projects that the common</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.039" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">land has is the one in spain the alvara</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a million million</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">hectares yeah um a huge area in</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">most here um how do you i mean i know a</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">little bit you use a pro</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">um process u of theory eu approach to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">create um a multi-stakeholder</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">process of yeah now there are basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">yeah there are some steps you need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">take into consider look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">first of all there&#39;s so many places over</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">the world that are degraded you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.400" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">we are talking about two billion</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.640" style="s2">hectares you know double the size of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">china that is degraded and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.640" end="01:04:45.200" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">much more and it&#39;s going fast so there</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:49.599" style="s2">are lots of opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:51.359" style="s2">everywhere you can do this everywhere um</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.599" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve realized by the way now after seven</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.359" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">years of testing and building the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">that the four returns three zone</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2">approach works everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">uh to my actually to my surprise also in</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.000" end="01:05:04.000" style="s2">marine areas</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s an ecosystem approach</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.000" end="01:05:07.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">practical translation of the of the of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.920" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">this beautiful ecosystem approach</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">this is precisely where i want to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">about my yoga because</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:19.039" style="s2">the lyrics have the marine terrestri</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">so exactly so so for instance we also</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.039" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">work together with the charles darwin</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.559" end="01:05:26.000" style="s2">foundation and the gala on the galapagos</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">which is a similar way of you know like</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.000" end="01:05:29.839" style="s2">if you talk about an island situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">but so some steps</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.839" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">um if in some criteria so yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">uh it&#39;s easier to work in in better</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:40.720" style="s2">covenants countries than in</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">weak countries less stable countries but</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:46.240" style="s2">but it can it can be done everywhere um</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">i think the business drivers need to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.240" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">clear so what kind of agriculture or or</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">land use activities are there and are</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:55.200" style="s2">there potential to transform that from</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">the destructive agriculture to more</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.200" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">regenerative and positive agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s important and if there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">a potential like the almonds in spain</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:06.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s easy to not not easy but</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">it is still easier to transform an</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.960" end="01:06:11.359" style="s2">almond monoculture into an agroforestry</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.359" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">than than something that&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">there or cereals into</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:20.880" style="s2">so the the very important also is are</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">there people who live there</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.880" end="01:06:27.200" style="s2">want to stay there and really are open</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:27.599" style="s2">for change and have the leadership guts</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.200" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">skills to do that we very much carefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">look to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.880" style="s2">this that could be an ngo it could be</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">you know but but</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.880" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">people&#39;s kind of breeding ground of</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">understand this and are open for change</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">what i also realize is that crisis is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">important the the more severe the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.640" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">is at the landscape scale the easier</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">people are want to transform</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">and change um and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:06:58.480" style="s2">ecological conditions</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">you know um we can talk at length</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.480" end="01:07:02.880" style="s2">by the altitude in spain but you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">from an ecological perspective it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.880" end="01:07:07.119" style="s2">pretty difficult because</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:09.039" style="s2">the trees are not going growing fast you</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.039" end="01:07:13.039" style="s2">you have a cold winter and a hot summer</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">so the growing seasons are actually only</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.039" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">in spring</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:18.559" style="s2">and in autumn while for instance in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">tropical wet system</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.559" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">you have a almost a growing season all</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">year round</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.000" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">and you see the difference much faster</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">and then within a few years you can you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:30.799" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:32.400" style="s2">a secondary forest in a rainforest area</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:34.799" style="s2">if you have the right conditions</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">within a within two years you have you</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.799" end="01:07:39.599" style="s2">have meters of vegetation</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">so and that&#39;s definitely not the case in</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.599" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">spain</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">so so all these things you need to take</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">into consideration and then you have of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">course the policies</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:50.720" style="s2">that are available and the potential</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">offenders that might be interested</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.720" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">in these places so you need to look into</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:55.599" style="s2">all these different layers before you</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.640" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">take the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.599" end="01:07:59.520" style="s2">the decision to work there but number</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:01.599" style="s2">one are the people</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.520" end="01:08:02.960" style="s2">you know if you have a core group of</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">good people who really want</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.960" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">to work on this for decades</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.119" end="01:08:10.319" style="s2">then then you have you have something</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:13.839" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.319" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">very very powerful three years ago when</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">when when we</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">met on your holiday here in mallorca and</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">we already</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:22.000" style="s2">sort of started a conversation about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.000" end="01:08:25.199" style="s2">in both majorca and the balearic islands</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.199" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">with this a lot of international global</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">a lot of people know these islands come</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">here regularly on holiday or even have</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">second homes here</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">um it&#39;s a unique opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">to look at the combination between how</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.239" end="01:08:45.520" style="s2">does terrestrial</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:49.199" style="s2">regeneration and restoration um</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.520" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">connect with the marine restoration</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.199" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">that needs to happen and how are they</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">actually because</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:56.080" style="s2">traditionally you get the blue</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">conservationists and the green</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.080" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">conservationists and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:01.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t really um look at how they</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">work together</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.440" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">and then we already spoke about the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:08.480" style="s2">dramontana and some of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">landowners that that could potentially</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.480" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">be interested and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">things have moved on a lot and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">definitely all the conditions you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">just named</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">like um the big industry that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">listening three years ago is tourism</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">because they were still making</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">huge amounts of money but then you said</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:25.359" style="s2">you need a crisis</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">both at an economic and a landscape</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.359" end="01:09:29.040" style="s2">level and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">tourism pushed the crisis at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.040" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">landscape level in terms of rapid</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">degeneration of the island</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">and the the sea and now kovit has pushed</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">another enormous economic um crisis</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.239" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">where both political and business</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">players probably while they have less</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">to support a transition at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">in panic of um they have certainly a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">more willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">talk about a transformation and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">then there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">particularly in the marine area there</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">are lots of organizations that have</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">already set up and doing wonderful work</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:07.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">it actually needs what common land</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.520" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">and you yourself are so skilled in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing them together</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">and and doing this um when we were</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">talking about that uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">and you know the grating of an island in</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">this case majorca is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">i easily identify the zoning</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">so so with the zoning the storytelling</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:30.239" style="s2">also starts</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">so so this is first of all you need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.239" end="01:10:32.960" style="s2">how to bring together all those</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">different opinions and people</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.960" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">uh you know one lives in a mountain the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">other one in the city or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">uh you need to to tell you need to bring</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">them together at the landscape level and</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">tell them and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:46.400" style="s2">and create that story together and what</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">what our experiences</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.400" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">is that these four turns three zones and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">20 years helps</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">there is a very powerful tool to help to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:56.960" style="s2">give them a sense of place where am i</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:10:58.400" style="s2">what am i doing here</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.960" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">how is that connected to that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.400" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">mountaintop over there</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s a very powerful tool and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:06.320" style="s2">second thing is because these</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.320" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">you start with inspiration and start</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.320" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">again to question</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">what do you what is your frustration and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">what is your dream and if you ask that</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">question to those different people in</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">bring them together in a circle</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">and we use the the the theory you model</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">developed by the presenting institute</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">you know you create a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">real powerful understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">of them together but also what it means</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">for them to live in that specific</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.360" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">landscape and how these landscapes are</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">interconnected</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">and if you can bring that to the next</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.520" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">creating a story of in this case of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">majorca</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">where you say okay in mallorca we have</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">these three zones</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:51.040" style="s2">and we we have uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:53.040" style="s2">the potential of the combined zone which</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.040" end="01:11:54.640" style="s2">is not yet very much developed</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.040" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">and we had the potential of the natural</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.640" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">zone that could be more protected and</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">nurtured or whatever and we have the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">potential of the economic zone</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:04.719" style="s2">that was first of all driven by tourism</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">but without tourism we need to look into</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.719" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">other opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">you know what does that mean and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:13.280" style="s2">you start to create</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">um to build in uh let&#39;s say community</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.280" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">business thinking but underneath</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.840" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">before you know what you start to talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">about all about ecology</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">and about what is the ecological</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">foundation to make this happen and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:32.080" style="s2">you will realize that of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:33.199" style="s2">agriculture or the marine area are</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.080" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">interconnected</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.199" end="01:12:37.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to have the polluted</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">water and erosion stuff into the water</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">so it is a it&#39;s just a powerful tool and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:47.120" style="s2">and without knowing it sometimes it</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">sometimes really goes fast like in spain</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.120" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">people start to think about but if this</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.199" end="01:12:52.320" style="s2">is the case</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">then my business actually should turn</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.320" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">into another type of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:58.000" style="s2">business or maybe tweak it a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">you know use less pesticides</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.000" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">uh don&#39;t clove or till too much all</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:04.080" style="s2">these things are gradually happening</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:05.040" style="s2">because people start to talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.080" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.040" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">yeah within a few years and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:09.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in all those places where we</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.679" end="01:13:12.719" style="s2">farmers are going to stock with each</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:15.920" style="s2">other and ask</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.719" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">others for advice how they do things so</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.920" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">a conventional farmer is going to start</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">to start to talk with the organic farm</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">and say hey</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">i thought you were crazy but maybe uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">you are doing things that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">interesting for me to know and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:30.320" style="s2">that conventional farmer don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">be turned immediately into an organic</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.320" end="01:13:34.400" style="s2">farmer</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:37.600" style="s2">but he can already deal with some things</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.400" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">or and that&#39;s what we see everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.600" end="01:13:40.960" style="s2">so we are not promoting organic farming</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">but we promote</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">an understanding of what ecology means</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">and if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">start to farm with nature what will that</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:52.000" style="s2">mean for your business</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">but also for yourself there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.000" end="01:13:57.360" style="s2">another box opens and uh i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">talking with farmers in australia or in</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.360" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">spain with us and south africa you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:04.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">the meaningfulness comes back people</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.320" end="01:14:07.920" style="s2">farmers immediately actually they</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">understand what is good</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.920" end="01:14:12.080" style="s2">or bad for their soil and if they are</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">forced into</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.080" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">you know because of we consumers buy</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:18.239" style="s2">cheap things</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">or agro tech companies sell them</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.239" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:22.159" style="s2">they&#39;re at their recipes if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">forced into a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.159" end="01:14:28.239" style="s2">way of dealing things then they tend</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:28.719" style="s2">to forget what it is to be reconnected</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">soil life or um or</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">a beautiful landscape or a cow under</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:40.719" style="s2">the shade of a tree instead of uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">other times you know so so it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.719" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">it really taps into the soul of people</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:49.840" style="s2">and and that&#39;s where the i call it the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:52.640" style="s2">soil soul connection comes from</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.840" end="01:14:53.360" style="s2">uh we all come from the soil of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.640" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.360" end="01:14:56.480" style="s2">if you understand how evolution works</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">but but</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.480" end="01:15:01.199" style="s2">um it&#39;s good to be to find that</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">connection again</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.199" end="01:15:06.719" style="s2">and that is a powerful driver i remember</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:09.679" style="s2">talking to an australian farmer</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.719" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">i think it was last year it was a family</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.679" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">a wife</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:14.960" style="s2">and a man and they changed from</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:17.360" style="s2">conventional farming</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.960" end="01:15:19.120" style="s2">through organic farming on their way to</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.360" end="01:15:21.440" style="s2">regenerative farming</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.120" end="01:15:22.640" style="s2">and of course they went through a whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.440" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">lot of steps</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.640" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">and i i don&#39;t know whether they were</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:29.600" style="s2">certified or not but</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:31.679" style="s2">i i remember that the farmer said yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:33.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s so difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.679" end="01:15:36.480" style="s2">how all these ecological stuff works but</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:37.280" style="s2">every time i&#39;m i&#39;m just discovering new</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.480" end="01:15:39.199" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.280" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">and that makes me happy and i&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.199" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">go out to other farmers and speak online</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">and whatever to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">learn how it works but it never stops</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">and then his wife said yeah it i see him</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:50.960" style="s2">so make it makes me happy to see him</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">happy</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.960" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">with all these new developments and we</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:58.000" style="s2">feel that it&#39;s cleaner and we have</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.120" end="01:15:59.199" style="s2">almost less chemical stuff but i also</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.000" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">need to say some</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.199" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">something that i don&#39;t like of organic</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">farming and regenerative farming</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">and and that is we cannot plan our</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:11.360" style="s2">holidays again</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:13.040" style="s2">because the recipe farming is gone but</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.360" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">the nice thing of recipe farming is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.040" end="01:16:15.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">we knew the whole we knew in advance for</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.840" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">a whole year</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">how the year would look like and now uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.760" end="01:16:22.400" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know whether we can go for</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:24.320" style="s2">a holiday because</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.400" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">maybe this organic stuff will develop in</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.320" end="01:16:27.520" style="s2">something that we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:29.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s for me as a wife it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.520" end="01:16:31.840" style="s2">difficult so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.360" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">it&#39;s nice how these things immediately</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">have an impact on lives of people but in</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:38.400" style="s2">general it is positive</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.840" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">and now i think the markets and we as</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.400" end="01:16:42.400" style="s2">consumers need to make sure that this</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.400" style="s2">and all i also hope with the carbon</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.400" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">prices that this will be driven into a</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.400" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">new way of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:52.480" style="s2">living that will enable us to create</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:54.880" style="s2">and and restore landscapes</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.480" end="01:16:56.080" style="s2">and bring ecology back in our mindset as</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.880" end="01:16:59.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.080" end="01:17:02.239" style="s2">from you i mean because</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.280" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">comet land has grown rapidly and more</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.239" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">and more partners are coming</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">online in in large um</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:11.199" style="s2">landscape projects in the global south</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.199" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">um i&#39;m sometimes wondering is mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">and just a few small balearic islands</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">with their</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">um relatively small surface area</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:24.080" style="s2">um still an interesting project to</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">commonland</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.080" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">to engage with i mean for for me what i</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">see so</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">such a huge potential here is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:32.640" style="s2">this close connection between land and</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">sea</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">and the the project of with the local</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:40.000" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">and also investigating um</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.000" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">the climate change dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.320" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">the four main mediterranean climate</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:50.800" style="s2">zones</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">um very dry slightly more humid that</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.800" end="01:17:54.640" style="s2">there&#39;s roughly four</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">groins on the mediterranean and we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.640" end="01:17:58.159" style="s2">them all on the island because of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:18:00.640" style="s2">mountains and the diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.159" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">mallorca and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.640" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">transferable</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:06.159" style="s2">knowledge that and also it being islands</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:07.600" style="s2">what i&#39;ve realized living on this island</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.159" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">now for 10 years is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.600" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a an identity that is cross</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.239" end="01:18:14.239" style="s2">nationalities that that unites the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">mediterranean basin</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.239" end="01:18:18.719" style="s2">across the islands because for thousands</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:21.360" style="s2">of years the people on the island</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.719" end="01:18:22.640" style="s2">are they might the islands belong to a</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.360" end="01:18:24.840" style="s2">nation</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.640" end="01:18:26.000" style="s2">but the people on the islands are the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">seafarers</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">the the are the sons and daughters or</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:32.880" style="s2">grandchildren of of people who have done</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:34.719" style="s2">the interchange between all those</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.880" end="01:18:37.199" style="s2">nations along the mediterranean so</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.719" end="01:18:38.560" style="s2">so a new york genetically has just as</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.199" end="01:18:41.040" style="s2">much relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.560" end="01:18:42.080" style="s2">somebody on sardinia on corsica or</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.040" end="01:18:45.440" style="s2">actually more</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.080" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">than to somebody in madrid um and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.440" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">so so there&#39;s this potential that if we</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.920" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:54.000" style="s2">an example of long-term landscape</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:57.840" style="s2">regeneration combining marine</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.000" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">and terrestrial um on the balearics</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.840" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">that that could travel along the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">mediterranean basin and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:05.600" style="s2">if if there&#39;s a lot of research in in</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.600" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">climate resilience and adaptation over</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">the long term</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">and biomaterials research in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:15.760" style="s2">combined zone of okay if we</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:16.400" style="s2">we create create productive ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.760" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.400" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">are the the um oil seed fruits</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:24.560" style="s2">trees and so on that that we can use to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">create the plastics of the future and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:28.640" style="s2">on and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:29.440" style="s2">um all of that is then also relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.640" end="01:19:31.199" style="s2">the entire</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:33.840" style="s2">mediterranean climate zone which</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.199" end="01:19:36.719" style="s2">includes parts of australia south africa</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.840" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">california and so so i i feel it has</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.719" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">significance as a research</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:45.280" style="s2">lab um even if it doesn&#39;t add</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.239" end="01:19:47.120" style="s2">a big chunk off yeah i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.280" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">should always think in hectares you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.120" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">or trees</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.320" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">a number of trees i think the most</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">important thing is we need to think</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:56.400" style="s2">in ecological functionality and what a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:19:58.080" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.400" end="01:20:00.800" style="s2">restoring the ecological foundation and</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.080" end="01:20:02.480" style="s2">what what a majorca or the balearic</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.800" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">islands like other</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.480" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">archipelagos can mean is that they can</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">inspire others and um uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:12.560" style="s2">you know as common lands from a common</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">perspective yes we want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.560" end="01:20:15.840" style="s2">we we don&#39;t want to grow as an office or</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.840" end="01:20:19.280" style="s2">lots of people we don&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">super big bingo</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.280" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">a multinational ngo or whatever but what</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:26.320" style="s2">we do is want</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:28.880" style="s2">we want others to help to use these for</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.320" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">to to use the fortunes methodology</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:33.600" style="s2">so so yes we you know our if you really</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">ask what is my dream then it would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.600" end="01:20:37.040" style="s2">how can these four turns become the new</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:40.159" style="s2">norm</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.040" end="01:20:40.719" style="s2">instead of and remove that maximization</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.159" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">of return</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.719" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">investment per hectare norm how can we</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.080" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">make sure that this becomes the new norm</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">accepted by government so that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">will use it and it&#39;s open source you</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">know and you may use it you may name it</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">with a different name it&#39;s always good</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">to have a kind of a branded name because</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">that people will</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">recognize it easier but it works</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:03.920" style="s2">and there are and yeah there are several</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">steps behind it</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">and and it starts in your case in</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:10.719" style="s2">majorca it starts</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:13.040" style="s2">with telling that story make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.719" end="01:21:15.280" style="s2">that this or writing it down or publish</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.040" end="01:21:17.199" style="s2">it or making it known</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s very inspirational and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.199" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">you can peel it off</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:24.000" style="s2">in working level steps in activities</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">and then you will see of course that</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:28.159" style="s2">some steps are easy some steps are very</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">difficult will take years</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.159" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">and other steps you just go before you</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:34.480" style="s2">know it so um</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">but we have now built those experiences</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.480" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">at covalent in four landscapes and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:38.639" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:40.000" style="s2">working in eight landscapes now and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:42.880" style="s2">is and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.000" end="01:21:45.120" style="s2">are now already bringing on board other</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.880" end="01:21:46.880" style="s2">landscapes as we are talking to you also</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.120" end="01:21:47.679" style="s2">and others in other countries in</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.880" end="01:21:51.440" style="s2">colombia</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.679" end="01:21:55.440" style="s2">in brazil and so on</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.440" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">um and what we increasingly see is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:21:59.920" style="s2">with this methodology we can help to</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">build always build that movement</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.920" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">we are partnering with other</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.360" end="01:22:04.800" style="s2">international organizations to build</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:08.320" style="s2">that movement</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.800" end="01:22:10.080" style="s2">and um and yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.320" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">the great thing of this time is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.080" end="01:22:15.040" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:16.880" style="s2">there will be carbon funding potential</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.040" end="01:22:18.320" style="s2">becoming available it will be it will</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.880" end="01:22:20.000" style="s2">become available</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.320" end="01:22:22.960" style="s2">um and it can be it can be very much</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.000" end="01:22:24.800" style="s2">helpful as a tool not as a driver</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.960" end="01:22:26.080" style="s2">the driver should come from people and</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.800" end="01:22:27.760" style="s2">from ecology</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.080" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">and from regenerative agriculture and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.760" end="01:22:33.040" style="s2">these kinds of things carbon can help</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">as an extra income if carbon is the only</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.040" end="01:22:36.880" style="s2">driver then</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:38.800" style="s2">my worry is that we will get tree</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.880" end="01:22:41.520" style="s2">planting plantations</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.800" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">in the world where we should have other</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.520" end="01:22:45.920" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:50.080" style="s2">and that that can be not be the same as</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.920" end="01:22:52.239" style="s2">bringing ecology foundation back so um</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.080" end="01:22:53.360" style="s2">so i&#39;m very positive about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.239" end="01:22:56.080" style="s2">on now</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.360" end="01:22:57.840" style="s2">um uh in despite of co-fit and these</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:22:58.400" style="s2">kind of things this this might be very</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.840" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.400" end="01:23:02.560" style="s2">like in the case of majorca it can open</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:05.679" style="s2">up a new opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.560" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">in in landscaping uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.679" end="01:23:12.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m also very positive about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:12.960" style="s2">examples uh an island group like majorca</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.320" end="01:23:16.159" style="s2">can play</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.960" end="01:23:18.080" style="s2">for its for others uh like in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.159" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">mediterranean basin i mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.080" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">we all know that the mediterranean basin</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:23.600" style="s2">was all</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.360" end="01:23:25.600" style="s2">was forested before the romans started</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.600" end="01:23:28.000" style="s2">to deforest</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.600" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">and and uh and there were a lot of water</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.000" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">catchment all year round</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:32.719" style="s2">which is not the case anymore but</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:34.239" style="s2">already in spain we see that if you do</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.719" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">the right things you get water cats from</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.239" end="01:23:37.760" style="s2">the back</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re planting like planting trees</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.760" end="01:23:42.320" style="s2">planting vegetation is planting rain</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.760" end="01:23:43.600" style="s2">um yeah like that can you use the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.320" end="01:23:48.080" style="s2">species on the right place</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.600" end="01:23:51.440" style="s2">yeah the the um</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.080" end="01:23:54.239" style="s2">potentially he is really</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.440" end="01:23:55.440" style="s2">growing almost at a speed that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.239" end="01:23:57.440" style="s2">difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.440" end="01:23:59.280" style="s2">catch up with and there are more and</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.440" end="01:24:00.840" style="s2">more people coming into this this</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.280" end="01:24:03.280" style="s2">alliance that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.840" end="01:24:04.800" style="s2">um i i sent you this this proposal</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.280" end="01:24:06.719" style="s2">balearis vet that much</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.800" end="01:24:08.400" style="s2">my friend miguel ramos has started and</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.719" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">it starts with a million trees</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">and and some people like that hook</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:14.080" style="s2">because everybody&#39;s not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">how good it is to</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.080" end="01:24:18.320" style="s2">plant trees but it is much more com</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.320" end="01:24:19.040" style="s2">complex proposal that that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.320" end="01:24:20.719" style="s2">saying like</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.040" end="01:24:22.080" style="s2">any kind of trees it&#39;s it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.719" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.080" end="01:24:27.280" style="s2">um particularly paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">combined zone basically we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.280" end="01:24:33.000" style="s2">how can we</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:37.040" style="s2">turn degraded or even um</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.000" end="01:24:40.719" style="s2">non-aerated land um</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.040" end="01:24:43.920" style="s2">thailand into productive agroforestry</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.719" end="01:24:47.679" style="s2">ecosystems and and build the soil and</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.920" end="01:24:47.679" style="s2">but there&#39;s such a complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:51.600" style="s2">other aspects of this transformation</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.000" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">because majorca is so heavily</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.600" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">tourism focused it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:25:01.360" style="s2">yes there&#39;s all this exemplary</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.040" end="01:25:02.800" style="s2">ecosystems restoration and how to apply</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.360" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">the four returns but</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.800" end="01:25:05.840" style="s2">in the process of doing this here on</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:09.040" style="s2">majorca</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.840" end="01:25:11.520" style="s2">by by default one would also</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.040" end="01:25:13.280" style="s2">create a model for the reinvention of</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.520" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">the role of tourism in the future which</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.280" end="01:25:18.080" style="s2">of course now tourism is really</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:20.719" style="s2">interested in um like i</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:22.000" style="s2">only half a year ago before the corvette</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.719" end="01:25:24.560" style="s2">crisis started</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.000" end="01:25:26.320" style="s2">um i i started this conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.560" end="01:25:26.800" style="s2">what would regenerative tourism look</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.320" end="01:25:28.719" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.800" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">turning the problem into a solution how</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.719" end="01:25:32.480" style="s2">how could</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:33.280" style="s2">large tourism businesses get involved in</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.480" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">investing</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.280" end="01:25:38.159" style="s2">into the re-regionalization process that</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:40.320" style="s2">that incentivizes farmers to</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.159" end="01:25:41.440" style="s2">regenerate their land that that creates</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.320" end="01:25:43.679" style="s2">capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.440" end="01:25:44.639" style="s2">renewable energy production that looks</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.679" end="01:25:47.040" style="s2">at um</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.639" end="01:25:48.639" style="s2">bringing the transport infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.040" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">closer to home in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.639" end="01:25:52.320" style="s2">moving towards towards public transport</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:55.600" style="s2">driven by renewables</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.320" end="01:25:56.400" style="s2">and and also looking strategically over</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.600" end="01:25:58.639" style="s2">the long term</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.400" end="01:26:00.400" style="s2">as the tourism industry into how to</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.639" end="01:26:03.840" style="s2">diversify into</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.400" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">um a wider community-owned engagement</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.840" end="01:26:08.480" style="s2">so when tourism contracts they actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:10.960" style="s2">have helped</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.480" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">to build what comes in the future where</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.960" end="01:26:13.679" style="s2">there still is tourism but much more</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:15.840" style="s2">attractive</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.679" end="01:26:16.960" style="s2">and a much more diverse interlinking</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.840" end="01:26:19.199" style="s2">between how the</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.960" end="01:26:20.000" style="s2">tourism becomes the the to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.199" end="01:26:22.880" style="s2">the economic</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.000" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">engine of the transition yeah but that</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.880" end="01:26:25.920" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:28.239" style="s2">that is that&#39;s uh i think that you look</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.920" end="01:26:30.800" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s the right way of</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.239" end="01:26:33.120" style="s2">seeing it so you know i i&#39;m the last one</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.800" end="01:26:36.000" style="s2">who is against tourism as you may</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.120" end="01:26:36.719" style="s2">know through my history but you have all</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.000" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.719" end="01:26:43.280" style="s2">sorts of problems of tourism and</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.239" end="01:26:44.880" style="s2">as as in many things if this becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.280" end="01:26:48.400" style="s2">monoculture</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.880" end="01:26:51.520" style="s2">like in mallorca you are becoming</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.400" end="01:26:53.840" style="s2">vulnerable that&#39;s what happens now</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.520" end="01:26:55.760" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s basically same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.840" end="01:26:58.320" style="s2">monocultures in agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.760" end="01:27:00.800" style="s2">or other monocultures in economic</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.320" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">development you know a wise company</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.800" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">will have a lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:08.960" style="s2">you know a wise company will will have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.080" end="01:27:10.800" style="s2">set of</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.960" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">different niches in which that company</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.800" end="01:27:14.000" style="s2">is active</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:15.280" style="s2">i see it i see it for instance in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.000" end="01:27:18.800" style="s2">locomotive industry</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.280" end="01:27:20.560" style="s2">so companies who have shares in bicycles</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.800" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">are doing well and if they have shares</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.560" end="01:27:24.639" style="s2">in bicycles and cars you know the cars</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:28.320" style="s2">are going down the bicycles are going up</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.639" end="01:27:30.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.320" end="01:27:32.000" style="s2">so this is actually also a principle in</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.800" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">in ecology as you may</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.000" end="01:27:35.040" style="s2">know and the fur the species who</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:37.199" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.040" end="01:27:38.719" style="s2">who are becoming threatened are the very</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.199" end="01:27:39.520" style="s2">the species who are in a very narrow</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.719" end="01:27:41.760" style="s2">niche</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.520" end="01:27:42.800" style="s2">and the the the general species who can</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.760" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">survive everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">like rats are you know they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:51.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t care um and i think if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:52.400" style="s2">look at from that perspective you can</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.120" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.400" end="01:27:57.199" style="s2">tourism as a motive for change and still</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.600" end="01:27:59.760" style="s2">maintain a large part</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.199" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">in mallorca within the tourism sector</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.760" end="01:28:02.960" style="s2">because it will not go away and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have it go away because it</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.960" end="01:28:08.080" style="s2">can also be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:10.080" style="s2">spreading the word of what is it if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.080" end="01:28:11.760" style="s2">can you imagine if you tell this</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.080" end="01:28:13.280" style="s2">holistic story about this is our</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.760" end="01:28:14.480" style="s2">development plan for the coming decades</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.280" end="01:28:17.040" style="s2">for majorca</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.480" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">what does that mean for tourism well</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.040" end="01:28:19.360" style="s2">also also because of the knock-on effect</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:26.480" style="s2">so many of like the really big</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">spanish tourism enterprises that are</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.480" end="01:28:31.440" style="s2">global</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:33.600" style="s2">are all owned by mallorcan families</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.440" end="01:28:34.719" style="s2">and they and they now have that center</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.600" end="01:28:38.080" style="s2">of gravity</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.719" end="01:28:40.639" style="s2">in the caribbean in the philippines and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.080" end="01:28:42.719" style="s2">asia in lots of beautiful places</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.639" end="01:28:44.000" style="s2">also islands there you go many many</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.719" end="01:28:47.360" style="s2">islands and</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.000" end="01:28:49.679" style="s2">so whatever they would learn about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.360" end="01:28:51.760" style="s2">four returns approach and long-term</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.679" end="01:28:54.239" style="s2">transition over 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.760" end="01:28:54.960" style="s2">here on majorca they could immediately</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.239" end="01:28:57.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.960" end="01:28:58.159" style="s2">look into how they would then also</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.199" end="01:29:00.000" style="s2">engage with the</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.159" end="01:29:01.840" style="s2">the communities that they also have</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.000" end="01:29:04.800" style="s2">assets or businesses</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.840" end="01:29:06.159" style="s2">you know daniel it&#39;s um these things how</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.800" end="01:29:08.480" style="s2">to continue with this</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.159" end="01:29:09.360" style="s2">is is and that&#39;s i&#39;m just out of the box</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.480" end="01:29:11.120" style="s2">is is</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.360" end="01:29:12.719" style="s2">we need in a way you need to bring</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.120" end="01:29:15.199" style="s2">people together</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.719" end="01:29:16.400" style="s2">in a good environment and share these</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.199" end="01:29:18.560" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.400" end="01:29:20.000" style="s2">thinkings with presentations and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.560" end="01:29:20.880" style="s2">come up with the next step and the next</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.000" end="01:29:23.600" style="s2">step would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:24.000" style="s2">i think a kind of a first document where</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.600" end="01:29:26.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">sign and say yes this is actually the</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.000" end="01:29:29.760" style="s2">direction that where we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:31.600" style="s2">and the next step could be the first</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.760" end="01:29:33.840" style="s2">documents uh in in</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.600" end="01:29:35.040" style="s2">on zoning and then with nice maps and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.840" end="01:29:36.880" style="s2">see you know this is a future</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.040" end="01:29:39.440" style="s2">perspective the first drawing</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.880" end="01:29:40.480" style="s2">of what the future could be and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.440" end="01:29:42.800" style="s2">gradually</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.480" end="01:29:44.239" style="s2">you need to create a kind of a yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.800" end="01:29:46.639" style="s2">group of people</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.239" end="01:29:48.320" style="s2">uh who can do this in a professional way</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.639" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2">and are the anchor</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.320" end="01:29:51.600" style="s2">of change you know like alva laws the</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.400" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">anchor of change and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.600" end="01:29:55.360" style="s2">be indeed as common and we support them</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:29:56.639" style="s2">financially to make sure that they can</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.360" end="01:29:58.560" style="s2">continue their work</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.639" end="01:30:00.000" style="s2">because we know it&#39;s difficult this will</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.560" end="01:30:01.120" style="s2">this change will not come you know like</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.000" end="01:30:03.840" style="s2">this you need to have</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.120" end="01:30:04.320" style="s2">people who draw this further and are on</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.840" end="01:30:08.719" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.320" end="01:30:11.679" style="s2">on the potentials of of such an area</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.719" end="01:30:12.080" style="s2">so so do you you do you actually hold</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.679" end="01:30:14.400" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.080" end="01:30:15.199" style="s2">funds that are before the alvaro project</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.400" end="01:30:17.040" style="s2">and as they</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.199" end="01:30:18.480" style="s2">continue to do their work on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.040" end="01:30:20.159" style="s2">they did you say we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.480" end="01:30:22.639" style="s2">this phase now and now we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.159" end="01:30:23.600" style="s2">yeah so yeah so so our experiences so</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.639" end="01:30:27.280" style="s2">far is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.600" end="01:30:29.199" style="s2">if we really say yes to a new area</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.280" end="01:30:31.920" style="s2">so we have we have different uh maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.199" end="01:30:35.199" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen different s</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.920" end="01:30:38.639" style="s2">circles so we have a lower circle where</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.199" end="01:30:40.239" style="s2">we really want to we as common land</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.639" end="01:30:42.320" style="s2">would like to help driving this</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.239" end="01:30:44.239" style="s2">for the for the coming decades and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.320" end="01:30:45.840" style="s2">try to look for funding</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.239" end="01:30:47.840" style="s2">and then we have the middle scale</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.840" end="01:30:49.280" style="s2">landscape where that could be mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.840" end="01:30:51.920" style="s2">maybe will help you with</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.280" end="01:30:53.040" style="s2">all things we can do also to find</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.920" end="01:30:55.520" style="s2">funding but we</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.040" end="01:30:56.560" style="s2">cannot do too much and be too much</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.520" end="01:30:59.600" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.560" end="01:31:01.840" style="s2">and then we have an upper circle where</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.600" end="01:31:03.520" style="s2">we set up platforms to exchange</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.840" end="01:31:04.400" style="s2">experiences where all kind of type of</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.520" end="01:31:07.280" style="s2">landscape can</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.400" end="01:31:08.960" style="s2">tap into and and and use the tools that</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.280" end="01:31:10.560" style="s2">we have developed together</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.960" end="01:31:12.239" style="s2">and they can use the language so</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.560" end="01:31:14.880" style="s2">brazilian ngo can</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.239" end="01:31:16.639" style="s2">can tap into the platform say yes we</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.880" end="01:31:18.000" style="s2">want to develop our fortrans landscapes</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.639" end="01:31:20.400" style="s2">we use these tools and then we</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.000" end="01:31:21.679" style="s2">get the fortune&#39;s name and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.400" end="01:31:23.360" style="s2">and and they can use that</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.679" end="01:31:25.280" style="s2">also to raise funds because they have a</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.360" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">we create a common language together</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.280" end="01:31:29.520" style="s2">that investors and vendors and carbon</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.679" end="01:31:30.800" style="s2">emitters hopefully will understand at a</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.520" end="01:31:34.239" style="s2">certain moment</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.800" end="01:31:37.520" style="s2">and coming back to majorca if if</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.239" end="01:31:38.560" style="s2">um yeah or sorry to to our experiences</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.520" end="01:31:40.719" style="s2">so far he said it</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.560" end="01:31:43.280" style="s2">if we really do it well it cost more or</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.719" end="01:31:45.840" style="s2">less a half a million euros per year</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.280" end="01:31:46.400" style="s2">to develop to keep a local team up and</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.840" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">running</p>

<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:51.280" style="s2">basically and make sure business</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:54.159" style="s2">development happens</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.280" end="01:31:55.760" style="s2">to continue with small grants activities</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.159" end="01:31:57.199" style="s2">on the ground so that you can see</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.760" end="01:31:59.360" style="s2">already some change happening</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.199" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">and learning farmers between each other</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.360" end="01:32:03.280" style="s2">and then giving them seed money to stop</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.840" end="01:32:05.840" style="s2">tilling for instance or doing less</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.280" end="01:32:08.719" style="s2">stilling or whatever making shale swells</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.840" end="01:32:09.520" style="s2">and that that whole set of activities</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.719" end="01:32:12.560" style="s2">including</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.520" end="01:32:13.040" style="s2">the funding of this group of people this</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.560" end="01:32:14.719" style="s2">anchor</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.040" end="01:32:16.800" style="s2">is this group of people doing the theory</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.719" end="01:32:19.600" style="s2">you and so on will cost</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.800" end="01:32:20.239" style="s2">half a million per year so we ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.600" end="01:32:23.199" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.239" end="01:32:24.800" style="s2">have said okay if funders come to us we</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.199" end="01:32:26.960" style="s2">just say listen</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.800" end="01:32:29.199" style="s2">if you want to work with us this is how</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.960" end="01:32:31.199" style="s2">we work if you want to partner with us</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.199" end="01:32:33.840" style="s2">it costs you half a million euros per</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.199" end="01:32:34.400" style="s2">year for 20 years 10 million euro for 20</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.840" end="01:32:37.040" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.400" end="01:32:38.239" style="s2">and if you can assure or guarantee us</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.040" end="01:32:41.520" style="s2">that funding</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.239" end="01:32:44.080" style="s2">you know we really can take this up and</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.520" end="01:32:44.719" style="s2">uh we can guarantee you that that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.080" end="01:32:47.040" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.719" end="01:32:47.760" style="s2">that this transformation will take place</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.040" end="01:32:51.280" style="s2">but if they</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.760" end="01:32:54.960" style="s2">say yeah we have 50 000 and</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.280" end="01:32:56.960" style="s2">we we want a project we prefer to say</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.960" end="01:32:58.560" style="s2">okay you can go to that organization but</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.960" end="01:32:59.920" style="s2">we can&#39;t do it because we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.560" end="01:33:03.520" style="s2">believe in it</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.920" end="01:33:05.040" style="s2">you cannot transform things for 50 000</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.520" end="01:33:06.800" style="s2">at the large landscape scale</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.040" end="01:33:08.080" style="s2">you can do a project you can build a</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.800" end="01:33:11.040" style="s2">school you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.080" end="01:33:12.159" style="s2">support maybe a small regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.040" end="01:33:15.040" style="s2">farmer</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.159" end="01:33:16.480" style="s2">or company or or a local ngo to protect</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.040" end="01:33:17.040" style="s2">this water catchment and plant some</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.480" end="01:33:18.639" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.040" end="01:33:20.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what we mean with</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.639" end="01:33:22.560" style="s2">transformational change</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.080" end="01:33:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just another project and we want</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.560" end="01:33:25.040" style="s2">to enable that transformational change</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.480" end="01:33:27.679" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.040" end="01:33:29.120" style="s2">when funders come on board with 50 or</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.679" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">100 or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.120" end="01:33:32.560" style="s2">that we have the right place and can say</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:34.000" style="s2">yes 50 000</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.560" end="01:33:35.920" style="s2">that&#39;s great and that&#39;s what we do now</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.000" end="01:33:37.440" style="s2">in spain in spain we can say if fender</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.920" end="01:33:38.800" style="s2">comes or an investment say</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.440" end="01:33:41.120" style="s2">you have fifty thousand or a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.800" end="01:33:42.960" style="s2">thousand you say that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.120" end="01:33:44.480" style="s2">let&#39;s talk to avalon because i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.960" end="01:33:47.120" style="s2">within the big</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.480" end="01:33:48.880" style="s2">pistol in the pieces we lack this piece</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.120" end="01:33:52.159" style="s2">and that costs fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.880" end="01:33:54.239" style="s2">so if you put it in here it will benefit</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.159" end="01:33:55.840" style="s2">and if it&#39;s only a standalone project</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.239" end="01:33:58.960" style="s2">then it will probably</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.840" end="01:33:59.679" style="s2">will go on so so to for me to understand</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.960" end="01:34:01.760" style="s2">this better</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.679" end="01:34:03.280" style="s2">like as a how this could potentially</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.760" end="01:34:06.000" style="s2">work here on majorca</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.280" end="01:34:07.760" style="s2">this i completely agree it needs core</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.000" end="01:34:09.520" style="s2">funding for the team to hold this over a</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.760" end="01:34:12.000" style="s2">long period of time</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.520" end="01:34:13.600" style="s2">and also it gives that team the</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.000" end="01:34:15.120" style="s2">commitment that they can truly commit</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.600" end="01:34:15.600" style="s2">their lives to making this process</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.120" end="01:34:17.840" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.600" end="01:34:20.000" style="s2">if they have a long-term um commitment</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.840" end="01:34:23.280" style="s2">to to to their activity</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:26.480" style="s2">and but this half a million would</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.280" end="01:34:29.520" style="s2">basically land in common land</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.480" end="01:34:32.639" style="s2">but then benefit to most</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.520" end="01:34:34.800" style="s2">to the land yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.639" end="01:34:37.760" style="s2">so so how we work now with those four</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.800" end="01:34:40.159" style="s2">core core landscapes</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.760" end="01:34:42.400" style="s2">so we are funded as a team in common</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.159" end="01:34:46.000" style="s2">land that&#39;s separate</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.400" end="01:34:49.679" style="s2">and we have a separate budget line</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.000" end="01:34:50.639" style="s2">um for alvalo or south africa or</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.679" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.639" end="01:34:55.199" style="s2">which is four hundred thousand euros</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:34:57.199" style="s2">or five hundred thousand years it</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.199" end="01:34:57.920" style="s2">depends with further thousand years and</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.199" end="01:35:00.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.920" end="01:35:02.239" style="s2">is going directly to those local</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.560" end="01:35:03.760" style="s2">landscapes you&#39;re not in between you</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.239" end="01:35:05.760" style="s2">don&#39;t take anything out of it</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.760" end="01:35:07.280" style="s2">no percentages or whatever because we</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.760" end="01:35:09.440" style="s2">are offended</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.280" end="01:35:11.360" style="s2">but you are holding because sometimes as</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.440" end="01:35:13.440" style="s2">you build those local networks</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.360" end="01:35:15.280" style="s2">there might not be i mean i can think of</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.440" end="01:35:17.360" style="s2">a number of organizations</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.280" end="01:35:19.280" style="s2">that that have the track record here</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.360" end="01:35:21.040" style="s2">that they would give an investor the</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.280" end="01:35:21.679" style="s2">confidence i can put money into that</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.040" end="01:35:23.360" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.679" end="01:35:25.760" style="s2">but but you are offering the account as</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.360" end="01:35:28.560" style="s2">well no like at this moment yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.760" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">but we are i mean all the law is open to</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.560" end="01:35:32.719" style="s2">raise their own funds</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.639" end="01:35:33.920" style="s2">but people make sure that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.719" end="01:35:36.880" style="s2">need to worry about their</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.920" end="01:35:38.239" style="s2">cornerstone their their existence and</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.880" end="01:35:40.159" style="s2">they raise their own friends</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.239" end="01:35:42.080" style="s2">so we we have raised funds with all the</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.159" end="01:35:44.400" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.080" end="01:35:46.639" style="s2">to a care foundation for instance we</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.400" end="01:35:48.239" style="s2">have we brought them on board</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.639" end="01:35:49.760" style="s2">and they wanted to give the money to us</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.239" end="01:35:51.040" style="s2">and we said no no you don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.760" end="01:35:52.480" style="s2">in between</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.040" end="01:35:54.800" style="s2">you sign the contract directly with the</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.480" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">overall they&#39;re strong enough now</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.800" end="01:35:58.639" style="s2">at the time that they were not strong</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:36:00.239" style="s2">enough of course they they preferred</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.639" end="01:36:02.800" style="s2">to e-care foundation prefer to do it</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.239" end="01:36:03.520" style="s2">through us but as soon as the partner is</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.800" end="01:36:06.400" style="s2">strong enough</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.520" end="01:36:06.800" style="s2">you know why should we be there uh to to</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.400" end="01:36:08.800" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.800" end="01:36:10.480" style="s2">here but it&#39;s great to see that both as</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.800" end="01:36:12.880" style="s2">possible and totally of course</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.480" end="01:36:14.000" style="s2">is another huge potential here in</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.880" end="01:36:17.440" style="s2">mallorca yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.000" end="01:36:19.199" style="s2">yeah so certainly yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.440" end="01:36:21.280" style="s2">that would be another opportunity but</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.199" end="01:36:24.080" style="s2">the tour care foundation will not funds</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.280" end="01:36:25.760" style="s2">long-term processes but they will fund</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.080" end="01:36:29.520" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.760" end="01:36:32.159" style="s2">so so um it just depends you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.520" end="01:36:33.600" style="s2">for instance balance the dutch of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.159" end="01:36:37.040" style="s2">law you could say</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.600" end="01:36:38.880" style="s2">they started in 2016</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.040" end="01:36:40.960" style="s2">as a project cumberland project</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.880" end="01:36:42.639" style="s2">netherlands because the dutch government</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.960" end="01:36:43.520" style="s2">wanted to do something so we did the</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.639" end="01:36:46.639" style="s2">scouting</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.520" end="01:36:49.840" style="s2">we brought people on board and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.639" end="01:36:51.920" style="s2">in 2019 they became independent</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.840" end="01:36:53.440" style="s2">and and also with their independency as</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.920" end="01:36:56.960" style="s2">a legal entity</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.440" end="01:36:59.920" style="s2">all they found all the funding uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.960" end="01:37:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going from our account uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.920" end="01:37:02.800" style="s2">say the contracts</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.960" end="01:37:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;re moving from contract between</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.800" end="01:37:06.560" style="s2">common land and this and the funders</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.960" end="01:37:08.480" style="s2">to towards contracts directly with</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.560" end="01:37:11.920" style="s2">bangladesh but we still</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.480" end="01:37:13.840" style="s2">fund weyland as cumberland because to</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.920" end="01:37:16.880" style="s2">make sure that they can continue also</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.840" end="01:37:18.000" style="s2">when it goes wrong when they have no</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.880" end="01:37:19.440" style="s2">offenders</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.000" end="01:37:20.960" style="s2">and that means we need to make sure we</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.440" end="01:37:21.840" style="s2">get some extra funding from other</p>

<p begin="01:37:21.840" end="01:37:25.920" style="s2">to make sure we can do can keep up with</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.760" end="01:37:28.719" style="s2">this this process</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.920" end="01:37:29.600" style="s2">okay so so we need to probably have</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.719" end="01:37:32.400" style="s2">another call</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.600" end="01:37:34.960" style="s2">separate to this conversation to to</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.400" end="01:37:35.360" style="s2">discuss how we do the next um steps and</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.960" end="01:37:37.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.360" end="01:37:40.080" style="s2">in order to have a couple of minutes to</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.520" end="01:37:42.800" style="s2">to talk about concrete next steps um</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.080" end="01:37:43.440" style="s2">probably my colleague boss as well</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.800" end="01:37:45.360" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.440" end="01:37:47.440" style="s2">you know we have now a small group of</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.360" end="01:37:49.840" style="s2">people who they call it the nurture</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.440" end="01:37:51.760" style="s2">the the nursery where we nurture</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.840" end="01:37:52.400" style="s2">potential new projects that we can work</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.760" end="01:37:54.320" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.400" end="01:37:56.080" style="s2">and see how we can continue with them</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.320" end="01:37:58.080" style="s2">and you&#39;re in that nursery</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.080" end="01:37:59.520" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve already had a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.080" end="01:38:01.760" style="s2">conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.520" end="01:38:01.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.639" end="01:38:08.320" style="s2">great so thank you so much for this</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.719" end="01:38:09.280" style="s2">conversation i want to ask a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.320" end="01:38:11.199" style="s2">questions after the</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.280" end="01:38:12.960" style="s2">we stopped the recording but this has</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.199" end="01:38:14.400" style="s2">been wonderful and i i think that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.960" end="01:38:15.199" style="s2">be really inspirational to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.400" end="01:38:18.719" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.199" end="01:38:21.840" style="s2">um to to been talked through this both</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.719" end="01:38:23.840" style="s2">your journey um and how you how it</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.840" end="01:38:27.520" style="s2">made you arrive at the four returns and</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.840" end="01:38:29.760" style="s2">then it&#39;s quite remarkable to see the</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.520" end="01:38:30.560" style="s2">the uptake and how it functions</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.760" end="01:38:33.119" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.560" end="01:38:34.080" style="s2">well in very different contexts or</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.119" end="01:38:37.119" style="s2">already and it</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.080" end="01:38:40.239" style="s2">and and it is putting</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.119" end="01:38:43.440" style="s2">simple concepts that</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.239" end="01:38:44.960" style="s2">ecologists or permaculturists would have</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.440" end="01:38:46.800" style="s2">would feel familiar with but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.960" end="01:38:49.840" style="s2">putting it into a language</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.800" end="01:38:52.800" style="s2">that um a government official</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.840" end="01:38:53.679" style="s2">or an investor or a business person can</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.800" end="01:38:55.679" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.679" end="01:38:57.360" style="s2">also understand and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.679" end="01:38:59.679" style="s2">hugely powerful</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.360" end="01:39:00.880" style="s2">along with the the long-term commitment</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.679" end="01:39:03.280" style="s2">that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.880" end="01:39:04.639" style="s2">but unfortunately so many projects don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.280" end="01:39:05.760" style="s2">understand that if you don&#39;t commit in</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.639" end="01:39:06.480" style="s2">the long term you&#39;re wasting money</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.760" end="01:39:10.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.480" end="01:39:13.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s simply yeah thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.159" end="01:39:13.760" style="s2">it is as i said it&#39;s it&#39;s lovely to to</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.040" end="01:39:17.360" style="s2">speak with you</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.760" end="01:39:20.239" style="s2">and yeah um i think maybe in</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.360" end="01:39:20.880" style="s2">summarizing the lessons uh i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.239" end="01:39:24.080" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.880" end="01:39:25.840" style="s2">is that uh if you really work with this</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.080" end="01:39:28.480" style="s2">kind of approaches or holistic</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.840" end="01:39:30.639" style="s2">approaches the risks for investors</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.480" end="01:39:31.679" style="s2">as well as for governments will go down</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.639" end="01:39:35.040" style="s2">and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.679" end="01:39:38.320" style="s2">everyone wants to see risks go down</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.040" end="01:39:41.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s so difficult</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.320" end="01:39:45.119" style="s2">to understand that this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.840" end="01:39:47.760" style="s2">a risk return thing we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.119" end="01:39:49.360" style="s2">um but returns are multiple and the</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.760" end="01:39:52.239" style="s2">risks are also multiple</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.360" end="01:39:54.560" style="s2">but you know working with two entities</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.239" end="01:39:57.199" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.560" end="01:39:58.320" style="s2">how to say dynamic like ecology and</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.199" end="01:40:00.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.320" end="01:40:02.000" style="s2">um you know i think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.000" end="01:40:02.480" style="s2">difficult thing to do to work with these</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.000" end="01:40:05.840" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.480" end="01:40:06.639" style="s2">dynamic uh items or or i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.840" end="01:40:09.600" style="s2">you call it or</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.639" end="01:40:10.800" style="s2">entities and it&#39;s so challenging it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.600" end="01:40:14.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s beautiful and it</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.800" end="01:40:16.639" style="s2">yeah ultimately this is this will be</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.719" end="01:40:18.159" style="s2">part of a new way of of thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.639" end="01:40:20.880" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.159" end="01:40:22.880" style="s2">this beautifully ties our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.880" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">together because ultimately this working</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.880" end="01:40:28.560" style="s2">with ecology and working with people</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:31.119" style="s2">and if if we do it</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.560" end="01:40:32.400" style="s2">right from a holistic perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.119" end="01:40:34.639" style="s2">values science</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.400" end="01:40:36.080" style="s2">but also holds that magic and that</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.639" end="01:40:39.119" style="s2">connection to landscape</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.080" end="01:40:42.400" style="s2">and place that we started off with um</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.119" end="01:40:45.440" style="s2">then there&#39;s a healing of</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.400" end="01:40:46.480" style="s2">us learning to see that we are part of</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.440" end="01:40:49.040" style="s2">the ecology</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.480" end="01:40:50.880" style="s2">and which is the the the big rift that</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.040" end="01:40:53.760" style="s2">runs through our culture is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.880" end="01:40:55.280" style="s2">too many people still think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.760" end="01:40:57.440" style="s2">the environment out there and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.280" end="01:40:58.080" style="s2">human beings and culture and technology</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.440" end="01:41:00.719" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.080" end="01:41:01.679" style="s2">and to understand that that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.719" end="01:41:05.199" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.679" end="01:41:07.520" style="s2">one complex dynamic process nested</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.199" end="01:41:08.960" style="s2">from the local to the global is is</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.520" end="01:41:12.239" style="s2">really where we need to</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.960" end="01:41:14.639" style="s2">grow like that&#39;s the mature ration step</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.239" end="01:41:18.560" style="s2">of our species right now to make that</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.639" end="01:41:20.719" style="s2">yeah and and also to because it gives us</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.560" end="01:41:23.040" style="s2">also a better understanding how we can</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.719" end="01:41:25.920" style="s2">benefit from technology</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.040" end="01:41:27.760" style="s2">while not because technology can play a</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.920" end="01:41:30.480" style="s2">very important part in this but</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.760" end="01:41:32.960" style="s2">it should not be the driver of processes</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.480" end="01:41:35.280" style="s2">humans and ecology should be the driver</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.960" end="01:41:36.239" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s often the one one thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.280" end="01:41:37.440" style="s2">that i have</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.239" end="01:41:40.239" style="s2">spent a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.440" end="01:41:44.320" style="s2">lately is is that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.239" end="01:41:47.760" style="s2">on the one hand have a very</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.320" end="01:41:48.159" style="s2">much deeper conversation about ethics</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.760" end="01:41:51.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.159" end="01:41:52.080" style="s2">technology and what technologies to use</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.360" end="01:41:55.280" style="s2">when and</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.080" end="01:41:57.600" style="s2">which technologies to never use um</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.280" end="01:41:58.840" style="s2">but at the same time we also need to</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.600" end="01:42:02.639" style="s2">reposition</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.840" end="01:42:06.800" style="s2">technology as part of nature as like</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.639" end="01:42:09.600" style="s2">to understand that that if everything is</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.800" end="01:42:11.040" style="s2">natural to some extent our cities then</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.600" end="01:42:14.159" style="s2">also our technology</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.040" end="01:42:17.920" style="s2">is part of this biophysical process and</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.159" end="01:42:19.760" style="s2">and some technologies can be adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.920" end="01:42:21.440" style="s2">and generate abundance and other</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.760" end="01:42:24.400" style="s2">technologies are maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.440" end="01:42:24.880" style="s2">and will go extinct so in in that wider</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.400" end="01:42:26.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.880" end="01:42:28.320" style="s2">we just have to pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.840" end="01:42:30.880" style="s2">technologies um</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.320" end="01:42:31.760" style="s2">to use and and to revalue the</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.880" end="01:42:34.639" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.760" end="01:42:37.280" style="s2">of the natural world that they do</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.639" end="01:42:38.480" style="s2">complex regeneration work so much better</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.280" end="01:42:42.159" style="s2">than any</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.480" end="01:42:44.080" style="s2">um human made technology at this point</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.159" end="01:42:45.920" style="s2">can do alone so it&#39;s it&#39;s bringing them</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.080" end="01:42:49.440" style="s2">together yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.920" end="01:42:51.280" style="s2">wonderful yeah so we should go on but</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.440" end="01:42:54.719" style="s2">we&#39;ll stop now and have so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.280" end="01:42:54.719" style="s2">couple of minutes hold on</p>
