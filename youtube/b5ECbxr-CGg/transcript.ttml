<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">on what&#39;s happening today um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.640" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">i&#39;m super excited of having jordan here</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">and yeah there&#39;s so much going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">i feel like culture wars are heating up</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">again and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">happening in different agendas and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">the person that i was going to point to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">jordan hall and that&#39;s why we have him</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">here today</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m super excited for that um so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">yeah i wanted to pass it to jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">for another situational session um</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">or assessment uh the riot edition so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">jordan uh what is the situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">i&#39;m unmuted all right so um i noticed as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">i was thinking about this that there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">a desire to go down</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">into the details and then what i</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">realized was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">exactly the wrong approach the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">thing to do right now is to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">way up and even i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">anybody&#39;s read the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">original situational assessment 2017</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">document but to be thinking if you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">about the architecture of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">it described a series of fronts and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">it sort of talked at the bottom about</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">the deep basis of and sometimes what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">really going on like the deep driver</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">that&#39;s causing the various fronts to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">show up as they show up</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">um and i believe i call it the war of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">um so let me give that as the frame</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">because i think that&#39;s the best way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">grasping what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">before i get there i&#39;d like to give a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">visual metaphor that i feel this gives</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">you a really solid sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">so um if you&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">one of those stop-motion photographs of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">rotting corpse you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">rabbit or a mouse or something sitting</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">in the in the grass and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">begins to almost like vibrate and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">it up wells and then it suddenly just</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">disappears</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">um that&#39;s what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">now the the the thing that is is in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">of of decay is the coherence</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">that was constructed back in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">mid-century</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">which i named the church so the blue</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">church is dead and the blue church is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">the process of decay</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">and and that decay will show up as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">a a fractal war not a civil war</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">because the the basis for any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">conflict is is some level of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">right if</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">you have any conflict is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">between two kinds of beings some two</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">coherent organizations of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">right now the process the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">that the ability to even achieve any</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">level of coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">is falling so coherence is decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">across the entire field</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a continuous upwelling</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">of efforts to achieve some level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">coherence in that process</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">and then those forces end up engaging</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">with each other through all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">uh domains of conflict that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">happen so if you imagine a biological</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">and then imagine there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">structure like it&#39;s actually holding up</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">horse that&#39;s holding up a uh a weight</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">then you imagine the process of decay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">there are structural forces that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll see them move or fall</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">because the underlying coherence that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">had been supporting them that was part</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">of their underlying assumption that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">needed to have to function</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">is itself actually decaying and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">you&#39;ll see structural stuff move</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s very salient it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">very easy to see like a banking collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">like oh my gosh a banking collapse or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">you know buildings burning on the street</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually a surface effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">a big chunk of actual substructure</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">happening at the level of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">the coherent dynamic that is losing its</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">capacity to be a weight-bearing load</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">and but of course the superficial effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">is not meaningless it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">because it actually creates and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">accelerates</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">the other dynamics in the in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">system so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">at the end of the day we all we all</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">definitely care about bullets and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">buildings as much as we care about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">the subtle stuff that&#39;s going on but um</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">so if you can hold that metaphor i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">that that will help to help me get to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">level of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">to kind of recapitulate to to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">we&#39;re more or less in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">a shared space uh the the notion</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">is that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">you know since 75 000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">humans have been seeking by necessity</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">mechanisms of achieving a form of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">coherence and i&#39;ll explain a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">more like a simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">what i mean by that a form of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">that can satisfy three basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">uh one is that it can form a stable</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">interiority meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">it can actually hold itself as coherent</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">with some number of people it can have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">population that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">coherent together um</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">the second is that it can do so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">effectively in the context of nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">meaning that it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">effectively extract resources from</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">nature that can maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">the livingness of the various elements</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">of its of its</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">coherent humanness and then third is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">can maintain its stability vis-a-vis</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">other coherent groups of humans out in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">the world sometimes known as war</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">um and there&#39;s a you know been a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">continuous competitive evolution on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">particular landscape now for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">several tens of thousands of years and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">and each</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">phase of that work changes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">characteristics of what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">you know the innovation of certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">of technologies might</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">change the scope of the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">that could be actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">entrained under a different field of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">coherence so the invention of say mass</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">media and large long-scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">train ship and air aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">transportation</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">gives rise to the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">actually having something like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">the post-war nation state um</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">so coming into the the end of world war</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">ii we entered into the field of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">coherence that i called the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">and so that has a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">structural characteristics to it it has</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">the capacity and it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.759" style="s2">both as itself the the thing i call the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">blue church proper which is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.759" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">anglo-american specific version of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">of that form</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">as well as uh copies so the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">japanese structure is a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">different variation on the theme</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">and is also connected to the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">fundamental anglo-american structure</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">the german structure you know the eu has</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">a form kind of a variation of mutation</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">on that on that theme as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">so and that has a has advantages and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">disadvantages</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">the the advantage of a field of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">coherence is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">it more or less is able to exit</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">most of the forms of conflict that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">would see among</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">um sort of squabbling humans from its</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">interiority under the under the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">order and policing and by order what i</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">mean is people will choose to do things</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">like engage in transactions or just kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">of like yell at each other across the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">fence</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">rather than escalating into higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">levels of conflict and policing is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">when high levels of conflict do emerge</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">the in this case the state has the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:37.640" style="s2">capacity to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">asymmetric power to extinguish that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.640" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">conflict um</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">which of course has all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">slippage and disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">uh effects uh across the social field</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">but net net</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">um there&#39;s a uh a stability an inability</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">of any particular subset of groups to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">exit meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">or to defect catastrophically</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">and of course the disadvantages are that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">it has a particular distribution it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">a certain signature characteristic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">it creates a niche</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">it creates a an internal ecosystem that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">creates</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">um winners and losers of certain sorts</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">based upon</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">a wide variety of characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">have to have to do with the specifics of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">that particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">moment it&#39;s technological</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">characteristics it&#39;s historical</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">path dependencies its um even its</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">geographic</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">characteristics um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">we then move into a moment where the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">deep basis</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">the the primary mechanisms that maintain</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">the integrity</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">of that particular kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">that stuff starts to actually break down</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of three</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">primary reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">one is for example a change at the level</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">of techne</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">so the possibilities of technology shift</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">enough that the the things that had been</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">um both necessary and sufficient like</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">for example broadcast television&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">capacity to create a shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">um certainly find themselves no longer</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">necessary nor sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">the internet&#39;s capacity to decimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">that effort to create a controlled</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">shared metanarrative and generate a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">large number of micro narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">can now actually in fact out-compete the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">meta-narrative&#39;s efforts to create a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">here&#39;s the what&#39;s one story of what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">true so that&#39;s one example</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">and of course you can kind of identify</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">all the different vectors of technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">that exists you know pick your poison um</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">the second is uh uh corruption</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">of course which we&#39;re experiencing ad</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">nauseam so and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">in the context of corruption the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">metaphor of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">when you land at heathrow airport and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">how dirty it is and you see how</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">hard it is to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.839" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">well-functioning complicated systems</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">right this is atherosclerosis but what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">mean by corruption i don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">mean just</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">you know judges taking bribes or or</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">um or you have things like um</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">another example of obsolescence so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">one or more of those three</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">and the the old coherence begins to</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">and in in the meantime of course what</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">ends up happening is there becomes to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">a struggle</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">for the would be just the resources the</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">literally the human beings which is</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">um and the the productivity the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.880" style="s2">application of labor into new kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">that are now looking for a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">uh stability</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">so if you take that that whole story and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">you kind of look at the various lenses</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">that i provided in the situational</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that each one of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.240" style="s2">fronts was really just a lens at looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">at that story right so if you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.240" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">geopolitics geopolitics if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">that lens you can see oh okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">unconventional warfare metadynamic that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">the water right so where we&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">since mutually assured destruction push</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">conflict into the into the fractal level</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">um and of course that&#39;s ongoing right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">one of the things that is happening is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">that the the level of unconventional</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">warfare is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">escalating significantly right so to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">depict the folks that uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">that philip and i are apparently closely</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">related to china is very active</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">in unconventional warfare um</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">right now at a high level like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">much more so than they have been in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">in the recent past because</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">now is an opportunity space like lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">chaos is happening inside their</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">primary global um adversary</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">and and so nudging that through</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">traditional well</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">traditional and conventional is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">an odd paradox but through</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">unconventional warfare techniques</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">is happening you know full stop and by</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">the way it&#39;s not you know just china in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s by definition</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">every agent who has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">exercise power at the global</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">or at the geopolitical level is playing</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">that game</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">must play that game and must play that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">game at maximum speed right it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">total war</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">um and and so you can look at the at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">geopolitical level</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">and then you can zoom in and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at it inside what</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">ostensibly be the interiority of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">united states right where you see a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">power groups and power groups are power</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">groups so you&#39;ve got things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">the mob and you&#39;ve got things like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">the cartels that have presence of power</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">inside the united states you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">things like the fbi</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">inside the fbi you&#39;ve got probably five</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">to seven distinct groups that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">different levels of coordination</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">among them that have different alliances</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">with different meshes both interior and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">exterior to the law to the us milieu</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">some of which are highly corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">some substances the fbi that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">directly in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">alliance with the sinaloa cartels some</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">of which are less corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">that have maybe a direct alliance with</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">our political institutions that we would</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">like to actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">perceive as being both valid and useful</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">and those are in different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">unconventional warfare it&#39;s crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">recognize unconventional warfare is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">warfare where you want to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">maximum effect with maximum plausible</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">deniability</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">if you combine those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">you get the kind of the efficient</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">frontier so the second that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">pointed as being the agent</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">that is engaged in some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">hostility you&#39;ve lost that move</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">waste well that that phrase was echoed</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">in sort of like every center of power at</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">and of course what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">the the amount of chaos increases is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">everybody leaps forward to figure out</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">they&#39;ve been holding back um which of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">course breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">other kinds of structure right because</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">you know war has that has a high</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">in this particular case uh one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">places where the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">uh the energy spilled out was in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">context of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">civil society right so the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">kindling that we had seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">catch and burn a little bit catch and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">burn a little bit in the periods around</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">sort of 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">i think what like portland had a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">of charlotte</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">charlottesville had a couple like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">kind of kindling was out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">and again in some sense a random and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">predictable event</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">occurred that was created enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">uh energy to then catch the fuel that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">was in the ambient environment and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">spread through that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">modality and okay so then where are we</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">now what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">so now i&#39;m going to zoom down a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">bit to the particular modality that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">guys decided to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">code in this particular event the riots</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s very simple it</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">fizzles out or it escalates</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">um most likely it fizzles out which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">to say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">there&#39;s no particular place for that for</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">that energy to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">that is linear the notion of protest</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">like political protest like organizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">and marching and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">sort of shouting and carrying signs is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">fully captured political activity like</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">from the period of the 50s to the late</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">70s it was an innovation that had</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">maybe even earlier gandhi and whatnot um</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">but by the time you got to the early 80s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">it was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">impotent structure and then by the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">you get to the 90s it was in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">captured structure</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">so if i&#39;m in part part of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">blue church control mechanism what i</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">whenever i run into a a a political</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">competitor</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">is i want to push that energy into</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">protest right i want the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">the sort of anti-globalist protesters in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">seattle to kind of like do their thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">it allows that energy to be released in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">kind of like a barbaric yelp</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">but to actually be very dissipated it</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">converts a laser beam into a flashlight</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">and it enables the control scheme to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">continue to operate with sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">minimum</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">amount of necessary change which is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">little in fact mostly just a rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s not a whole lot of of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">practical effectiveness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">associated with the particular agenda</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">strategy or modality of protests and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">even less so obviously with riots</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">just very high random energy but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">high rate of energy</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">of course could catch fire to something</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">sideways</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">so most likely they they fizzle out</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">having changed things that they change</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">one area that i think is quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">and it should be looked at is the degree</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">what i would call or not what i would</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">call what the what those people will</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">call the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">the integral people coined a term called</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">the green mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">and the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">the exiting of consciousnesses from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">modalities the green meme</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">which is to say okay that thing is done</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">distributions of interpretation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">agenda</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">modes is no longer meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">effective therefore if i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">operating under that i will exit it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">so the exit of those who are entrained</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">to the green meme to someplace else</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">which i expect will probably be biased</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">simply being effective um is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">characteristics of what i think we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">expect to have happen uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">by the way the implications of that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">are complex like very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">predict exactly where that where that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">energy goes and what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">what the consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">which would then show up as escalation</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">um almost like a copycat</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">innovation so some new innovation shows</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">somewhat randomly but the innovation is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">a structural change</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">which then is perceived and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">generates a line of copying that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">follows</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">in evolutionary theory we call a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">ridgeline in a niche</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">an example i think that would be a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">concrete example would would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">imagine if you had sorry so three images</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">that i&#39;ve seen recently</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">one image is the national guard marching</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">a neighborhood i think in minnesota and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">firing</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">uh riot control rounds at people sitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">on their porches</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">um so the other image is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">just whatever standard image of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">rioters kind of running amok and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">police being</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">blown away like not stopping it and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">a third image which i think i saw</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">yesterday was like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">no no two days ago was like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">people in the suburbs who like pulled</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">their trucks like to close the opening</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">to their gated community or standing out</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">front of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">the guns all right so so</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">imagine and i&#39;m not necessarily by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">way saying this is a good thing i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">saying this would be an escalation</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">because it would be an innovation that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">could then be cut that would then</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">definitely be copied</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">so imagine a circumstance where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">an escalation of the entropic energy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">the riots meaning that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">capacity of the the control structure to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">inhibit that violence by overcoating it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">with its own</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">state-of-sponsored violence shows</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">ineffectiveness so the riots</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">spread and they spread into the suburbs</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">out of the out of the cities</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">and there is a toxinous move</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">by the people inside those suburbs to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">defend themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">remember the koreans on the rooftops</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">during the rodney king riots</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">um and and they&#39;re successful right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s like a not just sort of peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">protesters walking by</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">and a bunch of people with guns but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">fact violent rioters rushing</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">and a bunch of people with guns and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">meet right and then in that meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">that moment of meeting</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">um it kind of doesn&#39;t matter where it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">goes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">moment would be an escalation event</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">because whatever happens there</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">would begin to percolate through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">and create an innovation cycle like a uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">an arms race actually specifically an</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">arms race</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">um how far that particular sub sub thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">would burn</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:16.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">fuel in that particular one</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.320" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">a separate um or somewhat distinct</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">escalation event might be something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">what are called a police riot</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">um this happened in the in the 60s i</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">think either detroit or chicago in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">chicago</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">where the you might imagine like new</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">york you could see something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">happening in new york</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">um where the police</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">slipped the leash of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">political control right so the mayor</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">says stand down</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">and the police escalate and in fact just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">go to town</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">and deploy police power now no longer</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">constrained by the political authority</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">that had been involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">and this has happened it happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">somewhat often in history and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">happened in american history several</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">and then of course would be another</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">massive escalation because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">happening primarily right now is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">separation vertically</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">in the levels of of of the legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">legitimate or expected authority so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">during coronavirus for example where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">pulled away from federal authority and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">began to form</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">uh coalitions i think they we got like</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">six or seven distinct coalitions that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">safe you know the feds we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">do this ourselves in the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">agree to mutually among each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s a breaking of vertical power</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">and then equally if you had like certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">counties in california</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">went to the government said you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2"> your quarantines we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">opening up right now right so another</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">breaking of vertical power</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">um and so obviously police breaking with</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">mayors would be a breaking of vertical</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">and that would be that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">one because that kind of dynamic that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">kind of pulling</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">generates a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">chaos because vertical power is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">structurally very difficult to replace</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">um okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">that feels like that was a lot of words</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">maybe we can uh rico here</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">all right awesome jordan um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">so yeah i&#39;m gonna announce everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna be moving to the q a</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">read that question</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">um and i&#39;m going to kick start it off</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">um in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">i think i have a very similar question</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">to a christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">i was asking um i think daniel</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">schwarkenberger at the rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">festival talked about</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">um the elections coming up in november</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">um and how either way</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">potentially 50 of the population may</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">actually figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">this this whole thing was rigged</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.240" style="s2">afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.240" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">interaction of what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">with the elections that are coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">five months yeah so it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">pretty pretty clear um that the november</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">elections are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">another um a perturbation point there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">too much that&#39;s going to happen in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">in that context</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">and and therefore by the way a huge</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">amount of energy is being focused on</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">that particular moment so</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">uh like for in terms of unconventional</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">warfare uh it&#39;s through the roof</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">at all levels so one thing is for sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">those elections are going to be rigged</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">um now they may be rigged actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">fashion which they still have they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">still real</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">there may be kind of enough counter</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">pressure to hold them together uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">i personally doubt it but this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">place that i have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">deep expertise or or like inside kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">talking to a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">looking at it more closely um</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">so let me give a little query what i</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">mean by that in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">unconventional warfare</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">one of the very first things that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">try to go after when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">destabilizing a nation state</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">if that nation state happens to be um</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">you know a democratic republic as you go</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">after the elections</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">and when you go to the elections you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">actually your best result</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">is to own the elections and have them</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.159" style="s2">look legitimate that&#39;s your best result</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">right so if you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.159" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">cause the population to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">believe that they&#39;re in a democracy when</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">in fact they&#39;re not you control what</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">the second best result is to have them</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">be illegitimate and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">break down the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">governance system to operate</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">right so that would be the the objective</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">of any agency that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">destabilize</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">uh any democratic republic okay well</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">clearly our particular electoral system</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">is sort of with its jugular exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">that kind of an attack</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">and that kind of attack is sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">pressed right now and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">important to remember like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">if you i don&#39;t know if you guys recall</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole sort of notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">russians interfering with the election</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">back in 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">and the answer is of course and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">else was too</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s important to recognize that in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">the context of interfering with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">elections</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">if i&#39;m the russians i&#39;m more interested</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">in destabilizing the the the polity that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">i am and necessarily trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">particular agent</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">on board unless i happen to really</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">really own a particular agent which</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">happens sometimes but not that commonly</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">in a large in in a large context</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing second thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">recognize that the elections</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">are multi-layered so we sometimes and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">think this is by the way a massive judo</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:51.450" style="s2">error</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">sometimes collapse the election</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.450" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">to the election of the of the chief</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">executive</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">and so they say oh that&#39;s the election</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">but important in fact like the dog</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">catcher is also going to be elected on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">that same ballot</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">and a lot of the local elections are</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.039" style="s2">actually more important because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">have a lot more uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.039" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">subtle important power so</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">uh gaming or or shifting or reshaping</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">the legitimacy of the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">election is one piece but actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">to the degree to which you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">own things like you know police</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">commissioners county commissioners</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">sheriffs that kind of thing then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">really getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">kind of the metabolism not just the kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">of the brain center</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">of a democratic republic</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">so in that context where i would say at</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">least from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of funny there&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">percent certainty that the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">election will be illegitimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s already already baked in i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">think anybody believes that either of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:51.360" style="s2">the candidates is vaguely legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">um and so no matter what happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.360" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">already sort of that&#39;s done it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">like the work of making that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">illegitimate was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">baked in at least months ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">um and probably longer now</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">and then so once you say like jeez</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">whoever wins everybody&#39;s like what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">hell just happened there and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">i mean everybody no nobody&#39;s happy</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">either way</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">except for a very tiny tiny fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">people um</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">so then the bigger questions and also is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">there a capacity and desire to point</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">at and generate a cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">armored story around the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">full illegitimacy of the election right</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">the full rejection right so one is kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">of like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">passive oh this is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">legitimate the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">stepping forward and it&#39;s less about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">degree to which the election is</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">illegitimate and more about the degree</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">which there is a coherent capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">organize</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">a adequate number of effective people to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">actually promote that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">really into the world that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s definitely going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">competition to see if that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">and it remains to be seen whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">that kind of level of coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">possible right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">then you have the things that are going</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">on deeper and i think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">almost like put it as</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">you can kind of collapse that whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">sphere into more or less two</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">states one state is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">you know is the is the pyramid solid but</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">the top</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">is kind of wobbly the other state is do</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">you invert it and the whole pyramid is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">wobbly</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">um if there&#39;s a very deep felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">the the whole election process like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">notion that the democracy itself is no</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">functional um then you&#39;ve entered into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">massive</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">phase transition um</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">if if not if there&#39;s still a deep felt</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">that it&#39;s a uh still a struggle to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">figure out how to win</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">in through roughly ordinary politics uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">then we&#39;re sort of still where we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">um and the and the can the decay</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">continues across all dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">okay i hope that was even it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">somewhat useful in the context of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">sure i think a lot of people think of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">just the presidency</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">um but a lot of local elections are</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">where a lot of the power is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">gained so ah civilizational consequences</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">right so that&#39;s um the other piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">just think about in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">the bigger picture the bigger story um</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:25.679" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">jesus oh see</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.679" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">well let me back up obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">is i&#39;m largely presenting my frame right</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">to degree which that&#39;s helpful great</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">which is not helpful just</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">throw it away so within the context of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">my frame</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">we are very much in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">of of civilization level</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">transition and in fact i think i&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">it publicly a few times</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">from my perspective we&#39;re like at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">moment of the transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">at the level that gave rise to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">civilization as a thing so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">like going from</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">rome to the middle ages uh we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">from pre-agriculture to agriculture or</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">right and in that context it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">i think the case that if we end up</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">in the with the the election scenario</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">where the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">pyramid is wobbly i said a major phase</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">um i think we&#39;ve moved we will have</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">moved</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">a lot into that place so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">the liminal war will have become much</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">higher because</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">to the degree to which the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">blue church control structure now read</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">globally</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">the capacity of the blue church which by</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">the 90s had entrained</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">the entire world right the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2">was entrained to the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">to the degree to which that control</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">structure is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">effectively gone right if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">falls into a uh kind of a liminal free</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">fall</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">then everything&#39;s up for grabs at a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">global level</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">and the crisis you know the don&#39;t let a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">good crisis go</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">to waste mindset that had happened in</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">will now happen all the way and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:11.200" style="s2">it is my perspective right now it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">of looking at it it&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.200" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">perspective for a decade</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">that at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">the system bifurcates right either a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">a new coherence finds a way to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">hold all the energy that&#39;s that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">current environment which by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">right post nuclear um or</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">there&#39;s just a series of what are called</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">rip stop breaks right</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">just things continue to break and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">don&#39;t really know where the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">that is but it&#39;s pretty deep as far as</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">thought about that a lot i don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">any natural place where that stops</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">we can go to that as well but yes i</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">think that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">a full destabilization of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">uh the blue church in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">completely demoralized election in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">november</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">begins the what i would call the end</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">game like the full</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">full movement into the liberal war</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m feeling a little bit sad and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">scared i want to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">just to talk about maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">positive direction i want to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">travis</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">man girl earlier question around</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.839" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">so jordan in your assessment are there</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">plausible scenarios where the us slash</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">makes it out of our current situation of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">like continuing escalation</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">and authoritative crackdowns uh to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">another era of like internal peace and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">or do you really feel like all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">plausible scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">have this ship just going down no i</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">there&#39;s there there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">well two plausible scenarios um</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">that are in what we consider sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">upside</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">the plausible scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">is somewhat temporary in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">it it&#39;s kind of like the the post-war uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">situation where it has a it forms a form</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">of coherence the by the way will feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">really good and generative</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">and we&#39;ll have a lot of um like</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;ll be kind of a golden age but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last that long</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">like it it this has to do with a meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">theory of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">uh time is more a matter of bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">than it is of fixed</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">moments and so basically as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">bandwidth goes up the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">period of objective time like numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">times the earth goes around the sun</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">decreases in the lifespan of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">particular complicated civilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:52.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s likely one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">major upgrade at this civilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.960" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">structure level that is a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">civilization structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">that is is plausible and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">something like a neil stephenson&#39;s files</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be non-geographic values</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">you know virtuality mediated aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:14.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">files which are sort of coordinated</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">that have some level of interoperability</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">between them that inhibits significant</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">conflict between them something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">that like something along that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">that sort of sensibility um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">that and by the way now i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">using a whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:32.200" style="s2">theories to sort of generate a rough</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">very rough estimate but that has maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">25-year</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">timeline to it so it&#39;s going to be weird</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">and then suddenly be no longer vital and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">then disappear</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">in like one human like one youth one</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">human generation</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">the second path is is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">what&#39;s called a portal pathway an</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">evolutionary theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">single cellular organisms multicellular</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">organisms</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">and then suddenly you know a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">multicellular organism happens on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">same landscape as single solid organisms</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:04.240" style="s2">but once it happens it creates a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">new dynamic right it&#39;s a single one-way</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.240" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">trip and now</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">you know we all multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">are literally a kind of single cellular</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">organism of particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">kind but now it becomes its own subset</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">so the other plausible path is a portal</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">pathway to a different domain that is as</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">different from the domain of what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">called game a which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">the sum total of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">civilizations post-agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">um as that was from the hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">method right which which i&#39;ve called</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">so that is another plausible uh</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">and the the probability of that</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">sort of baked in like this is what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:42.840" style="s2">was gonna look like</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">still more or less in the same stream</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">and the problem with probability in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">estimation is not very high but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">important to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">any mechanism is endeavoring to think</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">it is definitely the case that i can</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">identify that as being a plausible</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">a dominant narrative uh during the you</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">the rest of the 20th century that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">a primary mechanism of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">control structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">is to to sort of own the image</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">uh and to present that image repeatably</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">with uh consistency</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">now in the context of the the</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">there&#39;s the ability to create what you</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">or different narratives uh which of</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">becomes willy-nilly right the capacity</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">because almost impossible and images of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">all sorts can outflow into the</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">outside of the control structure of blue</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s one vector and that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">that can be shaped and will it can and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">will be shaped by any kind of agent</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">that&#39;s endeavoring to use</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">mechanisms of unconventional warfare so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">it is a uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the basic toolkit like if i</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">go into yemen one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">i&#39;ll do is i&#39;ll begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">endeavoring to generate different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">of images</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">and by the way doing lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">them and finding the ones that stick and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">then up regulating those like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s an evolutionary approach in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">mode and so of course without doing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">in u.s or japan i&#39;ll do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">um and to the maximum extent possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">what i&#39;ll do is actually try to enlist</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">toxinous groups in the in the local</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">cultural milieu who</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">will have a much richer sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">around what will actually work in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">local environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">find ones that have uh expressions that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">i feel at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">generally tend to shape things in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">preferred preferred direction</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">and then up regulate those so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">that that normally works but then also</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">remember the other side which is just</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">pure chaos</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">right so unconventional warfare i either</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">want to to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">sort of get things to go my way or i</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">want to destabilize things either one is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">a pretty good result</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">and so to just generate pure chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">useful and literally</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">of all i can do is just jack people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.119" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">attention system and jerk people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">attention system around so they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">actually engage in coherent effective</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">making then again at the unconventional</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">warfare level i&#39;ve done a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">did that respond to your question in any</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">sorry about that my internet cut off</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">i am a little unsure what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">now i hear there&#39;s some silence</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">um the last conversation ended and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">were waiting for you to do something</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">alternatively peter was was inviting us</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">into a moment of silence without</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">saying anything which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">commonplace move for him</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">i like that move</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">i got a question phil um yeah i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">go ahead pierre yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">so jordan you suggested that previously</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">to phil and i about having um</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:21.280" style="s2">sort of like sense making sessions here</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">at the store with experts uh where we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">get different experts together to kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">of sense make um</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">you know a certain issue and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">thinking of having a sense making town</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">halls</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">that we can kind of like prototype here</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">at the stoa that could be used in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">local setting</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">via zoom or something like akin to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">and like a stoic news channel where we</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">kind of like sense make uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">news items um so i just uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">you have any advice or any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">david jones</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">i said the same thing so that is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">what i suggested</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">uh it&#39;s the exact opposite of what i</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">suggested almost the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">inverse what i suggested was a practice</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">whereby a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">did two things simultaneously on the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">there was a probably asynchronous and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">probably text-based</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">effort to engage in a collective inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">to discern the questions that seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">which would probably take over a period</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">of time so imagine in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">chat there was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">an ongoing conversation and some</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">mechanism to among the entire groups to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">say okay here are the set of questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">that are the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece of the story the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">piece of the story would then be to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">enlist from the body from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">and potentially from from the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">who do we collectively sense are those</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">who would have the highest quality sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">around this particular set of questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">and what i mean by that the key of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">is is much less the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">the result of the interaction so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">say let&#39;s just say by hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">somebody mentioned the portal so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">say by hypothesis a set of questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">came up and they was like yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">really feels weighty and heavy</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">and then in that process there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">and i&#39;d really like to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">sort of eric weinstein and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">zizek have a conversation about it like</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">that feels like that&#39;s the marriage</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">made in heaven yes that could be super</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">cool and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">but much more important is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">cultivation of discernment around those</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">two different activities</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in every distinct</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">individual right so the discernment of</p>

<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">field of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">high quality sense making in this domain</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">because there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">that needs to be cultivated like to whom</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">will you go</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">to get better sense making in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">particular meaningful location</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">is a primary capacity for any possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">future state like</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">building that into the network each</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">person has to have a capacity to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">what are the valid nodes like what are</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">the places where the richness of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">sense making is very very high</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">like highest gradient nutrition in terms</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">um and by the way it&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.440" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">be outside of you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">by definition that&#39;s the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">this thing right collective speaking is</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">always that so</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">um and it&#39;s never going to going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">completely flat well sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">might be completely flat it might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">this thing is so chaotic that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">the best answer is just to grab a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">random people and just see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">but in many cases there are people for</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">whom</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">a particular domain is in fact a place</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">where their life arc has put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">place where their</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">insight is deep they have wisdom in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">domain and to act to know that to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">able to grok that and sense that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">and call them into their place of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">to share that wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">is a primary activity then the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">is that in every given node there needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">to be a capacity to have a sensing into</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">reducing the noise in yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">orienting towards the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">every individual must always be working</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">this is moving from salience to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">relevance in vivek&#39;s language right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">so the collective practice of working</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">together to increase our individual and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">collective capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">to move into what is most meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">not constantly get distracted by our</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">salience landscaping which sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">grabs the shiniest object mostly</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">rhetorically</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">but actually being able to settle and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">say okay yeah that actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">important question that&#39;s the places</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">we&#39;re spending some time and energy on</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">if we get that piece</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">with more clarity then we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">make a solid step forward right</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">as one vector and then wisdom as another</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">vector that was that was what i proposed</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">as a a useful thing for you guys to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">spend some time on</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">yeah um oh sorry and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">i used eric weinstein and zizek as</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.359" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">but it probably won&#39;t look ideally it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.359" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">will stop looking like that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">a that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">artifact of a broadcast modality like</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">the notion that you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">names that you know and they have some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">number of followers greater than ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">is an artifact of a topology that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">definitely not effective</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.319" style="s2">in terms of collective intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">what we would want this thing to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">into over time</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">is a situation where is a much finer</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">grained level of intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">and in fact probably has iterations so</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">you might imagine a group of 1000</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">people would form clusters of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">and out of that hundred they would</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">actually surface from their interiority</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">the ones who seem to be the most called</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">to provide wisdom in a particular domain</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">and then you would actually have each of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">those groups would then actually have</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">interactions so the idea is you actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">want to have this be generated from</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">not a pointing to this notion of expert</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">the idea of expert needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">extinguished</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">very cool um there&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">desire for my side to know um almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">jump in to um</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">like break our rooms and us all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">to try and do some sense making around</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">the question of what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">especially regarding the riots um</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">and having everybody here kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">participate in that and see where it</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">um but i did want to ask you jordan</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">if you feel like you want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">another question</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">or any final thoughts that you may have</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.839" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.839" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">or we can also uh do what i did last</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.319" style="s2">time pick someone who we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">seen talk before and see if they have</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.319" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">any interesting questions for you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">let me just quickly scroll and see if</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">anything pops</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">now it feels like everything is is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">moving in more in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">breakout session</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s good all right any any final</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">thoughts before</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">we break into the breakout session my</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">final thought is i</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">i sincerely hope this is the last time</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">that i&#39;m in this group</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">i sincerely hope that from this point</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">forward it is entirely happening as an</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">evolutionary dynamic happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">peer-to-peer and that i have no</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">particular special</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">place like my name shouldn&#39;t matter</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">appreciated the high level view which</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">helped me at least ground what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">happening on the day-to-day</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">to look like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">yeah certainly so it it&#39;s very relevant</p>

<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">perspectives so that we can uh discern</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">which ones are most useful at which</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">crack that code and get the right</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">enabling constraints in order to make</p>
