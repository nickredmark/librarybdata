<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">projects and this other group I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">is the canonical debate lab so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">bunch of people coming together helping</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">people kind of argue more effectively or</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">communicate more effectively when they</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">have disagreements and it&#39;s for people</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">that have the same kind of goal post L</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">their own projects and we still can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:13.190" style="s2">like set aside our vision to work on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:16.379" style="s2">shared vision or their vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.190" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">it&#39;s really tough and I and I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.379" end="00:02:21.090" style="s2">do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">so I can&#39;t I mean so I I think I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.090" end="00:02:25.709" style="s2">really just trying to be helping</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">everyone out on their individual</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">were discussing on Facebook and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.159" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">hopefully at some point they will start</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">kind of merging together where the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:49.079" style="s2">visions collide because actually Kylie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">vision sounded really close to together</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.079" end="00:02:56.069" style="s2">Tech except not tech focus maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:02:58.519" style="s2">getting curing Kylie except she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">about it but it sounded like it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.940" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">this coming tackle something similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">yeah she talked about what she&#39;s doing</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">but the week before she gave us I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.880" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">a rundown maybe it was during the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">number one that we did she gave a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">rundown to what she was doing and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">um a little bit more in the Omega group</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:41.849" style="s2">but having I liked the idea the idea you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">propose on Facebook I sorry I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.849" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">distracted because I&#39;m trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">the the thing we did last week at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">very end where we posted the question</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:55.560" style="s2">and people people responded just to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">it to refer to but that having people be</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.560" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">able to bring because I wanted to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:04:01.049" style="s2">people who have project so we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">conversation so that we can build what</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.049" end="00:04:04.889" style="s2">your is the difficulty that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">talking about right that like we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.889" end="00:04:08.790" style="s2">have our own vision we all have our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">needs our own challenges how do you work</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.790" end="00:04:14.160" style="s2">together to have sovereignty and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">like leaderless group right like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.160" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">does a non hierarchical corporation look</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">like right because if we can&#39;t do it at</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.660" end="00:04:22.349" style="s2">a micro level that&#39;s safe enough to fail</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">how do we hope to do it at a government</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.349" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">a national or even a citywide level</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">and but that was kind of we focused on</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:32.360" style="s2">the question of like this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:33.590" style="s2">doing and why don&#39;t you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.360" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">involved I remember the exact questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.590" end="00:04:38.600" style="s2">but which is good I got a lot out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:41.270" style="s2">that I think it was a good structure to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.600" end="00:04:43.460" style="s2">ask like why what doesn&#39;t work about</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:45.050" style="s2">this and of course part of its lack of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">vision right like they don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.050" end="00:04:49.910" style="s2">like that piece like us coming together</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:52.700" style="s2">and figuring out the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.910" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">struggle the interpersonal struggle the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.700" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">and then a project to work around is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.450" style="s2">maybe not quite what it was like people</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">which is what I&#39;ve gotten a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.450" end="00:05:03.950" style="s2">like people either could help but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:05.450" style="s2">see the vision or they kind of would</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.950" end="00:05:08.360" style="s2">like to be involved but they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.450" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">they&#39;re either they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.360" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">capacity or the capability right which</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">capacity I get we only have so many</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2">hours in a day but the capability it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:19.510" style="s2">like do you want to help bring you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">the table that&#39;s enough your ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.510" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of my people</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:29.930" style="s2">don&#39;t have the confidence to think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">their ideas and their they&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:32.810" style="s2">enough that they&#39;re good enough and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.130" style="s2">get it because I went through that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.810" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">still going through that struggle I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:40.190" style="s2">think everyone that&#39;s life but like how</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:42.440" style="s2">to get people over that but maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.190" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">just not our job or my job in any way</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.440" end="00:05:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like what people want to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:47.510" style="s2">together be transparent but doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.920" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">the way that you suggested where we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.510" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">an idea cafe around other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">projects that like I was like why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.920" style="s2">we just hold ideas cafes about idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">about together tech and have them work</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.920" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">on our project what yours is better is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:05.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah why I think then we can I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:06.770" style="s2">think one of the natural things would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.180" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">to do some of their projects first and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.770" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">then do ours as one of those projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:12.110" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:14.690" style="s2">one we&#39;ve worked us on the kinks and two</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.110" end="00:06:16.730" style="s2">it&#39;s more here is what&#39;s in it for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.690" end="00:06:18.350" style="s2">right away right we&#39;re not like it also</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.730" end="00:06:20.450" style="s2">feels like if we have asking people to</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.919" end="00:06:52.830" style="s2">organically what we can do for one</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">another right as a meta group of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.830" end="00:06:59.219" style="s2">with projects like what is the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.210" end="00:07:01.409" style="s2">thing that would help us move forward in</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.729" end="00:07:10.349" style="s2">put in money and time and trust into</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.370" end="00:07:13.110" style="s2">each individual one in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.349" end="00:07:15.150" style="s2">it so I like that idea now how do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.110" end="00:07:16.979" style="s2">actually execute it I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.150" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">want to use so the one thing though is I</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:25.379" style="s2">space because the Tuesday space is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.169" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">the game B idea cafe what is because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.379" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t really be an idea cafe first of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">all would be on this channel because</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t even know how we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:32.699" style="s2">do that like someone could give their</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:34.050" style="s2">pitch and then we could each take five</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.699" end="00:07:37.710" style="s2">minutes to give them a critique or</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:41.909" style="s2">positives it&#39;s definitely a format yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.710" end="00:07:43.469" style="s2">and so one is that right like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.909" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">chicken-and-egg but like picking a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.469" end="00:07:47.129" style="s2">format and then trying it and saying how</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">did it work how did it work for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.129" end="00:07:51.689" style="s2">group it&#39;s a crowd sourcing or</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">brainstorming and how did it work for</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.689" end="00:07:56.219" style="s2">the person right like I love it when</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.589" style="s2">people pick apart my idea like that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.219" end="00:08:00.710" style="s2">like I love the debate piece that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.589" end="00:08:02.909" style="s2">like where the energy is I enjoy it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.710" end="00:08:04.259" style="s2">don&#39;t enjoy it for some reason people</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.909" end="00:08:05.669" style="s2">pick apart pieces of it that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.259" end="00:08:07.439" style="s2">actually about my project right like</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.669" end="00:08:10.469" style="s2">people like capitalism work so like oh</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.189" end="00:08:17.939" style="s2">to commit 7.5 billion I need to convince</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:19.289" style="s2">or not even convince people already</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.939" end="00:08:21.479" style="s2">convinced when they hear it right like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.289" end="00:08:22.949" style="s2">they know that the right people will</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.479" end="00:08:24.659" style="s2">come on board at the right time we will</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.949" end="00:08:27.180" style="s2">grow it organically and naturally in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.659" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">moment it&#39;s just my outie going things</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.180" end="00:08:30.569" style="s2">they get that trigger but if people find</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.569" end="00:08:35.699" style="s2">attack if it&#39;s like well this can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.459" end="00:08:38.099" style="s2">because that part I enjoy it&#39;s it&#39;s my</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.910" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">format depending on the person&#39;s willing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.790" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">to you know a level of what level of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:30.149" style="s2">contingent they want in their feedback</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:31.380" style="s2">because it it you know it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.149" end="00:10:36.509" style="s2">thinking kind of here&#39;s the pitch and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.380" end="00:10:38.250" style="s2">help me work on my pitch or pitch is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.509" end="00:10:40.649" style="s2">probably you know more of a game a term</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.250" end="00:10:42.300" style="s2">but you know my ex how I&#39;m explaining it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.649" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">and stuff like that also you know ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.300" end="00:10:47.250" style="s2">clarifying questions that will help work</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:49.889" style="s2">on explaining it to people and then does</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.250" end="00:10:51.959" style="s2">anyone have any resources or aware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.889" end="00:10:54.209" style="s2">any similar projects that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.959" end="00:10:58.139" style="s2">they should do so be information finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.209" end="00:11:00.630" style="s2">and then ask people you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.139" end="00:11:03.870" style="s2">they would help share and is there any</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.630" end="00:11:05.550" style="s2">sort of non-committed you know well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.870" end="00:11:08.190" style="s2">mean if anyone wants to commit</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.550" end="00:11:13.080" style="s2">being on a project that&#39;s great but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.190" end="00:11:17.220" style="s2">if there&#39;s some low low commitment sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.080" end="00:11:19.500" style="s2">of ways to help so we kind of support</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.220" end="00:11:21.180" style="s2">each other and say you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.500" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">trying to do here build a community</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.180" end="00:11:25.079" style="s2">build on this game be community to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:30.269" style="s2">support each other&#39;s projects and kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.079" end="00:11:34.769" style="s2">of set that as the social norm I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.269" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">that Fitz can be principled so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.769" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">that sort of thing and then give an</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">option to say have the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:46.649" style="s2">presenting talks or do they want to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:47.820" style="s2">people kind of poke holes in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.649" end="00:11:52.950" style="s2">what&#39;s their level of that because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.820" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve I&#39;ve had quite a few ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.950" end="00:12:03.750" style="s2">I guess two things one I&#39;ve heard a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">of holes poked in it and it is good</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.750" end="00:12:09.750" style="s2">though that I need to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:12.750" style="s2">address those confusions at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.750" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">beginning right in the pitch head move</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.750" end="00:12:17.270" style="s2">off although a lot of times it seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">like no matter how I and all the pitch</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.270" end="00:12:22.920" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have the question like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:26.070" style="s2">can&#39;t cover like the all four things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.920" end="00:12:27.810" style="s2">the pitch and so whichever one I missed</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.070" end="00:12:29.520" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna they&#39;re gonna latch on and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.810" end="00:12:30.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna be kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.520" end="00:12:32.430" style="s2">explain but also being able to answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.990" end="00:12:35.880" style="s2">that question quickly and efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.430" end="00:12:38.270" style="s2">and practicing that and since we do rule</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.880" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">Omega if we&#39;re doing in the game B space</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.270" end="00:12:45.060" style="s2">then them hoping us also craft that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">response because they&#39;ll be listening</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.060" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">much more effectively than just every</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:54.209" style="s2">people in the regular world I think it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:56.459" style="s2">be a great way to practice rule Omega 2</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.209" end="00:12:58.290" style="s2">because we want them to come in and want</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.459" end="00:12:59.540" style="s2">them to pull the information out of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.290" end="00:13:01.769" style="s2">that we&#39;re having trouble expressing</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.540" end="00:13:04.589" style="s2">right that&#39;s what royal mega is all</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.769" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">about so I think just as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.589" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">practice for practicing or Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">then getting the support on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:15.199" style="s2">projects and having it feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:17.940" style="s2">project&#39;s our community involved I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.199" end="00:13:19.590" style="s2">would be great benefits and then yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.940" end="00:13:20.610" style="s2">some point our projects will come in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.590" end="00:13:22.650" style="s2">although the more I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.610" end="00:13:28.700" style="s2">this I think my like recent score</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.650" end="00:13:32.580" style="s2">project is will trigger game be people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.700" end="00:13:34.529" style="s2">in a negative way which i think is good</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.580" end="00:13:35.700" style="s2">I think that like because the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.529" end="00:13:39.180" style="s2">we&#39;re all approaching this from very</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.700" end="00:13:41.089" style="s2">different ways and that is the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.180" end="00:13:43.890" style="s2">that we need to be able to create it</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.089" end="00:13:46.170" style="s2">like everyone&#39;s like that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.890" end="00:13:47.490" style="s2">this matters right like like currencies</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.170" end="00:13:49.560" style="s2">the number one thing or the means of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.490" end="00:13:51.510" style="s2">production or political or forget all</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.560" end="00:13:54.450" style="s2">that it&#39;s all about interpersonal miss</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.510" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">meditate and those all are needed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.450" end="00:14:01.050" style="s2">just in the Omega rule finding the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.050" end="00:14:02.610" style="s2">allowance for you do your thing I do my</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.050" end="00:14:04.650" style="s2">thing and how do we support each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">in it and so I think that things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.650" end="00:14:08.029" style="s2">raisin score although maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.050" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.029" end="00:14:12.060" style="s2">uber game be right like it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.040" style="s2">logic in the debate</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.060" end="00:14:16.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like though that foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.040" end="00:14:18.779" style="s2">information is still absolutely needed</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.380" end="00:14:22.050" style="s2">because not everyone&#39;s gonna be getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.779" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">B and not like if you look it together</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.050" end="00:14:27.020" style="s2">Tech org which is about to be up because</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:29.610" style="s2">I&#39;m meeting with the person this week</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.020" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">all of the stuff on there all of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.610" end="00:14:33.420" style="s2">projects are intellectual projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:35.070" style="s2">they&#39;re like the IMDB for politicians</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.420" end="00:14:37.170" style="s2">and my brothers now working on and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.070" end="00:14:38.970" style="s2">you know an education as an online</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.170" end="00:14:40.920" style="s2">school and and all these kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.970" end="00:14:43.470" style="s2">because that is the foundation of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.920" end="00:14:46.230" style="s2">we need is a collective to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.470" end="00:14:48.420" style="s2">move forward right like everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.230" end="00:14:50.430" style="s2">complex but if you have information and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.420" end="00:14:52.170" style="s2">we&#39;re having to define everything every</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.430" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">time and figuring out is climate change</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:58.200" style="s2">even real before we tackle it that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:00.450" style="s2">you don&#39;t even like you do your research</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.200" end="00:15:01.770" style="s2">okay but it doesn&#39;t help if I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.450" end="00:15:03.720" style="s2">done mine and it doesn&#39;t help if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.770" end="00:15:06.060" style="s2">don&#39;t have a common pool to use right</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.720" end="00:15:07.470" style="s2">and debate tools are important I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.060" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">want to participate in debates that much</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.470" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">anymore I don&#39;t find them except the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:15.330" style="s2">muddle about my effect I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:21.330" style="s2">every they&#39;re very low value mm-hmm like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.330" end="00:15:24.330" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna enjoy tearing other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.330" end="00:15:27.990" style="s2">down a debate is a verbal debate is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.330" end="00:15:30.570" style="s2">productive yeah yeah and so finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.990" end="00:15:33.330" style="s2">to get the productive peace out of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.570" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">debate get the productive peace out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.330" end="00:15:41.160" style="s2">just information right whatever you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.810" end="00:15:42.839" style="s2">have that is black white or gray area</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.160" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">right make it very black and white that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.839" end="00:15:49.649" style="s2">it&#39;s gray area to have it be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:51.450" style="s2">foundational like Wikipedia kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.649" end="00:15:52.920" style="s2">right for like that and if one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.450" end="00:15:55.079" style="s2">number one places people go to you like</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">the Wikipedia article it&#39;s not owned by</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.079" end="00:15:59.399" style="s2">us and there&#39;s clearly problems with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:01.620" style="s2">but having something like that or like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.399" end="00:16:03.329" style="s2">look we tackle climate change not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.620" end="00:16:04.920" style="s2">government not the scientists not we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.329" end="00:16:06.870" style="s2">said what was everything we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.920" end="00:16:08.820" style="s2">know and then the enemy nor any of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.870" end="00:16:11.640" style="s2">other versions that are out there having</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.820" end="00:16:13.649" style="s2">a way to make more reason together</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.640" end="00:16:15.480" style="s2">instead of one-off I have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.649" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">knowledge and debate you which is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.480" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">not gonna help because neither of us are</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:20.279" style="s2">going to change our minds I just</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:24.329" style="s2">realized that reason score is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.279" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">structured omega rule okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.329" end="00:16:29.670" style="s2">not it doesn&#39;t cover everything but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:34.019" style="s2">similar to Omega rule and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.670" end="00:16:36.870" style="s2">you can&#39;t dismiss anyone&#39;s statement you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.019" end="00:16:38.850" style="s2">can&#39;t just ignore it it it affects the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.870" end="00:16:42.540" style="s2">score so you kind of have to discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.850" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">and the thing is you have is that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.540" end="00:16:47.100" style="s2">encourages people to think deeply about</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:49.110" style="s2">what people say and what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.100" end="00:16:51.750" style="s2">saying and there&#39;s even a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.110" end="00:16:54.899" style="s2">going in and editing their statement as</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.750" end="00:16:59.790" style="s2">a group workshopping that statement to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.899" end="00:17:04.589" style="s2">be more and more clear I just huh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.790" end="00:17:06.510" style="s2">never all right except even if you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.589" end="00:17:08.280" style="s2">actually go through again and look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.510" end="00:17:09.540" style="s2">you&#39;re under that lens and be like how</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.280" end="00:17:11.329" style="s2">does this become even more that because</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.540" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what society needs is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.329" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">find the commonality in our debate right</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:19.050" style="s2">the Omega rule how do you find them</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s signal in the noise and how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.050" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">you help anyone as someone who has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">of noise but a lot of really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:27.089" style="s2">signal as well it&#39;s like I need that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">help and I that was when we posted that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.089" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">um last week on game B and Jordan I</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.169" style="s2">think REE</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.669" style="s2">rematch the question he was like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.169" end="00:17:38.220" style="s2">understand it and we kind of unpacked it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.669" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">a bit and then he redid what it was I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:42.090" style="s2">think and he was like okay I love it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.350" style="s2">like that&#39;s I don&#39;t have time to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.090" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">involved but like yeah I hope wish</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.350" end="00:17:46.530" style="s2">people would be involved kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.530" end="00:17:49.920" style="s2">that is the kind of thing that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">help other people do for their projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.920" end="00:17:53.880" style="s2">right like there was and then Chanel</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:55.530" style="s2">talked about transparency that she</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.880" end="00:17:58.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t think like transparencies which</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.530" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">have gotten a lot of that isn&#39;t like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.260" end="00:18:01.230" style="s2">can&#39;t be transparent all the time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:02.580" style="s2">like I get that but it&#39;s about being</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.230" end="00:18:04.470" style="s2">transparent about when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.580" end="00:18:06.900" style="s2">transparent and creating it again from</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.470" end="00:18:08.070" style="s2">the ground up is how do the if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.900" end="00:18:09.480" style="s2">you know how did the two of us be</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.070" end="00:18:11.010" style="s2">transparent this is very transparent</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.480" end="00:18:12.270" style="s2">we&#39;re live on YouTube I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.010" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">we&#39;d be more transparent than this</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.270" end="00:18:18.360" style="s2">besides the financial information which</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">we will when that&#39;s a thing yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.360" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">is no financial information because</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:25.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no money put in yet right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">when there&#39;s ten of us it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.800" end="00:18:29.910" style="s2">little bit harder but we can still you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:31.710" style="s2">know have a median or have like when</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.910" end="00:18:33.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a record of it now that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.710" end="00:18:34.950" style="s2">transparent if you&#39;re not gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.270" end="00:18:38.430" style="s2">through it constantly so getting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.950" end="00:18:40.230" style="s2">tags and the part that makes data usable</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.430" end="00:18:42.060" style="s2">and understandable is to me what</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.230" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">transparency is it&#39;s like making sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.060" end="00:18:46.860" style="s2">all information that is needed is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:49.230" style="s2">accessible to everybody and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.860" end="00:18:51.060" style="s2">that&#39;s usable and understandable except</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.230" end="00:18:53.880" style="s2">where that information being available</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.060" end="00:18:55.560" style="s2">is going to be a detriment to someone or</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.880" end="00:18:57.470" style="s2">the project itself in which case we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.790" end="00:22:24.630" style="s2">because I wouldn&#39;t want to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.260" end="00:22:27.630" style="s2">better I think it&#39;s a cool I love Lego</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.630" end="00:22:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like it looks to be like blocks of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.630" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">Lego that are like you put together to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.820" end="00:22:32.490" style="s2">be a factory in my mind that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.340" end="00:22:33.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.490" end="00:22:36.690" style="s2">and it reminds me of this is the TED</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.960" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">talk does it call the construction set</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.690" end="00:22:41.250" style="s2">for a new society or something where it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:42.690" style="s2">was like building the the farm equipment</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.250" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">and a bakery and all the things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.690" end="00:22:46.530" style="s2">would need to have a small village but</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:47.790" style="s2">using interconnected parts which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.530" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">still I think a project but hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.790" end="00:22:51.570" style="s2">really gotten the babies had a TED talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:52.770" style="s2">they didn&#39;t necessarily get although</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.570" end="00:22:54.210" style="s2">they would last time I check them out</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.770" end="00:22:55.290" style="s2">which was a few months ago they had</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.210" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">moved forward with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.290" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">different machines and so was I point of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:06.630" style="s2">all this bringing that up um yeah about</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">cubes you thought might also be their</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.630" end="00:23:14.790" style="s2">project whatever you just called it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:17.490" style="s2">say projects form projects Horomia yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.790" end="00:23:20.160" style="s2">I like that I think maybe that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.490" end="00:23:28.440" style="s2">like a swarm of projects as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.160" end="00:23:31.050" style="s2">swarm of paper how PDI&#39;s yeah yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.440" end="00:23:33.179" style="s2">wondering whether swarm triggers people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.050" end="00:23:37.370" style="s2">harness uh but it&#39;s the idea of just</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.179" end="00:23:41.730" style="s2">temporarily giving focus to a project</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.370" end="00:23:43.380" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;ll workshop that some and send</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.730" end="00:23:45.990" style="s2">you the description then we can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.380" end="00:23:50.210" style="s2">discuss it and then I guess we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.990" end="00:23:50.210" style="s2">to do another doodle poll to find a time</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">sounds good I am I mean I could I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">the Tuesday idea cafe which I still want</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:00.679" style="s2">to do in the new year Wednesday I have</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.770" end="00:24:13.050" style="s2">possibly the other option is to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.580" end="00:24:15.540" style="s2">Saturdays the one I do with my brother</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.050" end="00:24:16.860" style="s2">actually could be for like that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.540" end="00:24:18.470" style="s2">of division but to have people keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.860" end="00:24:24.419" style="s2">coming back and brainstorm each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.470" end="00:24:27.450" style="s2">so having like equals four yet exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.419" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">mean it&#39;d be a space</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.030" end="00:26:31.740" style="s2">not always supposed to go back and learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.500" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">the same things like everyone&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.740" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">read the same books everyone&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.210" style="s2">listen to the same lectures and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:38.670" style="s2">which would honestly be amazing anyway</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.210" end="00:26:39.870" style="s2">and then we&#39;d be able to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.670" end="00:26:41.220" style="s2">conversation but we can&#39;t there&#39;s too</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:07.169" style="s2">Facebook group that was called by that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.950" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">name but I think that&#39;s used in pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.169" end="00:27:16.039" style="s2">much every that&#39;s all bit decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:20.039" style="s2">yeah Marcin yeah I&#39;m consistently</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.039" end="00:27:27.659" style="s2">googling terms in the game be space and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.039" end="00:27:29.429" style="s2">people and I&#39;ve just had to come to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.659" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2">terms that I&#39;m not gonna understand half</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.429" end="00:27:33.900" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on I think cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:35.340" style="s2">know you can&#39;t know unless we create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.900" end="00:27:37.860" style="s2">tool to make it easily understandable</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.340" end="00:27:39.179" style="s2">right like who&#39;s talking to who and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.860" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">did they come up with like I you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.179" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">listen to every you had even listed all</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:47.789" style="s2">these conversations and the Omega rule</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.960" end="00:27:50.460" style="s2">that we&#39;re posting you like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.789" end="00:27:51.510" style="s2">Cafe is like you can&#39;t watch them all</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.460" end="00:27:53.190" style="s2">nor should you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.510" end="00:27:54.600" style="s2">the point is to participate where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.190" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">want to and then it would be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.600" end="00:28:00.090" style="s2">have um to know to know what was talked</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">about and then the gist of it to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.090" end="00:28:05.250" style="s2">that yeah game be key concept videos</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.929" style="s2">that I can&#39;t remember his actual name</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.250" end="00:28:08.090" style="s2">but liberate mankind&#39;s his YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.929" end="00:28:10.200" style="s2">channel</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.090" end="00:28:12.150" style="s2">those have been really helpful to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.200" end="00:28:14.460" style="s2">because a couple of the ones I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:18.590" style="s2">knew and I guess I did to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.460" end="00:28:18.590" style="s2">but um it helped clarify some of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:26.010" style="s2">nuances so yeah I kind of see in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.809" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">future it&#39;d be nice to have something</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.010" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">expands on that I would also like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.059" end="00:28:38.750" style="s2">work on a terminology that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.929" end="00:28:40.280" style="s2">obscure</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.750" end="00:28:42.830" style="s2">like I think there&#39;s a better word for</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.280" end="00:28:46.280" style="s2">Omega rule than I&#39;ll make a rule that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.830" end="00:28:47.390" style="s2">requires less education but I could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.280" end="00:28:50.030" style="s2">rolling actually that one&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.390" end="00:28:53.929" style="s2">complex to explain and a couple more in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.030" end="00:28:55.549" style="s2">an intuitive manner ya know even risk</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.929" end="00:28:58.220" style="s2">participating like Star TV I&#39;ll make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.549" end="00:28:59.240" style="s2">rule group and then once I was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.220" end="00:29:00.830" style="s2">ever practice and make a roll is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.240" end="00:29:02.179" style="s2">wait what&#39;s alpha rule if I wouldn&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.830" end="00:29:03.169" style="s2">the question on Facebook something I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.179" end="00:29:06.440" style="s2">can&#39;t find it anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.169" end="00:29:08.120" style="s2">and you can&#39;t really do alpha without</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.440" end="00:29:09.500" style="s2">Omega or make it without alpha it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.120" end="00:29:10.970" style="s2">finding the signal is one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:12.679" style="s2">finding it like letting the noise go</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.970" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like kind of the other one so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.679" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">like you surrender on to signal what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:18.350" style="s2">signal is one of them and render on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.210" style="s2">noise what is know is this the other and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.210" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">problems with that is that there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:33.650" style="s2">seems to be a lot of playful wording</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:39.380" style="s2">that is also noise like render unto</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.650" end="00:29:41.539" style="s2">that&#39;s noise in my signal would be you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.380" end="00:29:44.539" style="s2">know focus on the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.539" end="00:29:46.730" style="s2">meaningful yeah and let go of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.539" end="00:29:48.140" style="s2">that are not providing value to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.730" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">other one you know so I just would like</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.140" end="00:29:54.230" style="s2">to see a plane you know a planer</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">explained to me like I&#39;m five sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.230" end="00:29:59.539" style="s2">description and one of my other side</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:02.870" style="s2">projects is I bought term dot FYI</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.539" end="00:30:04.520" style="s2">to start a new dictionary because in and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.870" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">I&#39;m just going off on my own projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.520" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">now by the way so this is going good but</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.659" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">in none of the dictionaries you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.010" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">link to a specific definition you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:19.700" style="s2">to link to a word so if I say this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:21.260" style="s2">this is what I mean you then have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.700" end="00:30:25.159" style="s2">tell them oh here go to this link and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.260" end="00:30:27.110" style="s2">then looked at definition five so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.159" end="00:30:29.510" style="s2">turned out fYI is just a page to where</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.110" end="00:30:31.490" style="s2">it&#39;s you can go to a term and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.510" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">could link to a specific definition and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.490" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">that will be up top so that so that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:38.210" style="s2">can wait when you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:42.169" style="s2">conversation then at the end you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.210" end="00:30:44.059" style="s2">just put you know Omega roll - meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.169" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">the second definition of Omega roll not</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.059" end="00:30:49.460" style="s2">the first one we did and gave me 10</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:51.500" style="s2">years ago right would be I think would</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.460" end="00:30:52.539" style="s2">be a helpful thing so just so you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.500" end="00:30:55.669" style="s2">hyperlink to a see</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.539" end="00:30:57.529" style="s2">definition instead of a whole word be</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.529" end="00:31:34.909" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great point so for my term</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.849" end="00:31:36.440" style="s2">dot fYI website I think I will that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.909" end="00:31:39.289" style="s2">think oh I had that to my list of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.440" end="00:31:40.549" style="s2">to do is also have maybe the I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.289" end="00:31:42.440" style="s2">know if they&#39;re called ontology so if</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.549" end="00:31:44.089" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong term but yeah a list of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.440" end="00:31:45.889" style="s2">definitions that are tend to be used</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.089" end="00:31:48.079" style="s2">within a certain context or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.889" end="00:31:50.029" style="s2">group and that would have all the links</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.079" end="00:31:51.709" style="s2">to all the words so people can in in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.029" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">specific ways they&#39;re used in this group</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.709" end="00:31:55.849" style="s2">and maybe a little disambiguation like</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:57.019" style="s2">when people think of sovereignty they</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.849" end="00:31:59.509" style="s2">often mean they think of these five</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.019" end="00:32:02.539" style="s2">things well we mean just this this one</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.509" end="00:32:05.379" style="s2">are these two yeah so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.539" end="00:32:08.029" style="s2">a really good idea I think I had that my</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.379" end="00:32:11.119" style="s2">never-ending to-do list this might also</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.029" end="00:32:12.229" style="s2">be something that is way too maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.119" end="00:32:13.700" style="s2">whole world doesn&#39;t revolve around me</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.229" end="00:32:16.879" style="s2">and everything that&#39;s it need to be so</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.700" end="00:32:18.379" style="s2">it works for me but videos linking to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.879" end="00:32:20.059" style="s2">like the concept being explained right</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.379" end="00:32:22.249" style="s2">like in the inside I make a rule having</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.059" end="00:32:23.479" style="s2">Eric&#39;s video up there because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.249" end="00:32:26.419" style="s2">best one that&#39;s available right now but</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.479" end="00:32:28.309" style="s2">isn&#39;t Jordan and Daniel talking or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.419" end="00:32:30.499" style="s2">something right it&#39;s like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.309" end="00:32:31.849" style="s2">actual or here&#39;s the point where Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.499" end="00:32:34.070" style="s2">and Jordan talk about it right like</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.849" end="00:32:36.349" style="s2">having all of the lists within that to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.070" end="00:32:38.899" style="s2">say here&#39;s how you can get deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.349" end="00:32:40.700" style="s2">this topic but if it&#39;s just a definition</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.899" end="00:32:42.139" style="s2">website that might be like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.700" end="00:32:43.369" style="s2">different website that does that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.139" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">then they always do great together I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.369" end="00:32:48.469" style="s2">think that fits I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:50.509" style="s2">like a phase two yeah because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.469" end="00:32:52.129" style="s2">have the definition but also yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.509" end="00:32:55.459" style="s2">having links to other things and of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.129" end="00:33:00.109" style="s2">course the links could be videos would</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.459" end="00:33:02.659" style="s2">be good videos or links and I also</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.109" end="00:33:04.279" style="s2">wanted to have one one where it where if</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.659" end="00:33:05.779" style="s2">you link to a certain definition like</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.279" end="00:33:06.170" style="s2">we&#39;re using Omega rule it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.779" end="00:33:09.620" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.170" end="00:33:15.170" style="s2">suggested alternatives so if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.620" end="00:33:16.670" style="s2">just a vague term that&#39;s you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.170" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a clear way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.670" end="00:33:23.590" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.990" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">but yeah add videos or links for further</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:30.170" style="s2">reading keep spotting I forgot I looked</p>

<p begin="00:33:48.020" end="00:33:53.000" style="s2">things and I&#39;m kind of realizing that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:55.130" style="s2">my role my role is to literally which</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.000" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">annoys the out of me when everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.130" end="00:33:59.060" style="s2">does it like there&#39;s people who have</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">looked up to in the past like Robert</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.060" end="00:34:02.870" style="s2">Kiyosaki why no longer look up to but</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.130" end="00:34:05.270" style="s2">like I don&#39;t if you don&#39;t eat Rich Dad</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.870" end="00:34:07.270" style="s2">Poor Dad he does business closely and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.270" end="00:34:09.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like learn to do financial planning</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.270" end="00:34:11.750" style="s2">okay in every book is the same this</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.770" end="00:34:12.890" style="s2">four-quadrant like you work here you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.750" end="00:34:14.750" style="s2">an entrepreneur you&#39;re here you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.890" end="00:34:17.390" style="s2">employee it&#39;s like teach people how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.750" end="00:34:19.490" style="s2">actually learn financial language like</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.390" end="00:34:20.870" style="s2">could you do one book to actually tell</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.490" end="00:34:23.149" style="s2">people how to do the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.870" end="00:34:24.409" style="s2">like not there&#39;s a ton of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.149" end="00:34:26.030" style="s2">like this is how we could save the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.409" end="00:34:27.470" style="s2">but they&#39;re just the intellectual piece</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.030" end="00:34:29.960" style="s2">right there like this is what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.470" end="00:34:32.330" style="s2">do um Richard Wolff is that the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.960" end="00:34:33.560" style="s2">who&#39;s like worker cooperatives he&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.330" end="00:34:35.030" style="s2">of working towards doing them but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.560" end="00:34:36.740" style="s2">mainly just like no we need worker</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.030" end="00:34:38.810" style="s2">cooperatives so maybe that is my rule</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.740" end="00:34:42.110" style="s2">but like maybe it is just having the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.810" end="00:34:44.120" style="s2">conversations and because I know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.110" end="00:34:46.340" style="s2">I can&#39;t code and I can&#39;t do that piece</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.120" end="00:34:47.810" style="s2">of it but I can have a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.340" end="00:34:53.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what the idea Cafe is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.810" end="00:34:55.669" style="s2">finding the doing in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:58.700" style="s2">like there&#39;s something there like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.669" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">figuring that piece out yeah we all have</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.700" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2">our different roles and value so our</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:05.180" style="s2">values opponent right horn but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:07.400" style="s2">different things we can contribute and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.180" end="00:35:12.820" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the you know so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.400" end="00:35:15.230" style="s2">passion you have the raw ideas and the</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.670" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">ideas so yes that&#39;s all great value but</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.630" end="00:35:26.089" style="s2">it sounds like you&#39;re willing to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:27.890" style="s2">down into the weeds a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.089" end="00:35:28.970" style="s2">than they are then what you were</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.950" end="00:38:24.579" style="s2">people that can&#39;t make it like that have</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.990" end="00:38:27.039" style="s2">a project or something we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.579" end="00:38:29.160" style="s2">those individual ones out and then I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.039" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">host them you don&#39;t have to be there so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.160" end="00:38:32.589" style="s2">we could tag T pon that and just see how</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">it works but I think just throwing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.589" end="00:38:39.190" style="s2">time out that&#39;s that works for us - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:42.490" style="s2">yeah I know you host you might be</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.759" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">like is basically just that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:52.839" style="s2">conversations but if they one on</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:54.849" style="s2">Saturday becomes that one also it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.839" end="00:38:57.579" style="s2">more yeah on Saturday mornings have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.849" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">meeting with my brother about his</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.579" end="00:39:00.730" style="s2">business ideas that I was helping him</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">with so it&#39;s very similar to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.730" end="00:39:04.329" style="s2">doing with your brother it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:07.859" style="s2">funny although he just had a baby so</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.329" end="00:39:07.859" style="s2">he&#39;s a little preoccupied</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:14.619" style="s2">babies and then hopefully having our</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:16.630" style="s2">first one of that will be in the new</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.619" end="00:39:19.180" style="s2">year but we can probably figure out and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.630" end="00:39:21.759" style="s2">touch base with like people who&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.180" end="00:39:22.809" style="s2">projects like he was fun and asked like</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.759" end="00:39:24.250" style="s2">is this something you&#39;re into and just</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.809" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">posting that on your game face does</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.250" end="00:39:29.140" style="s2">anyone have a project they would like to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:31.319" style="s2">workshop yes and also propose you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.140" end="00:39:33.640" style="s2">my little write-up and just say you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.319" end="00:39:35.019" style="s2">let&#39;s iterate on this if there&#39;s a if</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.640" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">there&#39;s better way to phrase it or if</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.019" end="00:39:38.289" style="s2">there&#39;s better tasks or if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.670" style="s2">better way to organize that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.289" end="00:39:41.349" style="s2">then let us know I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.670" end="00:39:42.970" style="s2">have much feedback but it&#39;s worth giving</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.349" end="00:39:45.250" style="s2">the option and then yeah who all wants</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.970" end="00:39:51.060" style="s2">to be taken opportunity in the hot</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.250" end="00:39:53.620" style="s2">see and that it like that it is about</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.060" end="00:39:55.030" style="s2">you and your project so how hot do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.620" end="00:39:56.140" style="s2">want it to be right do you want to smoke</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.030" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">holes in it do you don&#39;t want to poke</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.140" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">holes in it also just like in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:02.260" style="s2">cafe which I completely oh wait I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:04.420" style="s2">getting better on it forget to be like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:07.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to share for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.420" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">you can pass you can sit and listen and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.120" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">just contribute when you want to write</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:13.300" style="s2">that same like you can pass on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.910" style="s2">question right this isn&#39;t an interview</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.300" end="00:40:17.020" style="s2">like it&#39;s a if I ask you something to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.910" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">poke a hole in and you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.020" end="00:40:20.460" style="s2">answer it doesn&#39;t feel comfortable I</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:24.250" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t need to answer it right</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.460" end="00:40:26.590" style="s2">not that it is or I don&#39;t know I will</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.250" end="00:40:27.580" style="s2">figure that out or like throws back the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.590" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">audience I don&#39;t know what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.580" end="00:40:33.550" style="s2">yeah my solution I think the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:35.050" style="s2">is that these would be recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.550" end="00:40:36.310" style="s2">displayed rather than even happening in</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.050" end="00:40:37.900" style="s2">discussion afterwards because one the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.310" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">main point one of the main values of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.900" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">to the people doing the projects is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:44.200" style="s2">it gets their project out there right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:46.090" style="s2">absolutely if it&#39;s a game be appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.200" end="00:40:49.450" style="s2">project will post on the game B site</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.090" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">after Facebook and post it on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.450" end="00:40:54.370" style="s2">afterwards if they think it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:56.950" style="s2">that&#39;d be kind of the goal if it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.370" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the game B sensibilities and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.950" end="00:41:00.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:03.190" style="s2">this um but just like after the edgy</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.190" end="00:41:05.020" style="s2">cafe yeah we vote on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.190" end="00:41:07.240" style="s2">we&#39;re keeping it whether or not ready to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.020" end="00:41:08.950" style="s2">leave it that maybe instead of voting on</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.240" end="00:41:10.540" style="s2">it cuz that seems weird that the person</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.950" end="00:41:12.280" style="s2">right if it&#39;s your project and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.540" end="00:41:14.080" style="s2">like it was a positive experience and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.280" end="00:41:16.090" style="s2">you&#39;re like yes I want that out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.080" end="00:41:18.070" style="s2">right letting them kind of decide</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.090" end="00:41:20.170" style="s2">whether it&#39;s out there or not and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.070" end="00:41:22.030" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s perfect yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.170" end="00:41:24.610" style="s2">should have an option say oh I just I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.610" end="00:41:29.890" style="s2">just I just rather not confuse people by</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.860" end="00:41:31.810" style="s2">having this out there but I&#39;d be happy</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.890" end="00:41:34.360" style="s2">to do it again with them offense you</p>
