<p begin="00:01:45.020" end="00:01:49.729" style="s2">could start by giving us a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.270" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">your view on like what liminality is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.729" end="00:01:54.530" style="s2">why it&#39;s important and what it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.690" style="s2">with the structure of feeling that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.530" end="00:02:00.260" style="s2">going on underlying this whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.690" end="00:02:02.080" style="s2">meta-crisis sure thank you for first of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.260" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">all having me on today it&#39;s an honor</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">been great to get to know you and get</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.549" end="00:02:13.299" style="s2">familiar with the stoic community a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:19.450" style="s2">of great minds here and great people so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.299" end="00:02:19.450" style="s2">yeah I mean just in terms of housing</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.250" end="00:02:27.139" style="s2">yeah just in terms of how I understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:29.569" style="s2">the term liminality you know obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.139" end="00:02:31.579" style="s2">I&#39;m connecting it to the meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.569" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">modern theme of a structure of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.579" end="00:02:37.489" style="s2">right that&#39;s the that famous essay notes</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:39.889" style="s2">on meta modernism and I was really drawn</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.489" end="00:02:41.780" style="s2">to the concept of Mattacks met at my</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.889" end="00:02:43.909" style="s2">taxi which means sort of being in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.780" end="00:02:46.519" style="s2">between as an ontological state and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.909" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s really something that I explored</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.519" end="00:02:53.319" style="s2">in my cyber USA just talking about meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:56.450" style="s2">and modernism and it really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.319" end="00:02:59.419" style="s2">ontologically expresses the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.450" end="00:03:02.599" style="s2">so much of us have today in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.419" end="00:03:04.780" style="s2">just feeling like so much of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.599" end="00:03:08.620" style="s2">were previously standing on in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.780" end="00:03:11.239" style="s2">institutions forms of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.620" end="00:03:14.389" style="s2">understanding self and world time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.239" end="00:03:16.639" style="s2">space etc are breaking down and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.389" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">no real clear sense of what&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.639" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">through that there&#39;s bits and pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">that but even those bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:25.969" style="s2">right those innovations that were we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:28.519" style="s2">kind of holding with promise also have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.969" end="00:03:30.650" style="s2">kind of a Janus face nature to them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.519" end="00:03:35.209" style="s2">talking about the internet and digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.650" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">technologies and networks etc so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.209" end="00:03:41.329" style="s2">just interesting we&#39;ve seen this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:43.220" style="s2">flux of innovations and then those</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.329" end="00:03:46.579" style="s2">innovations also kind of being captured</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:48.079" style="s2">and exacerbating the crisis at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.579" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">time that they&#39;re also offering some</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.079" end="00:03:52.099" style="s2">kind of promise right so everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:55.220" style="s2">really wrapped up in this promise in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:57.169" style="s2">parellel together and we ourselves I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.220" end="00:04:01.430" style="s2">feel like are in this process of trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.169" end="00:04:03.379" style="s2">to reorient ontologically towards you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.430" end="00:04:07.069" style="s2">know I could get into this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.379" end="00:04:09.979" style="s2">but what is the new ontology that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.069" end="00:04:12.530" style="s2">climate crisis and that this meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.979" end="00:04:15.889" style="s2">is teaching us right because we can take</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.530" end="00:04:18.139" style="s2">in a sort of liminal fashion the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.889" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">issue is the same kind of breakdown and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.139" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">flip that over and consider it from</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">another angle and see what it actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">is teaching us so that&#39;s kind of how I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:28.270" style="s2">understand it but liminality also has</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.940" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">kind of them you know this magical</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:32.810" style="s2">connotation in terms of you know my</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">colleague Daniel Pinchbeck</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.810" end="00:04:37.639" style="s2">talks about this in terms of initiation</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:39.889" style="s2">and sort of being in a transitional or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.639" end="00:04:42.469" style="s2">liminal state as is part of the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.889" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">of transformation right on a both both a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.469" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">cultural and a purse</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:48.540" style="s2">all levels so that it&#39;s it&#39;s factoring</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:50.970" style="s2">that into you into the equation as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.540" end="00:04:52.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s a being in between and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.970" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">structure a feeling of being in between</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.530" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">and then we can get into more details in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:58.470" style="s2">terms of what that phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">actually means like what are those</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">qualities and what is breaking down what</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:08.250" style="s2">is arising but just to start there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if we wanted to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:13.980" style="s2">keep going or if there&#39;s more orienting</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">questions but I could just keep ranting</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.980" end="00:05:18.540" style="s2">about that if you have something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">like alive for you that&#39;s like makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.540" end="00:05:21.980" style="s2">sense to be the next thing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:25.320" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear what you forgot to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.980" end="00:05:27.390" style="s2">I was just gonna mention that that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.320" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">the founding of them of the magazine is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.390" end="00:05:33.420" style="s2">kind of in this of liminal is sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:35.310" style="s2">this extension of you know Daniel was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.420" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">one of the founders of reality sandwich</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:39.750" style="s2">magazine and I&#39;ve always had this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:41.250" style="s2">appreciation for what I call just</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.750" end="00:05:42.810" style="s2">countercultural media account or</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.250" end="00:05:45.420" style="s2">cultural publishing you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.810" end="00:05:49.890" style="s2">disinformation there was the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.420" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">high weirdness of mondo mm and did high</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.890" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">frontiers back in the 80s so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">kind of an interesting counter cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">edge between psychedelia consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:03.390" style="s2">exploration the occult and magic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:05.580" style="s2">then digital utopianism and cyber</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.390" end="00:06:08.190" style="s2">philosophy etc there&#39;s just a long</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.580" end="00:06:10.740" style="s2">history of that and recently you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.190" end="00:06:14.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve just felt and I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.740" end="00:06:16.230" style="s2">sort of also part of like the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.250" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">starting to happen it was just the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.230" end="00:06:20.010" style="s2">time it was just it just seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:22.370" style="s2">the right time to bring this forward and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.010" end="00:06:25.200" style="s2">start talking about innovation solutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.370" end="00:06:27.720" style="s2">side real ways of looking at the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.200" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">and hoping or yielding some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">insight in in that fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.140" end="00:06:39.210" style="s2">um yeah I would actually love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:42.150" style="s2">more about why you think that liminality</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.210" end="00:06:43.470" style="s2">is such an important subject for us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.150" end="00:06:46.410" style="s2">be talking about during the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.470" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">what kind of opportunities do you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.410" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">there are that are like unique to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:54.780" style="s2">unprecedented situation that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:06:57.510" style="s2">liminality is like just Prime&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.780" end="00:07:02.460" style="s2">unlock the potential in oh great</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.510" end="00:07:05.310" style="s2">question great question so a few things</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.460" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">um in one sense and this is what I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.310" end="00:07:09.990" style="s2">mentioned in the essay</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:13.170" style="s2">I think liminality is in some way</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.990" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">intrinsic to the emergent ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.170" end="00:07:19.080" style="s2">what I understand to be sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">integral ontology the ontology of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.080" end="00:07:24.120" style="s2">planetary crisis but also of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:26.640" style="s2">Anthropocene so the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.120" end="00:07:29.760" style="s2">open-ended and process oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.640" end="00:07:31.620" style="s2">involves time as it&#39;s very theme I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:33.870" style="s2">is intrinsic to something that we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.620" end="00:07:37.490" style="s2">to learn as a culture in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.870" end="00:07:41.700" style="s2">complex dynamical systems living systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.490" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">feedback loops I&#39;m very inspired by that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.700" end="00:07:45.540" style="s2">the work of jean gebser who was an</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:47.310" style="s2">integral philosopher in the mid 20th</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.540" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">century and he writes quite profound and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.310" end="00:07:53.010" style="s2">quite precedently about these themes but</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:55.170" style="s2">it also it also shows up in various</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.010" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">philosophies like Tim Martin and hyper</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.170" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">objects an object-oriented ontology so</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:02.640" style="s2">is this theme of being in between is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">actually a kind of mode of being that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.640" end="00:08:08.880" style="s2">are not very used to as a culture in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:10.440" style="s2">terms of inhabiting successfully and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.880" end="00:08:12.540" style="s2">know there&#39;s a couple of essays that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.440" end="00:08:15.780" style="s2">brought on to liminal like I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.540" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">of Matt Segal&#39;s essay towards a guy in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:20.640" style="s2">reality right where he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">Whitehead and process philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.640" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">needing to incorporate a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:27.780" style="s2">process-oriented view of things but what</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">I like it would heat about what he says</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:34.200" style="s2">here right is that this process oriented</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:35.910" style="s2">view is not just something that&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.200" end="00:08:38.790" style="s2">created but he calls it a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.910" end="00:08:42.720" style="s2">cosmological power where we derive our</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.790" end="00:08:44.700" style="s2">human values from so liminality is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.720" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">sort of a gateway concept to begin</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:47.190" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:49.290" style="s2">this different mode of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.190" end="00:08:51.270" style="s2">perception that we really need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.290" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">very quickly and I would also draw from</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.270" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">McLuhan because McLuhan talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:59.370" style="s2">as the kind of um you know when you for</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">him it was he has a different vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.370" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s the sense of needing to bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:06.510" style="s2">all of the different cultural ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">all the different modes of human</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.510" end="00:09:11.400" style="s2">communication have existed across</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:14.010" style="s2">thousands of years a whole human history</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.400" end="00:09:17.580" style="s2">into the forefront being able to access</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.010" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">all of that in a very pliable way and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.580" end="00:09:21.630" style="s2">then needing to almost be simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.970" style="s2">in that sense that the past the present</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.630" end="00:09:26.070" style="s2">and the future are in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.970" end="00:09:27.690" style="s2">coexistent with each other like this the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.070" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">only way to really navigate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.690" end="00:09:32.340" style="s2">planetary complexity is to inhabit that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.610" end="00:09:34.050" style="s2">mode of being somehow and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.340" end="00:09:35.730" style="s2">learning to do that I think that has so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.050" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">much to do with what kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.730" end="00:09:39.690" style="s2">making we&#39;re learning today so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:41.220" style="s2">know if that&#39;s a direct answer but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.690" end="00:09:44.400" style="s2">all has to do with this theme of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:46.260" style="s2">liminality this theme of processes theme</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.400" end="00:09:49.410" style="s2">of temp oryx that i think is just</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.260" end="00:09:55.410" style="s2">absolutely just so essential to start</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.410" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">exploring yeah I think you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.410" end="00:09:58.770" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">um one one thing that comes up for me as</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.770" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">you are kind of like delve into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">more is that we do want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.630" end="00:10:07.830" style="s2">learn these new techniques and like</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.430" end="00:10:11.250" style="s2">broaden our repertoire as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.830" end="00:10:12.840" style="s2">intelligence very quickly and I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.250" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">that one of the things that holds us</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.840" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">back the most from being able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:19.530" style="s2">is like a cultural discomfort with</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:21.330" style="s2">uncertainty I wonder if you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.530" end="00:10:23.340" style="s2">little bit about how we could work with</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.330" end="00:10:25.080" style="s2">liminality and get more comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.340" end="00:10:29.450" style="s2">the sort of uncertainty that it demands</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.080" end="00:10:31.590" style="s2">from us hmm yeah that this is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.450" end="00:10:34.890" style="s2">like Daniel and I talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.590" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">during a live stream with liminal in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:41.100" style="s2">terms of conspiracy theories we want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:45.270" style="s2">and this is I think it&#39;s a very natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.100" end="00:10:48.360" style="s2">reaction to reach for certainty in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.270" end="00:10:50.820" style="s2">time to collapse a Metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.360" end="00:10:53.160" style="s2">understanding into a paranoiac certainty</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.820" end="00:10:55.260" style="s2">right to just kind of go okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.160" end="00:10:57.690" style="s2">really just about this cohort or this</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.260" end="00:10:58.860" style="s2">cabal that&#39;s what&#39;s really going on so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.690" end="00:11:00.930" style="s2">can understand and now</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.860" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">get that and it&#39;s interesting that so</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.930" end="00:11:04.470" style="s2">much of the language around conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.990" style="s2">theories for instance is very often</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.470" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">concerned with sovereignty concerned</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.990" end="00:11:12.510" style="s2">with understanding you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:14.970" style="s2">really going on and waking up so to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.510" end="00:11:17.610" style="s2">like that&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s a very human</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.970" end="00:11:21.270" style="s2">reaction to information overload and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.610" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">complexity but I also think the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.270" end="00:11:25.170" style="s2">again the the medium in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:27.930" style="s2">swimming on the Internet through</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.170" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">Facebook through Twitter we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.930" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">very good at creating these networks but</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.670" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">we aren&#39;t using them we aren&#39;t designing</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:38.010" style="s2">them for coherence we&#39;re designing them</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:40.020" style="s2">for fragmentation and there&#39;s ACMA</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.010" end="00:11:41.280" style="s2">socio-economic incentives for that as</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.020" end="00:11:43.950" style="s2">well that like let&#39;s say Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.280" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">rushkoff talks about so the media in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.950" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">which we&#39;re swimming in is engendering</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:51.330" style="s2">this overwhelm right and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:53.940" style="s2">are reaching for certainty in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.330" end="00:11:55.800" style="s2">so how do we read how do we get more</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.940" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">comfortable with uncertainty I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:12:01.170" style="s2">part of this is recognizing those</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:03.210" style="s2">compulsions and desires for certainty as</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.170" end="00:12:05.280" style="s2">we&#39;re navigating these media spaces you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.210" end="00:12:07.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a very internal work</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.280" end="00:12:09.810" style="s2">right now but it shouldn&#39;t just be that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.710" end="00:12:12.150" style="s2">you know like what we really need to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.810" end="00:12:16.050" style="s2">doing is designing these spaces with</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.150" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">coherence and human centric principles</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.050" end="00:12:21.630" style="s2">in mind and many different theorists are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:24.030" style="s2">talking about that I think I would bring</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.630" end="00:12:27.030" style="s2">up Michele ballons who&#39;s on liminal as</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.030" end="00:12:29.280" style="s2">well sort of discussing how to better</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.030" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">utilize peer-to-peer networks and design</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.280" end="00:12:33.510" style="s2">them not only socially but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">economically he talks about the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.510" end="00:12:38.520" style="s2">etc and he has he has a fantastic essay</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:41.580" style="s2">on unlimite Laswell that&#39;s a very kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.520" end="00:12:43.890" style="s2">of gap serían take it&#39;s called Corona in</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.580" end="00:12:45.810" style="s2">the Commons and that&#39;s sort of again</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.890" end="00:12:48.630" style="s2">more of the macro perspective of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.810" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">going on but at the heart of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.630" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2">what he&#39;s talking about is is really</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.490" end="00:12:55.860" style="s2">trying to learn what he calls a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:58.440" style="s2">pedagogical catastrophe like take what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.860" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">going on and really kind of read into</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.440" end="00:13:05.610" style="s2">you so a crisis teaches us what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:08.310" style="s2">haven&#39;t been looking at right so how are</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.610" end="00:13:09.540" style="s2">we falling how are we collapsing what</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.310" end="00:13:11.890" style="s2">are the stressors and what are they</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.540" end="00:13:14.470" style="s2">actually teaching us you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.890" end="00:13:17.860" style="s2">and I bring this into in the terms of in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.470" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">terms of liminality you know liminality</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.860" end="00:13:23.290" style="s2">is a different mode of time you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s disruptive in the sense that just</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.290" end="00:13:27.270" style="s2">like the pandemic and just like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:29.710" style="s2">protests that are going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.270" end="00:13:33.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain intensity that comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.710" end="00:13:35.800" style="s2">to the forefront and especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.520" end="00:13:39.690" style="s2">pandemic the discussion was centered</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.800" end="00:13:43.090" style="s2">around this sort of pausing right this</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.690" end="00:13:45.160" style="s2">release from the forward motion of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.090" end="00:13:47.310" style="s2">culture right the momentum of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.160" end="00:13:50.530" style="s2">forward motion of the machine of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.310" end="00:13:53.380" style="s2">capitalism suddenly it stops and as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.530" end="00:13:55.720" style="s2">disaster for that machine right so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:58.150" style="s2">begin to ask well why can&#39;t we stop why</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:14:00.450" style="s2">can&#39;t there be a steady-state why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.150" end="00:14:02.620" style="s2">there be pauses in that forward momentum</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.450" end="00:14:04.750" style="s2">different types of rhythm different</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.620" end="00:14:06.520" style="s2">types of time and of course what goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.750" end="00:14:09.250" style="s2">along with those is different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.520" end="00:14:11.890" style="s2">being in the world so I think the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.250" end="00:14:16.450" style="s2">of radical inquiries that we can make in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.890" end="00:14:18.850" style="s2">this crisis are in some sense providing</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.450" end="00:14:20.770" style="s2">profoundly valuable insights into you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.850" end="00:14:23.950" style="s2">okay how do we live in an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.770" end="00:14:25.450" style="s2">way right how do we actually step out or</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.950" end="00:14:28.300" style="s2">actually imagine something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.450" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">capitalism right and it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.300" end="00:14:36.130" style="s2">something that we&#39;re exploring at a at</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:37.780" style="s2">liminal as well right I think that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.130" end="00:14:39.730" style="s2">of aspects of the meta crisis are things</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.780" end="00:14:41.590" style="s2">that we really wouldn&#39;t have been able</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.730" end="00:14:44.230" style="s2">to contemplate before it happened and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.590" end="00:14:47.590" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to me um usually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.230" end="00:14:49.900" style="s2">cautionary tale is something that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.590" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">the characters in the story leave behind</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.900" end="00:14:54.010" style="s2">for the people after to try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:56.110" style="s2">understand and do something different</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.010" end="00:14:58.390" style="s2">but there&#39;s this strange way that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.110" end="00:15:00.760" style="s2">pandemic has given us a pause where we</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.390" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">the characters in a cautionary tale can</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.760" end="00:15:05.350" style="s2">stop and think about what we might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">cautioned about in the tale and see if</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.350" end="00:15:09.580" style="s2">we can make a better decision for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:11.980" style="s2">people already in it rather than waiting</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.580" end="00:15:14.920" style="s2">for the next generation to try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.980" end="00:15:19.990" style="s2">understand what this all means um what</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.920" end="00:15:24.449" style="s2">do you think we can do right now to stay</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.990" end="00:15:27.629" style="s2">open with out like</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.449" end="00:15:29.819" style="s2">having too broad of a scope there there</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.629" end="00:15:33.499" style="s2">is so much information there is such an</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.819" end="00:15:37.859" style="s2">opportunity to be overwhelmed how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.499" end="00:15:41.399" style="s2">be more expansive and more exclusive at</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.859" end="00:15:42.929" style="s2">the same time yeah great question well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.399" end="00:15:46.499" style="s2">think that the first thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.929" end="00:15:48.660" style="s2">mentioned is something I take from</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.499" end="00:15:50.999" style="s2">McLuhan all the time I use it at the end</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.660" end="00:15:52.739" style="s2">of my side-view essay or he&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.999" end="00:15:54.089" style="s2">suddenly need to be aware of everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.739" end="00:15:55.829" style="s2">that is going to happen and all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.089" end="00:15:58.199" style="s2">consequences of what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.829" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">before it happens and that&#39;s just how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.199" end="00:16:03.329" style="s2">have to navigate the present now I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">that is such a great and he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.329" end="00:16:07.259" style="s2">about that in like the sixties or</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:10.199" style="s2">seventies right so I think that is such</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.259" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">a great way of thinking of okay how what</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.199" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">is the mode of sense making for human</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:18.239" style="s2">beings living in the 21st century it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:20.279" style="s2">this different sense of time and system</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.239" end="00:16:22.919" style="s2">in ecology in terms of seeing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.279" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">field of relations but you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.919" end="00:16:28.049" style="s2">there can be kind of an overwhelmed with</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:30.449" style="s2">this right the overwhelm is is well what</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.049" end="00:16:32.220" style="s2">is the coherence right is it a meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.449" end="00:16:34.199" style="s2">system that I need to follow is it a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.220" end="00:16:36.539" style="s2">meta fury that can help me navigate this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.199" end="00:16:38.609" style="s2">is it just this structure of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.539" end="00:16:40.199" style="s2">right but I think we can actually unpack</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.609" end="00:16:42.179" style="s2">that structure feeling a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.199" end="00:16:44.269" style="s2">without needing to create a singular</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.179" end="00:16:47.189" style="s2">system or singular narrative</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.269" end="00:16:51.059" style="s2">what would I go to you anyway is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.189" end="00:16:53.639" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s so I think part of this has</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.059" end="00:16:56.249" style="s2">to do with cultivating a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.639" end="00:16:59.999" style="s2">artistic sensitivity to the present in</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.249" end="00:17:02.489" style="s2">understanding where we want to get to in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.999" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">terms of a better world out of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.489" end="00:17:07.139" style="s2">crisis navigating out but then also what</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">the crisis is actually showing us what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.139" end="00:17:11.880" style="s2">that better world can be and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:13.860" style="s2">something that is utopian in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.880" end="00:17:16.529" style="s2">traditional sense of I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.860" end="00:17:18.659" style="s2">abstractly conceive of a better planet</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.529" end="00:17:21.149" style="s2">we&#39;re all peaceful but rather let me</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.659" end="00:17:23.279" style="s2">really listen to the present and really</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.149" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">listen to the crisis in that pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.279" end="00:17:27.779" style="s2">sense and hear what it is showing us</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:31.399" style="s2">right so it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s revealing</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.779" end="00:17:34.049" style="s2">us as a revealing to us the need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.399" end="00:17:36.929" style="s2">entering into different modes of time</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.049" end="00:17:37.800" style="s2">and space to be pliable to be adaptable</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.929" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.800" end="00:17:42.930" style="s2">draw from David Graeber a lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">sense of um he talks about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.930" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">early human societies and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:50.070" style="s2">Paleolithic would would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:51.780" style="s2">quite dynamic they would be totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.070" end="00:17:53.580" style="s2">in one season and then they would flip</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.780" end="00:17:55.740" style="s2">it become a gala terian in the other and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.580" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">agrarian society sometimes would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.740" end="00:18:00.270" style="s2">profoundly egalitarian rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">hierarchical so the question of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.270" end="00:18:04.800" style="s2">of the historical question for us is why</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">have we become so fixed and we clearly</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.800" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">can&#39;t be fixed anymore we have to become</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.850" style="s2">dynamic socially politically</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:14.100" style="s2">economically we have to be pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.850" end="00:18:17.610" style="s2">and I think part of the problem is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.100" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">become so rigidify door fixated on that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.610" end="00:18:23.250" style="s2">again that very forward motion the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:26.520" style="s2">ideological economic industrial forward</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.250" end="00:18:28.050" style="s2">motion so what can engender a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.520" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">kind of culture that isn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.050" end="00:18:32.610" style="s2">right the crisis is showing us that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">is what is being called forth in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.610" end="00:18:39.900" style="s2">moment and then I use this as a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:43.370" style="s2">frame of reference but bruno latour</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.900" end="00:18:47.100" style="s2">talks about in his book down-to-earth</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.370" end="00:18:49.980" style="s2">the arc of modernity is over right I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.100" end="00:18:51.780" style="s2">in that sense is has completed itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.980" end="00:18:54.150" style="s2">there is no more forward motion and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.780" end="00:18:56.070" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s talking about that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.150" end="00:18:59.370" style="s2">let&#39;s continue with progress or let&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.070" end="00:19:01.350" style="s2">go back to a better time is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.370" end="00:19:03.540" style="s2">stuck in this oscillation that is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.350" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">flinging out of this world and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.540" end="00:19:07.620" style="s2">really going on the new ontology and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:09.540" style="s2">new subject is being reoriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.620" end="00:19:11.820" style="s2">the terrestrial those are the coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.540" end="00:19:14.750" style="s2">down to earth so I think any of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.820" end="00:19:18.450" style="s2">processes that are going hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.750" end="00:19:22.170" style="s2">humans have these innate tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.450" end="00:19:24.590" style="s2">towards mutual aid life and nature is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.170" end="00:19:27.180" style="s2">process of symbiogenesis right</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.590" end="00:19:30.840" style="s2">cooperation and a making with simple</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.180" end="00:19:32.850" style="s2">ASIS and the climate crisis is forcing</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.840" end="00:19:34.500" style="s2">us to recognize that and realize that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.850" end="00:19:37.830" style="s2">is the ultimate coming down to earth</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.500" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">becoming terrestrial and the more our</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.830" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">politics and our social systems and our</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:45.390" style="s2">social imaginary can go in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:46.980" style="s2">direction come back down to earth I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.390" end="00:19:49.500" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good coherence that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.980" end="00:19:51.690" style="s2">good principle you guys have had on Joe</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.500" end="00:19:54.269" style="s2">Brewers work I think what he&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.690" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">example like how do we live as a society</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.269" end="00:20:00.090" style="s2">post capitalism what kind of economics</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.480" end="00:20:02.940" style="s2">what kind of literacy in terms of bio</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.090" end="00:20:04.500" style="s2">regionalism are we going to need what</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.940" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">does a post-capitalist future actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.500" end="00:20:09.659" style="s2">look like right so I think there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:11.340" style="s2">different expressions of that but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.659" end="00:20:14.009" style="s2">think we can at least go here around</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.340" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">this is this is certainly like what</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.009" end="00:20:18.779" style="s2">Jordan Hall is talking about like as big</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.779" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">Renaissance or Industrial Revolution but</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.639" end="00:20:26.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of a counter it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:28.379" style="s2">reversal and so any of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.490" end="00:20:31.049" style="s2">themes I think can really help us go</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.379" end="00:20:32.610" style="s2">here the massive complexity of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.049" end="00:20:35.669" style="s2">going on and actually kind of lean into</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:37.950" style="s2">certain tendencies that are not abstract</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.669" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">they&#39;re concrete these this is the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.950" end="00:20:43.649" style="s2">you know this is the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:44.879" style="s2">gravitational pull of the present but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.649" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">has to begin with the structure or</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.879" end="00:20:50.009" style="s2">feeling like like I talked about in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:52.169" style="s2">essay or else we&#39;re just going to meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.009" end="00:20:55.710" style="s2">ourselves out of this world like bruno</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.169" end="00:20:57.809" style="s2">latour warns us about so let&#39;s go here</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.710" end="00:20:59.639" style="s2">but cohere by listening to the present</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.809" end="00:21:02.039" style="s2">and listening to what the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.639" end="00:21:03.779" style="s2">actually showing us how to be it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.039" end="00:21:05.309" style="s2">it&#39;s not that difficult but it also is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.779" end="00:21:08.009" style="s2">profoundly difficult because I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.309" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">we&#39;re we find it difficult as moderns to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.009" end="00:21:12.840" style="s2">do that right let alone you know with</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">the kind of momentum our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.840" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">has that is acting against this so yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:25.139" style="s2">long story short we have to listen and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:26.929" style="s2">be present I think awesome I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.139" end="00:21:29.309" style="s2">you one more question before I start</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.929" end="00:21:32.039" style="s2">calling on people who are putting their</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.309" end="00:21:33.929" style="s2">questions in the chat to give you their</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.039" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">questions um for you guys who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.929" end="00:21:37.590" style="s2">putting questions in the chat just so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:39.450" style="s2">you know this is being recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.590" end="00:21:41.909" style="s2">maybe posted on YouTube so if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.450" end="00:21:44.940" style="s2">prefer for me to read your question for</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.909" end="00:21:46.679" style="s2">you just leave some sort of an indicator</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.940" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">along with your question and I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.679" end="00:21:52.230" style="s2">to do that um so yeah I Jeremy my last</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:53.970" style="s2">question for you before I pass things</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:58.110" style="s2">off to the collective intelligence a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.970" end="00:22:00.779" style="s2">more is how do you think the myth of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.110" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">stability that has existed around our</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.779" end="00:22:05.350" style="s2">social institutions has created like</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">blind spots that are very you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.350" end="00:22:11.770" style="s2">to this generation mm-hmm the myth of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:15.370" style="s2">stability I mean you know I think this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.770" end="00:22:18.669" style="s2">is something you know it&#39;s unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.370" end="00:22:20.679" style="s2">that I talked about this right as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.669" end="00:22:23.020" style="s2">pandemic was starting like people</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.679" end="00:22:25.929" style="s2">started talking about supply chains and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.020" end="00:22:28.419" style="s2">growing gardens and like more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.929" end="00:22:31.450" style="s2">people like that the what was seeing as</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.419" end="00:22:33.160" style="s2">some hippy utopianism right like okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.450" end="00:22:36.460" style="s2">yeah there could be a better world but</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.160" end="00:22:39.580" style="s2">the the realism of this world is such</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.460" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">that those things are nice ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.580" end="00:22:44.140" style="s2">might kind of work their way into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:46.690" style="s2">center gradually we&#39;re suddenly in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.140" end="00:22:50.409" style="s2">disruptive moment where the center is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.690" end="00:22:53.799" style="s2">just falls out from beneath us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.409" end="00:22:57.429" style="s2">stability it&#39;s it&#39;s concretion is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.799" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">completely in question so the the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.429" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">cynical remark about this it&#39;s is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:05.650" style="s2">it seems that until the the ground</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:07.990" style="s2">beneath us falls out in this way the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.650" end="00:23:11.650" style="s2">that we are living through right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.990" end="00:23:14.789" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it remains an abstraction it</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.650" end="00:23:18.490" style="s2">remains a hypothesis it remains a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.789" end="00:23:20.169" style="s2">daydream or a reverie of the culture to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.490" end="00:23:22.299" style="s2">imagine itself in a better place but</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.169" end="00:23:24.070" style="s2">when that stability falls out it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.299" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">false stability and it always has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.070" end="00:23:27.880" style="s2">it&#39;s been very tenuous but when that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:31.330" style="s2">falls out I think that&#39;s when we begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.880" end="00:23:34.630" style="s2">to intensify and give permission to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.330" end="00:23:36.700" style="s2">actually rethink the center but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.630" end="00:23:38.440" style="s2">very helpful when we have better</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.700" end="00:23:39.970" style="s2">coherence about what this new center</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:43.299" style="s2">could be so I would say there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.970" end="00:23:46.419" style="s2">kind of reversal where the previously</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.299" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">utopian and more beautiful world you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.419" end="00:23:50.380" style="s2">know that Charles Eisenstein talks about</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:50.860" style="s2">is suddenly like oh that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.380" end="00:23:52.360" style="s2">be great</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.860" end="00:23:54.520" style="s2">right now it&#39;d be good to have a back-up</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.360" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">plan for my family because I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.520" end="00:23:59.740" style="s2">or if I could get bread or if gas goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:01.929" style="s2">out or if a supply chain goes out in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.740" end="00:24:03.970" style="s2">next coming years you know it would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.929" end="00:24:06.549" style="s2">great to have some kind of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:08.860" style="s2">and resilient plan and I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.549" end="00:24:12.490" style="s2">the kind of things as the system systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.860" end="00:24:15.280" style="s2">buckle and collapse the innovations come</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.490" end="00:24:16.780" style="s2">forward like you know we saw this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.280" end="00:24:18.860" style="s2">happening in real time the United States</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.780" end="00:24:21.950" style="s2">where the federal answer to the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.860" end="00:24:24.409" style="s2">was no longer being addressed in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.950" end="00:24:26.840" style="s2">of coherence and so local regional</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.409" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">almost Commonwealth started arising</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.840" end="00:24:32.659" style="s2">about like how to strategize reopening</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:36.200" style="s2">or not or how to source the the medical</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.659" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">supplies that they needed so on the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:40.220" style="s2">hand this seems like fragmentation but</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.140" style="s2">on the other again if we take this theme</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:44.779" style="s2">of a perspective &#39;ti that gaps your</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.140" end="00:24:48.110" style="s2">talks about or Latour is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.779" end="00:24:49.750" style="s2">with the terrestrial that there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.110" end="00:24:52.610" style="s2">better answer in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.750" end="00:24:56.899" style="s2">nation-states are perhaps not the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.610" end="00:24:59.240" style="s2">expression of a planetary polity you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.899" end="00:25:01.340" style="s2">know and decentralization is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.240" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">that we actually have to learn now for</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.340" end="00:25:04.370" style="s2">the first time we&#39;re doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:07.789" style="s2">networks and digital culture and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.370" end="00:25:09.889" style="s2">communications but have we really really</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.789" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">reworked society at that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.889" end="00:25:14.409" style="s2">level we&#39;re still using you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:17.450" style="s2">know a thousand two thousand year old</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.409" end="00:25:19.370" style="s2">institutions to think about planetary</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.450" end="00:25:21.380" style="s2">dynamics maybe those don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.370" end="00:25:23.690" style="s2">maybe our institutions need to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.380" end="00:25:25.190" style="s2">the network&#39;s that were communicating in</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.690" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">and the living systems that were</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a bigger like well holy crap</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.419" end="00:25:33.710" style="s2">that&#39;s like a that&#39;s not just a</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.710" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">ontologically as profound as as what</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.070" end="00:25:41.630" style="s2">morton talks about with the the</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.630" end="00:25:46.010" style="s2">and the nature becoming human and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.090" end="00:25:47.389" style="s2">is also something that I think both</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.010" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">McLuhan and gaps are talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.389" end="00:25:51.860" style="s2">their own ways but gaps are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:55.090" style="s2">really talks about transparency the</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.090" end="00:26:01.100" style="s2">are finally being overcome but the</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.740" end="00:26:09.230" style="s2">we outlive the crisis or will it outlive</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:12.260" style="s2">us and that is immediately and directly</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.230" end="00:26:14.059" style="s2">related to what we can draw from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.260" end="00:26:16.870" style="s2">going on right now how deeply we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.059" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">listen and cohere and respond to it um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.870" end="00:26:22.190" style="s2">you know that was a great question</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:23.690" style="s2">though I mean this is the question right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.190" end="00:26:26.810" style="s2">this is the question are all trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.690" end="00:26:29.280" style="s2">figure out and entertain right now</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.309" end="00:28:30.250" style="s2">or uncertainty people are saying like</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.970" end="00:28:37.630" style="s2">so how would you respond to that because</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.669" end="00:28:39.640" style="s2">I do agree with you I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.630" end="00:28:41.590" style="s2">very very important task how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.640" end="00:28:43.269" style="s2">cultivate a great relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.590" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">liminality uncertainty and all this</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.269" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">stuff but at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:51.640" style="s2">respond to the medic Rice&#39;s and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.320" style="s2">negotiate those relationships if people</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.640" end="00:28:55.710" style="s2">are coming to you and you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.320" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">gas lighting you to take their position</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.710" end="00:29:00.580" style="s2">good question and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:03.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.580" end="00:29:06.809" style="s2">of some of Kepler&#39;s insights on because</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.940" end="00:29:08.889" style="s2">he he has a sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.809" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">understanding of this unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.889" end="00:29:13.659" style="s2">consciousness with different structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:16.110" style="s2">and they all kind of still play out in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.659" end="00:29:19.809" style="s2">very interesting dynamics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.110" end="00:29:22.480" style="s2">totalization and oppositional ism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.809" end="00:29:25.269" style="s2">this hyper fragmentation that are that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.480" end="00:29:30.370" style="s2">are again our networks are engendering</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.269" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">to a great extent is unfortunate but in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.370" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">terms of how to react or how to respond</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:40.750" style="s2">or cohere with that um I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:43.090" style="s2">liminality means not acting or not being</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.750" end="00:29:46.750" style="s2">comfortable taking an action that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.090" end="00:29:49.269" style="s2">would be perceived as a side I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.750" end="00:29:51.730" style="s2">real capacity to be liminal is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.269" end="00:29:53.799" style="s2">actually kind of say yeah I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.730" end="00:29:56.710" style="s2">that or yes I&#39;ll take the stance with</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.799" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">you and still render it transparent in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.710" end="00:30:01.630" style="s2">sense like I&#39;m gonna engage with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:03.970" style="s2">ethically morally because we should and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.630" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">we ought to I don&#39;t agree with the kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:09.370" style="s2">of totalizing way you&#39;re coming down on</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:11.559" style="s2">that but I do agree that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.370" end="00:30:13.389" style="s2">expressing something let&#39;s say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.559" end="00:30:16.450" style="s2">know let&#39;s go protest right let&#39;s go out</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.389" end="00:30:18.940" style="s2">right now let&#39;s join we feel our hearts</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.450" end="00:30:21.250" style="s2">are calling us to go down and do so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.940" end="00:30:23.529" style="s2">somebody says you have to do it whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.250" end="00:30:25.389" style="s2">you know like but go ahead and do it if</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.529" end="00:30:27.669" style="s2">you feel called to do it right like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.389" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">think this shouldn&#39;t hinder us from</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.669" end="00:30:32.529" style="s2">having action and then also rendering</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:34.779" style="s2">those actions transparent the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.529" end="00:30:37.030" style="s2">larger medicines that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.779" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">about here right like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.030" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">I very often talk about this whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:46.330" style="s2">election cycle and during the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:49.690" style="s2">right there are certain policies there</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.330" end="00:30:51.250" style="s2">are certain legislative policies that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.690" end="00:30:53.710" style="s2">are being enacted and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.250" end="00:30:55.660" style="s2">polarized in terms of the political</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.710" end="00:30:58.690" style="s2">landscape nevertheless I think it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.660" end="00:31:00.940" style="s2">to enact and participate without feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.690" end="00:31:02.710" style="s2">like we&#39;re you know in that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.940" end="00:31:04.540" style="s2">being in the world but not of it you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.710" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">just have to go forth and do what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.540" end="00:31:09.670" style="s2">got to do you know so I think for us the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">harder part is to participate without</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.670" end="00:31:17.560" style="s2">getting stuck or without acquiring the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:19.210" style="s2">totalizing perspectives that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.560" end="00:31:21.550" style="s2">crop up everywhere right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.210" end="00:31:23.980" style="s2">navigate that it&#39;s very difficult we</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.550" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">have to in a sense be mediators and also</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.980" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">in another sense we have to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:33.040" style="s2">attempting to cohere and render</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:35.590" style="s2">transparent this larger process and why</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.040" end="00:31:37.770" style="s2">we&#39;re acting and I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.590" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">difficult task because again our</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.770" end="00:31:43.450" style="s2">communication media is just encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.290" end="00:31:46.230" style="s2">us to take a totalizing viewpoint right</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.450" end="00:31:49.390" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s wanting us to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.230" end="00:31:51.940" style="s2">complexity into yes or no</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.390" end="00:31:55.000" style="s2">can we still say yes or no can we still</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.940" end="00:31:57.640" style="s2">act and not collapse into that mentality</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.000" end="00:31:59.410" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult right I think this</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.640" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">is at least the start of what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.410" end="00:32:06.040" style="s2">do right like you guys have had a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:07.540" style="s2">Michael Brooks on and you know Michael</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.040" end="00:32:09.460" style="s2">books is a good is a good friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.540" end="00:32:12.400" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about this before too</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.460" end="00:32:15.010" style="s2">in that sense of you know absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.400" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">these sort of meta processes are really</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.010" end="00:32:18.490" style="s2">important and there&#39;s something you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:21.490" style="s2">do right now and actually maybe by</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.490" end="00:32:23.500" style="s2">participating in that and leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.490" end="00:32:25.900" style="s2">window open to these sort of more macro</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.500" end="00:32:27.430" style="s2">meta perspectives in the communities</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.900" end="00:32:28.300" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging with that are very hyper</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.430" end="00:32:29.950" style="s2">polarized</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.300" end="00:32:31.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe some of them will</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.950" end="00:32:33.040" style="s2">come on board with that and be more</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.330" end="00:32:34.840" style="s2">interested in that because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.040" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">bigger coherence right there&#39;s a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.840" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:42.760" style="s2">before a larger sense of the process</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.980" style="s2">that&#39;s happening and how they&#39;re a part</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.760" end="00:32:46.150" style="s2">of it you know like say yes to them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.980" end="00:32:48.790" style="s2">show them that they&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">something that&#39;s just more than you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.790" end="00:32:52.650" style="s2">the entrenchment of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:58.560" style="s2">medic Wars right easier said than done</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.650" end="00:33:02.090" style="s2">but I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see an end what</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.560" end="00:33:05.040" style="s2">do you call it a kind of arrest between</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.090" end="00:33:08.550" style="s2">taking an action with a perceived stance</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.040" end="00:33:11.640" style="s2">and still being in this liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.550" end="00:33:17.970" style="s2">right if that makes sense</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.580" end="00:33:43.110" style="s2">features of anarchism have pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:45.450" style="s2">that conspiracy theorizing is more</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.110" end="00:33:48.120" style="s2">common among people without college</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.450" end="00:33:50.250" style="s2">education and then on the flip side of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.120" end="00:33:52.200" style="s2">that we see sort of a cadet a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.250" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">credentialism that appears in people</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.200" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">with college degrees where they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">have a habit of thinking that if</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:33:59.700" style="s2">something was published in a journal or</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:03.300" style="s2">it comes in a fancy packaging with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.700" end="00:34:05.310" style="s2">of acronyms and stuff that it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.300" end="00:34:07.260" style="s2">it seems like both of those placeholders</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.310" end="00:34:12.510" style="s2">are there to avoid saying I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.260" end="00:34:15.179" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering if your project is in</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.830" end="00:34:21.419" style="s2">while still being productive in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.300" end="00:34:23.970" style="s2">world yeah great question and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.419" end="00:34:26.760" style="s2">also a great way to kind of also respond</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.970" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">to Peters inquiry to like I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">know right I think that&#39;s very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.560" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">to frame it that way but yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">think so I mean you know Daniel and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:44.429" style="s2">talked about this in terms of like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:47.850" style="s2">part of liminal Zoll as as a media space</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.429" end="00:34:50.880" style="s2">in the consciousness culture could be to</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.190" end="00:35:05.880" style="s2">some kind of validity right our own</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.880" end="00:35:12.060" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s no easy answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.810" end="00:35:13.740" style="s2">but one of the things I do remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.060" end="00:35:16.290" style="s2">actually from that from that particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.740" end="00:35:19.140" style="s2">book is that you know sometimes and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.290" end="00:35:20.450" style="s2">is something Brooks mentions as well by</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.140" end="00:35:24.090" style="s2">way of William Aaron Thompson but</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.450" end="00:35:26.040" style="s2">sometimes conspiracy theories can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.090" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">very interesting if we flip them again</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.040" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">and look at what they&#39;re actually you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:33.740" style="s2">know implicitly talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:35.850" style="s2">they may be caricatures are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.740" end="00:35:38.310" style="s2">two-dimensional expressions of a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.850" end="00:35:40.470" style="s2">multi-dimensional and complex process of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.310" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">power dynamics but they might reveal</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.470" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">something actually about those power</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">dynamics in a way that is accessible</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.250" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">right and almost folkloric so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:51.420" style="s2">ways in which we can even be friendly to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:54.450" style="s2">these narratives and think about them in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:56.700" style="s2">a way that um no I don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.450" end="00:35:58.290" style="s2">just this is just how I&#39;ve approached it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.700" end="00:35:59.700" style="s2">in the past I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.290" end="00:36:02.610" style="s2">conspiracy theorists would appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.700" end="00:36:04.590" style="s2">being interpreted in this way and sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.610" end="00:36:07.800" style="s2">of almost innocence psychologize din</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.590" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">this way but nevertheless I think they</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:13.350" style="s2">do express something about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">on and it should be addressed it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.350" end="00:36:17.550" style="s2">sort of done in a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:20.100" style="s2">literalized fashion and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.550" end="00:36:22.140" style="s2">again hold that lightly and not go along</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.100" end="00:36:23.970" style="s2">with the literal isms maybe we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.140" end="00:36:26.700" style="s2">something from a particular conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.970" end="00:36:29.880" style="s2">theory about I don&#39;t know the flagger</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.700" end="00:36:32.460" style="s2">there&#39;s something along those lines I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.880" end="00:36:35.400" style="s2">just bringing up flat-earthers as one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.460" end="00:36:37.140" style="s2">the more extreme examples but for them</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.400" end="00:36:39.870" style="s2">even you know I think that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.140" end="00:36:41.610" style="s2">desire to return to a measurable world</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.870" end="00:36:44.100" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.610" end="00:36:47.640" style="s2">a world that can enclose themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.100" end="00:36:49.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of a loss of world right</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.640" end="00:36:52.590" style="s2">now it would be very good if we could go</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.350" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">back in to the enclosure of the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.590" end="00:36:57.960" style="s2">unperceptive all dome that they often</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:59.790" style="s2">talk about so you know these things can</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.960" end="00:37:02.850" style="s2">tell us more about our own human</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.790" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">compulsions and desires and we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.850" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">sympathise with them but um I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:08.220" style="s2">if that&#39;s a direct answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:10.340" style="s2">question though but uh that was a good</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.460" end="00:37:52.910" style="s2">yeah so I think we have to of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.450" end="00:37:55.460" style="s2">think about this in well in in this</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">talks about this as well many different</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.900" end="00:38:46.040" style="s2">theorists talk about this right the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:49.640" style="s2">sense of the buffering of the self that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.040" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">emerges through this this newfound</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:02.869" style="s2">there&#39;s a cutting off of participation</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.630" end="00:39:05.540" style="s2">in these other modes of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.869" end="00:39:07.730" style="s2">you know pre-modern times had and then</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.170" end="00:39:43.310" style="s2">seems to be running away right history</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.420" end="00:39:54.110" style="s2">twentieth-century theorists talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.220" end="00:39:54.860" style="s2">this feeling of kind of being a</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.320" end="00:40:01.610" style="s2">recess like we&#39;re in a howling wind</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.910" end="00:40:04.550" style="s2">tunnel right and we no longer live in in</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.610" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">a present with a sufficient now to stand</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.550" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">on it&#39;s just sort of crisis management</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:12.680" style="s2">so this in the same freedom of self is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.750" style="s2">also this same feeling of powerlessness</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.680" end="00:40:17.060" style="s2">of the forces that that self is</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.770" end="00:42:07.370" style="s2">answers are appearing in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.420" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">different modalities all these different</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:51.800" style="s2">that has to do with being human again</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.160" end="00:42:54.860" style="s2">again the pandemic allowed us to take a</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.340" end="00:43:41.720" style="s2">complicated question about what the</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.720" end="00:43:49.910" style="s2">how that is very kind of limited right</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.380" end="00:43:51.290" style="s2">or fragmented in that sense I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.910" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">if that if that directly answered that</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">I got a thumbs up from Ron so it looks</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.780" end="00:44:01.790" style="s2">like we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:04.280" style="s2">yeah absolute poetry to me III would</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.210" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">who else has a question um Bart it looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.790" end="00:44:35.900" style="s2">like you also had a question for Jeremy</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:43.850" style="s2">if you&#39;d like to I&#39;m here yourself yep</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.900" end="00:44:44.420" style="s2">hey Jeremy so I heard you mention for</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.850" end="00:44:46.730" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.420" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">you put a Rudolf Steiner quote in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.730" end="00:44:57.800" style="s2">chat yesterday and I&#39;ve heard you you</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:59.810" style="s2">know talking about the idea of reversal</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.800" end="00:45:04.820" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of an image that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.810" end="00:45:09.110" style="s2">sitting with for a while no but if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.820" end="00:45:13.240" style="s2">noticed that the the anthroposophical</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.110" end="00:45:19.130" style="s2">kind of thread of thought is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.240" end="00:45:25.540" style="s2">somehow not finding its way to the game</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.130" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">be conversation and just thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.540" end="00:45:36.650" style="s2">about the idea of the see if I can do</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">this in a good way like the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.650" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">reversal of the fo&#39;c&#39;sle and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:56.330" style="s2">this mimetic tribes as like having the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:59.780" style="s2">potential to be game be communities and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.330" end="00:46:03.890" style="s2">what what somebody recently told me that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.780" end="00:46:06.370" style="s2">Steiner referred to as new Mike I Alec</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.890" end="00:46:06.370" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.580" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">yeah good question I am relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.540" end="00:46:16.190" style="s2">to the game B communities like so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:17.750" style="s2">don&#39;t really know the ins and the outs</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.190" end="00:46:20.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve really just been exposed a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.750" end="00:46:23.840" style="s2">bit to you know gym ruts material Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.930" end="00:46:26.619" style="s2">Hall and &#39;shmock dan berger talking here</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.840" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">and on rebel wisdom and elsewhere but um</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.619" end="00:46:38.900" style="s2">yeah i think the part of this right is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:42.349" style="s2">is how much of a host materialist or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.900" end="00:46:44.990" style="s2">materialist phenomenology are we going</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.349" end="00:46:50.320" style="s2">to allow ourselves to reintegrate and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.990" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">remediate I don&#39;t think that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.320" end="00:46:56.599" style="s2">post-capitalist feature that retrieves</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:47:01.160" style="s2">the village etc is going to be the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.599" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">kind of secular anthropology that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.160" end="00:47:06.470" style="s2">moderns and westerns have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:08.840" style="s2">engendering you know maybe part of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.470" end="00:47:10.339" style="s2">will you know and maybe game B is more</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.840" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">interested in kind of looking at meta</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.339" end="00:47:15.859" style="s2">systemics and game theory etc but part</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:17.540" style="s2">of this and this is sort of what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.859" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">really like that Steiner is bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.540" end="00:47:23.210" style="s2">of course but then gaps are also really</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:26.869" style="s2">frames very very usefully is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.210" end="00:47:29.480" style="s2">okay well we are not merely modern sight</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.869" end="00:47:33.099" style="s2">there&#39;s other modes of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.480" end="00:47:33.099" style="s2">world that continue to persist</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.430" end="00:47:39.109" style="s2">interpretive there mutation so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.050" end="00:47:41.300" style="s2">magical the mythical the soul oriented</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.109" end="00:47:43.790" style="s2">the folk oriented all of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.300" end="00:47:46.190" style="s2">capacities not only continue to exist</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.790" end="00:47:48.050" style="s2">but also involve themselves in rational</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.190" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">thinking and in secular culture in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.050" end="00:47:53.890" style="s2">sort of invisible ways so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:55.670" style="s2">interested more in this sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.890" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">anthropological turning where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.670" end="00:48:00.710" style="s2">actually bringing that back in as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think everyone needs to in</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.710" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">that sense we all have different</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.940" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2">dispositions but I do think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:09.260" style="s2">of the part of the story here and only</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:12.140" style="s2">framing it in terms of kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.260" end="00:48:16.280" style="s2">thinking and secularity is very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.140" end="00:48:18.470" style="s2">a Western centric modernity centric way</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.280" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">of thinking about this planetary crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.470" end="00:48:21.770" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.030" style="s2">Ellucian whereas you know this look at</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.710" end="00:48:29.660" style="s2">necessarily secular in that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.140" end="00:48:32.990" style="s2">still today right it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.660" end="00:48:37.460" style="s2">transformation to you know it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.990" end="00:48:39.740" style="s2">the secular West&#39;s planetary culture so</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.460" end="00:48:43.460" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a plurality that we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.740" end="00:48:45.020" style="s2">to consider and certainly like I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:46.990" style="s2">with the consciousness culture obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.020" end="00:48:49.850" style="s2">like we talked about Steiner and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.990" end="00:48:53.990" style="s2">psychedelics and spiritual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.850" end="00:48:57.500" style="s2">etc and of course engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.990" end="00:48:59.270" style="s2">indigenous cultures and First Nation</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.500" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">cultures and communities that are still</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.270" end="00:49:04.070" style="s2">present today so again I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:06.770" style="s2">more pluralistic universe you know and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.070" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what the turning could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.770" end="00:49:12.020" style="s2">in that deeply phenomenological sense is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:14.300" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an overcoming of our own and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.020" end="00:49:16.520" style="s2">this is an inquiry in an invitation for</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.300" end="00:49:19.610" style="s2">us I think it&#39;s an overcoming of our own</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.520" end="00:49:23.390" style="s2">fixation on the phenomenology that has</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.610" end="00:49:26.690" style="s2">you know so identified modernity for so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.390" end="00:49:29.510" style="s2">long the spatial orientation and get</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.690" end="00:49:31.310" style="s2">into like more of that detail but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:34.340" style="s2">think it&#39;s this isn&#39;t opening up you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.310" end="00:49:36.260" style="s2">know this is not meta modernity this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.340" end="00:49:38.300" style="s2">meta something else meta Planetary</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.260" end="00:49:41.480" style="s2">planet ization I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.300" end="00:49:43.370" style="s2">there&#39;s no words for it but um I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.480" end="00:49:44.600" style="s2">part of us is exploring that as well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.370" end="00:49:46.030" style="s2">not sure if that directly answers your</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.600" end="00:49:49.570" style="s2">question about game being the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.030" end="00:49:49.570" style="s2">anthroposophical views</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.849" end="00:49:58.660" style="s2">awesome we&#39;re getting a kind of near the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.710" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">end so they&#39;re probably only be one or</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.660" end="00:50:02.440" style="s2">two questions left but I&#39;d be really</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">interested to hear from Fred about his</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.440" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">question if he&#39;d like to unmute himself</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.490" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">we can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.249" end="00:50:24.759" style="s2">there you go that should work wheelchair</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.890" end="00:50:28.630" style="s2">America know each other because I&#39;m fan</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.759" end="00:50:33.910" style="s2">of his Gibbs of course and to me gaps</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.630" end="00:50:40.420" style="s2">were a very important thing to say we go</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.910" end="00:50:42.759" style="s2">from it&#39;s an evolutionary development in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.420" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">which he says at the moment we go from</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.759" end="00:50:50.430" style="s2">the mental to the integral and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">that the integral has definitely an</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.430" end="00:50:57.490" style="s2">inherent spiritual aspect to it and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:51:00.519" style="s2">also transparency and also to what</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.490" end="00:51:03.579" style="s2">ferritin are part of the failure system</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.519" end="00:51:05.829" style="s2">if I look at what is happening with</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.579" end="00:51:10.089" style="s2">George Floyd if we want to be present</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.829" end="00:51:14.980" style="s2">that&#39;s very much what is on each that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.089" end="00:51:18.099" style="s2">a inner and outer scream it&#39;s what I see</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.980" end="00:51:22.269" style="s2">definitely by young people is that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.099" end="00:51:29.319" style="s2">is a very deep feeling of equality that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.269" end="00:51:32.710" style="s2">wants to show up and in that sense this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.319" end="00:51:34.930" style="s2">this the risk is shift from this ratio</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.710" end="00:51:37.930" style="s2">thing which has very much to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.930" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">kind of the white people being very</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.930" end="00:51:45.339" style="s2">mental and now shifting to something</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:48.279" style="s2">that is inviting more a deeper variety</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.339" end="00:51:53.890" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s what brings me until</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.279" end="00:51:56.980" style="s2">the the feeling of why not look at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.890" end="00:52:01.529" style="s2">aspect of which of the failures that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.980" end="00:52:05.470" style="s2">see now showed up which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.529" end="00:52:07.550" style="s2">universal love is part of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.470" end="00:52:11.930" style="s2">going and then equality has very</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.550" end="00:52:14.810" style="s2">much to do with that and so instead of I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.930" end="00:52:19.340" style="s2">find that don&#39;t pray in very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.810" end="00:52:22.670" style="s2">head concepts going into a more feeling</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.340" end="00:52:26.810" style="s2">concept of could that be possible that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.670" end="00:52:32.920" style="s2">the human stage that we are coming into</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.810" end="00:52:36.280" style="s2">now is hard based from there thats a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.920" end="00:52:40.550" style="s2">different value systems are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:43.940" style="s2">lets say created also which will also</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.550" end="00:52:53.330" style="s2">deeply affect the let&#39;s say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.940" end="00:52:57.770" style="s2">value of what we call you know to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.330" end="00:53:00.920" style="s2">genius is being fairly rich what we now</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.770" end="00:53:03.590" style="s2">see in the in the crisis is that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.920" end="00:53:08.540" style="s2">with so-called common professions like</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.590" end="00:53:12.260" style="s2">teachers and are seen as well so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.540" end="00:53:16.430" style="s2">a deep value shift in those aspect so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.260" end="00:53:21.080" style="s2">would love to if the liminality is</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.430" end="00:53:27.320" style="s2">perhaps also an acknowledgement of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.080" end="00:53:29.450" style="s2">need for an emotional maturation yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.320" end="00:53:31.550" style="s2">think that that gets to part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.450" end="00:53:36.530" style="s2">heart of it right Fred um good question</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.550" end="00:53:38.630" style="s2">I think first of all if we take what</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.530" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">gebser says at least and I think other</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.630" end="00:53:44.390" style="s2">theorists about cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:47.180" style="s2">discuss I&#39;m thinking of Ursula K Le</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.390" end="00:53:49.580" style="s2">Guin&#39;s Lion from one of my favorite</p>

<p begin="00:53:55.850" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">so this is just this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.610" end="00:54:04.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve been so over oriented towards this</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:06.440" style="s2">once a sighted fixation towards</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.680" end="00:54:17.870" style="s2">so much momentum that our our sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.590" end="00:54:21.380" style="s2">making is so oriented around the mental</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.870" end="00:54:25.730" style="s2">it&#39;s so fixated that a reversal</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.380" end="00:54:27.320" style="s2">is almost it is the intelligence of I</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.050" end="00:54:36.380" style="s2">is or the dowel I suppose maybe Lagoon</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.740" end="00:54:39.110" style="s2">would say that is calling forth a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.380" end="00:54:42.440" style="s2">reversal a reorientation a restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.110" end="00:54:45.320" style="s2">the Alaia if order is is asking of it of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.440" end="00:54:49.330" style="s2">itself right and the crisis is revealing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.320" end="00:54:53.180" style="s2">that of itself that reversal return</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.180" end="00:54:58.820" style="s2">know you know that kind of arc of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.210" end="00:55:01.070" style="s2">modernity is being inverted and reversed</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.820" end="00:55:02.600" style="s2">in all of its tendencies all of its</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.070" end="00:55:05.510" style="s2">sense-making tendencies because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.600" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">been so one-sidedly fixated it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.510" end="00:55:08.690" style="s2">to destroy us if we continue that way</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:11.030" style="s2">and the answer is not to continue</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.690" end="00:55:13.010" style="s2">pedaling harder that way either right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.030" end="00:55:16.460" style="s2">in terms of heart-centered yes but also</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.010" end="00:55:18.020" style="s2">and got centered and mind centered like</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.460" end="00:55:19.880" style="s2">and this is the whole this is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.020" end="00:55:22.670" style="s2">McLuhan turn this is the integral turned</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.880" end="00:55:24.200" style="s2">with cap sir this is the simultaneity of</p>

<p begin="00:55:43.370" end="00:55:48.350" style="s2">crisis has been the heart because that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.370" end="00:55:51.350" style="s2">does need to be remediated the</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.170" end="00:56:06.310" style="s2">institutions to to care right so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.730" end="00:56:08.690" style="s2">mean that there&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.310" end="00:56:11.330" style="s2">dehumanization and alienation from self</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.690" end="00:56:16.250" style="s2">and other that this form of culture has</p>

<p begin="00:56:16.250" end="00:56:20.060" style="s2">reversal is needed but the reversal is</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.170" end="00:56:22.460" style="s2">not just an undoing it&#39;s a retrieving</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.060" end="00:56:24.560" style="s2">and integration and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.460" end="00:56:27.350" style="s2">that&#39;s the the challenge we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.560" end="00:56:31.250" style="s2">work through because what we see right</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.350" end="00:56:33.590" style="s2">now is you know a lot of overemphasis in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.250" end="00:56:35.150" style="s2">some degrees of things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.590" end="00:56:37.000" style="s2">unintegrated that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.150" end="00:56:40.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve been slapped off that have been</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.000" end="00:56:42.950" style="s2">disintegrated and part of that is yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.010" end="00:56:45.950" style="s2">the Commons human centrism mutual aid a</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.950" end="00:56:48.530" style="s2">society that engenders that and values</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.950" end="00:56:51.770" style="s2">that at its center those are all things</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.200" end="00:57:45.500" style="s2">one thing that I I just found let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.540" end="00:57:48.890" style="s2">two weeks ago the idea that if we really</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.500" end="00:57:52.580" style="s2">look back from let&#39;s say evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.890" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">point of view we have now and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.580" end="00:57:59.360" style="s2">for the first time we have cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:58:04.490" style="s2">Genesis the biogenesis and with yet</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.360" end="00:58:09.770" style="s2">cyril homo genesis stages and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.490" end="00:58:12.980" style="s2">idea of the shift from let&#39;s say how</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.770" end="00:58:19.550" style="s2">many to the the ape he lives in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.980" end="00:58:23.930" style="s2">world in which let&#39;s say there is very</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.550" end="00:58:26.440" style="s2">much the prey and the predator and when</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.930" end="00:58:29.960" style="s2">I see the human being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.440" end="00:58:30.530" style="s2">integrating its in itself the prey and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.960" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">the predator</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.530" end="00:58:37.070" style="s2">we are also victims and we are creators</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:39.610" style="s2">and in a certain sense if you then see</p>

<p begin="00:58:39.610" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">related to the prey because the defense</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:49.810" style="s2">the looking out is it dangerous not</p>
